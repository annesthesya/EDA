Recieved wrong costume
did not meet my expectation and I did not get any reply from the seller
"One of shoes (the right) was clearly bigger than the other.  I had a friend try them to make sure it wasn't me and she knew immediatly what I was talking about.  As expensive as these shoes are, I feel like these must have been ""seconds"" due to poor quality of this pair.  I had ordered another pair in size 37.  When they arrived they were size 39 in the box marked 37.  Be prepared to send them back.  I finally got another style and they were fine.  Third time was a charm."
"Stained the first time I used them ;(
And don't stay rolled.

Usable for the money but was disappointed"
"Aside from the fringe, there is no green on this shawl. Very disappointed in the color, although the fabric and texture are nice. Size is good-just not what I ordered."
"Runs small, I read so many reviews and I can't believe how people found this true to size. I'm curvy with a smaller waist a bigger booty, I wear 16 size jeans in pretty much all brands and this one was super tight. No stretch whatsoever so beware before you buy this."
Not really sure how to rate the size it was wide and short. Like for a chubby short child. My son is a normal 6 year old and it barely covered his waste but was wide. I've washed it a couple of times but won't dry it. I can tell it won't hold up at all and will probably shrink even shorter.
I didn't like the fit nor the lightweight quality
"Horrible. Doesn't work, pulls, and sticks everywhere but where it should!"
"The medium I received was too tight to wear.  When I put it beside the medium I bought several years ago, this new medium looks like a small.  I'm going to order a large in the hopes that it the same size as the old medium.  I wear a 71/8 so it should have fit.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Bomber-Leather-Bomber-Hat-with-Real-Rabbit-Fur-Black-Medium/dp/B00879UX4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Bomber Leather Bomber Hat with Real Rabbit Fur, Black, Medium</a>"
"Didn't know how many stars to give this. The gloves are very good just might not be too rugged judging from the feel of the leather. The problem with this product is the sizing. It is terrible. I have medium sized hands and the extra large just fit, are very snug. What you get with cheap foreign labor and no quality control. Probably wouldn't recommend or buy another pair."
"Too small, cheaply made. Will not purchase again."
My son had these for about 1 month and already ripped and has a hole in the toe.  Granted he is 4 years old and has a lot of energy but no more than your typical 4 year old boy.  He loves Ninja Turtles so these shoes were great at the beginning.  He is so sad that they can no longer be worn.  They were comfortable and fit true to size.  Just poorly made.
"I was looking for a suitable pants for beginner hiking for some time and I was very excited to find these on amazon. Unfortunately, they are too small. I usually wear 10-12 in pants and jeans, sometimes 14 if the material is not stretchy, so I trusted the size chart as well as some reviews that suggested that size L would fit perfectly. If you have wide hips as I do and thick thighs (I am very much pear-shaped), then definitely should go a size up. I wish I had order XL since the material is not stretchy at all, and doesn't allow me to move freely. Also when I sit or bent, my lower back gets too exposed which is the opposite of what I was looking for. Too bad since I like the pants, they seems to be a good quality and can't beat the price.
I suggest to follow the actual measurements rather than sizes."
Just did not work for me. Cute shoe!
"I have fat feet and even on me they were a bit clunky. I ordered the iguana sheen, but it should've been called ""Oil Slick."" The picture makes the  top part of the shoe look semi-olive green with iridescent highlights, and since it was called iguana, I thought that's what I'd get. Wrong. They don't go with ANYTHING."
"worst !
Don't buy it , its made of the cheapest material -.-"
If you are a 2X...order a 3X to be comfortable
Gets Ruin fast
Way too small-and I went off the sizing chart and read reviews. My sister who normally is a size 8 put this on and it fit her up top like a glove and was loose and flowy like the pic!!!
This runs small.  My daughter tried it on and burst into tears
"I purchased this Neff beanie years ago, it was my favorite hat since it fit my head perfectly. I rated this 5 stars. But since that beanie has been lost I purchased this same hat new again! I was very disappointed to notice its some cheap hat made in China. Simplicity line winter collection is not what i ordered."
"they are labeled xxlg, closer to a med. lucky I had a friend 100 lbs smaller and fit him perfect.  not disappointed in amazon too often. this was a big one.  I knew for the price they were going to be cheap material. I accepted that.  the fit was ridiculous."
Should advertise inches before and after stretch
"I normally love Sanuk shoes, but these tore up pretty quickly. I waited to longer to return them, but I was pretty disappointed in the quick ware."
"Another reviewer already summed it up - terrible, terrible, F- design! The shoe has hard edges all around where your foot goes in, with no ""roll"" in the material. It's almost like whoever designed it has never worn shoes before. Too bad. It looks good, but it feels awful."
"I received the wrong item and due to my location, i would incur a cost to return. Great inconvenience for me. Now i have a skirt that will simply go to the trash, along with the money wasted on it"
not excelent quality its good
Hi guys if you looking for watch with feel and weight of little expensive machine this one it's not your watch. Just picked up from post office opened box it's accurate work good but feel and look like second grade school kid watch and that's what I did just give to my cousin in 3 grade I made his dreams come true. And ordered my self real thing. I learned to pay for real thing.
This is sized wrong. I ordered 0-3 months and this was more like 6-9 months
"I am a bra-snob. I'm a 36D, full in front, and generally wear minimizers as they provide the best support. I expect my bras to be supportive and sexy. This was sadly neither. The fabric is soft, but not supportive enough. It failed my ""bounce test"". and I foresee the fabric stretching out along the back strap. It's definitely not glamorous or sexy. I won't be purchasing more of these."
you need a magnifying glass to find these earrings in the bag in which it was packaged. this is the biggest rip off in jewelry. Very disappointed Amazon would let this false description of products appear on its website.
Cute but to big I washed took tags off can't and don't send back so disappointed never again
Real yellow cheap looking.
Sorry to say these boots were a big disappointment! There not water proof as I found out one rainy day! Got home after wearing these are couple of hours my feet were soaked! talked about ringing out the socks. I decided to give one start for being warm before the storm.
"It wasn't anything like this picture. Mine came black and white and very thin!! Extremely disappointed!! I bought leggings to match, but they don't match because I didn't get black or white leggings!! It doesn't even look like the customer pictures!"
"Bought this bag for my 21 year old daughter as a work bag. She said the bag is cute and we both love the wallet however she said the bag feels too square and stiff. Also, we are disappointed that the bag did not come with a shoulder strap as advertised and thus if she did intend to wear it to work as planned, she would have to walk around with it like a briefcase."
"When I first ordered this sweater, I was very excited to receive a basic black sweater. When I opened the package, I was immediately taken back at how cheaply made this sweater is. It looks awful."
"I like the ring, great value. However there the wield is is very rough and irritates the skin. The outside is like a mirror, the inside with the exception of the world it's very rough. Always feels as though something is under the ring"
"I've worn these just a handful of times, yet despite hand-washing and hanging to dry, they already have a hole!  I'm extremely disappointed in these.  I have had good luck with the Assets version, and I expected more out of these more expensive panties, but not only did they run larger than what I expected (and therefore were not as effective as anticipated), they are poorly made."
"To big, not true to size, i returned these"
"i was looking for something that had a longer torso, the large fits, but is snug, and i didn't want it that close fit.  I probably could have ordered a size up and been more comfortable.  Order up if you want it to fit like in the picture."
The strap broke after 1 week of using it.
"I was disappointed in this item.  A few of the hangers were bent together, it doesn't stand well and if hung, there is not enough space between it and the wall to insert earrings securely. It needed to be curved to accommodate earrings."
Appear to make the foot condition worse.
Too small. Wish I would've sent them back
"These shoes began showing wear within a week.  They are five weeks old and have holes all over them.  Unfortunately, I didn't return them within the four week time period so I'm out the money and my son already needs a new pair of shoes.  VERY poor quality."
"Very very disappointed in these boots. Granted, I got a wicked deal and got them for $9 on sale with prime but it was too good to be true. They're warm and well built. That's where it ends. All good qualities are voided but the material adheres to the tread that holds snow to it.  The only thing it'd be good for is glare ice traction. However, here in Upstate NY, snow has already fallen a few times and whether it be pure fluff or heavy lake effect, the snow packs to the bottom of these boots, making it impossible for my daughter to walk. Literally 3 inches of snow pack on the ball and heel of the boots, and we only had 2 inches of snow. She kept having to sit down and punch the snow off to keep from falling. Picture is what was left on after scrapping  Absolutely ridiculous for a winter boot. Even thawing them off inside takes hours and the snow stays packed on tight. As far as sizing goes, she wears a 1 and we ordered a 3 to be able to put on wool socks and make it through our 5-6 month long winter. They seem to run slightly smaller than most brands like Totes ( also complete garbage btw)  They do seem well built minus the fatal design flaw of fabric over the tread. But it's too much of an issue for this mom to allow my daughter to wear them. After 2 wears, they're on their way to Salvation Army and I cancelled the order for ones I had planned on getting my nephew. Will stick with Kamik."
"I'm 6'8"" and I ordered these pants hoping they would fit. It's not often that I can find decent pants with a long enough inseam. Long story short: I ordered size 36x38 and I received pants that were mis-labled and only about a size 30 on the waist. Very unhappy."
Not what I expected at all it does look like photo but the material is so thin you can see right through it the sizing is way off I ordered a 2x and it looks like a medium will not being buying more clothing from this buyer
Not too much else to say really.......the 10-12 size runs small.
"This turned out to be flimsy. I purchased this because I had a trip to London planned, had purchased a convertible carry on that I had planned to wear on my back. I had to have back surgery and was unable to carry it on my back so I purchased this luggage cart. I was optimistic but this damn thing made the travel so much harder. I should have used my small hand truck. This was so disappointing."
Tip of the shoe started falling apart after 6 weeks.
"Good shipping time, but the product did not last long, it peeled off quickly"
RETURNED THESE THEY WERE TOW DIFFERENT COLORS
i am disappointed.  i ordered the same size as levi jeans i recently purchased and these are smaller and really too tight.
"sizing instructions said to measure from heal to toe.  Our measurement came to 9"".  The chart said that would be size 6.  That wasn't even close. They were way too small."
These were the most ridiculously shaped socks I have ever seen; difficult to believe they were actually Gold Toes.  I returned them.
"not supportive at all.  They are comfy for a slipper, perhaps."
Don't ever order out of the USA. Way too small and I ordered two sizes up.
The shoe is very small and tight around the toe area. Otherwise the shoe would have been perfect
Order XL still too small
Button fell off sleeve in first 20 minutes of wearing it.
Hate it.... Its a fabric covering a wire....
"Lost on first use at the airport. Made sure that the clip was locked and secure, but didn't work that well."
Returned. I read the reviews and sized up but it was huge and unflattering.
"Bracelate idea is good. And this is the only good this product has.
Workmanship is terrible - knots are not tight and I had to re do them all. But this did not help 'cause it paints everything that touches. If you wear it with white shirt, sleeve bottom will be black. And finally, if you wear it in the rain or shower, leater straps will stretch and never return again.
Resume - do not buy, never, even don't think about purchasing! This is not possible to talk about product quality if it does not have it..."
This is cheap cr2$p.  The foot doesn't stay centered so that after a couple of steps the shoe is sidewise on your feet with your heal on the ground.  Light as a feather but sooo cheap like featherweight foam.  Id be willing to pay three times as much for a decent well made pair of sandals but everything is made in China now and just garbage.
"Cheap plastic strap. One strap is larger than the other, make the shoe unsafe to wear."
My husband stated it was way to small/thin! Great length!
Good color but too big!
Had to send back too large.
Received a different color combination than pictured. Fit larger than expected.
"Strings hanging out, poor quality. I returned"
i had ordered before a black one that fits great.  this one is way too small around the body.  you are taking your chances
"This jacket was ordered in size 2X. From other reviews of the same jacket, I expected that the sizes ran small, which is why I ordered one size bigger than usual. The arm at the armpit is about the size of a large so it's not at all comfortable. The jacket is still too small even after ordering a larger than usual size. Tried to contact the seller for a return/refund. It's been about a week and I still haven't heard anything back. It's really too bad because I love the style. It's more lightweight than I expected from the picture, but I could live with that... if it had fit. With no contact from the seller, I would give this a negative star if I could. Thank goodness I didn't pay much for this -- I guess the old adage, ""you get what you pay for"" holds true here."
"I won't be buying these again.  They look nice, fit well, and are comfortable but last only a few months.  Not worth the money."
Garbage...very thin material...may not last long...torn off in washer in first use..
The zipper is horrible it barely goes up and down without tugging and pulling for at least a minute. The piece of fabric behind zipper makes it difficult to open boot to put foot in. Very big around ankle.
"This was an out and out waste of money. It was far too small across the shoulders (why?), and had an odd odor. Then, when I tossed it in the hamper, it left black stains on a wet towel. I don't dare wash it for few that everything I own would be darkened.

Oh well, it didn't fit, had multiple other problems. Good thing it was very, very inexpensive. That way, I didn't feel guilty when I tossed it."
Mother and child are so small-very difficult to identify what they are.
"I got a size bigger than I normally wear since the fabric is ""duck"".  They were enormous and 3"" too long.  So I ordered my normal size (1 size down) and they were skin tight and unwearable.  Its a shame.  Great style but doesn't fit."
"The arms and body length of the shirt are fine and proportionate, but the neckline is pretty small with little stretch. I bought this for my 8 month daughter and had to fight to get it over her head. She won't be wearing it again. Granted she is very long for her age and in the 97% across the board for weight and height, but the shirt itself fit fine. The material is nothing to get excited about. Basic cotton, pretty stiff, not very soft. All in all, it's a basic shirt that serves its purpose, with a small neckline. If your child is thinner, you probably won't have a problem with neckline, but the shirt might be a little baggy."
"It looked fine, but shrunk in the wash."
bad print!
Sleeves were to tight. Did NOT fit at all. Returned.
"These are definitely a cheaper version (or knock-off) of the typical comfort blend shirts.  They are not soft at all; they remind me of the stiff shirts I used to get for free when signing up for a credit card on my college campus.  However, the collar is thick and sturdy, which feels like it will keep its shape for a decent amount of time.  The fit is on par with other Hanes shirts.  Overall, the shirts are not good but not bad enough to toss or return.  I'll wear these, but I won't buy from this seller again."
"Ok looking. Sent back as it was way too big. I ordered a Large and I wear a 10/12. It also had a lot going on, too many buttons and such. It was a bit too much for my taste. I ended up buying a more expensive North Face."
"Clip doesn't have a strong clip, so it will easily move around and even fall off.  Still looks nice though."
"Not for people with wider feet!  Instead, I got Teva Women's Tirra Sandal and their front straps help with fitting to my feat!  I wanted to wear these for a trip to cancun, but they were just too narrow!"
I guess we can use it as a bathing suit cover but definitely cant be worn as a dress.
"Umbrella arrived perfect, but every time I used it, the ""spokes"" would pop out. Used three times and on the last time, all of the plastic spokes popped out at once, causing the umbrella to collapse. I was so upset, I tossed the entire thing in the trash. Beautiful to look at but hardly functional."
"The beads were falling apart, but they are giving me a refund I think."
"I purchased this for a gift but received it damaged. It appears that the covering is just some kind of laminated paper over cardboard. The interior is lined with a soft material and has a lot of compartments to hold your pieces...but I can't imagine that the box would last very long opening, closing and moving the pieces around. It would be a nice box if it was made of a more durable material.

The seller however accepted my return request for a full refund with no problem whatsoever.

I purchased this box at a small discount for my honest and unbiased review."
"A little tight in the seat
Haven't washed them yet
Could get worse
I like the material though lighter than carhartt"
It looks like a pajama shorts.
The picture makes u think ur getting these really nice earrings and then they arrive...they are tiny they belong with baby dolls .
size does not match up even for the same color.
"How they can call this a wallet, is beyond me. Its better suited to be a wrist band. I requested a return the same day it arrived."
Not as good as it showed on picture.....
Stretched out after first wash
"This seller states that they are selling leather for an affordable price. However, these are not leather. These are a cheap imitation of leather and I am very dissatisfied with the product. They run extremely small in the calf. Which is problematic when you consider they are riding boots and my calves will be flexed nearly consistently. Further, the reason I wanted leather was for safety while riding. Imitaion provides no protection. So if there is an accident and my leg is hurt from lack of proper protection because I was stupid enough to wear inferior man made thin product, who would in turn be responsible? I am astounded that this company can't just be honest about the material they are using. It's simple. Tell the consumers the truth."
"Let's face it, sleep nursing bras just are not made for women with large chests. (Though they really should be. Who needs them more, right?) I bought another sleep bra before having my baby, from a different company, and while it gives no support whatsoever, it at least kept the girls mostly together and in place during the night. I was hoping I could get a good deal on these bras and get three new ones that would do the same. But these bras are so flimsy that they stretch super easily and half the time I wake up to find myself just falling out of the thing. They're cute, love the polka dots on the one, but I'll probably just end up throwing them out because they really don't do much for me at all."
"Looks nice,  but I never received..."
The shoes were too big in the heel.
Runs small.  Yarn is large.  It is scratchy and stiff.  Pretty color.
WANTED TO EXCHANGE THEM BUT THEY WOULDN'T LET ME. UNCOMFORTABLE. TOO NARROW. WENT TO FAMILY DOLLAR AND 50% SO GOT COMFORTABLE PAIR FOR $0.50!
"Shrunk immensely, my husband is 62, 275lbs, and a 5X shrunk after one wash. He found it to be thin, cheap and pointless. We have since thrown it out."
dose not fit.
I think they should have intermediate measures for wide foot
"Ordered this for my girlfriend, excited that they actually have a wide range of sizes. So we measured to get the exact size and looked for a bra with side support. When she tried the bra on, she hated it though. Her complaints are:

no padding.
too large.
see thru.
itchy.

We really didn't expect any of those issues, seeing as the picture looks good and the description is so nice, but we were both very disappointed in this 64 dollar bra. On the upside, it does actually have nice side support."
"I ordered (and received) the white, nude, and black strappy dress. This dress is BEAUTIFUL!! It looks exactly as pictured and I am so in love with it! The material is also very thick and heavy, making it seem like it would have been a great quality product. However, upon taking this dress out of the packaging I realized it was TEENSY TINY!! Like very very small. I ordered the largest size offered, a large, and it looked like a small or medium, seriously. I am typically a size large or extra large, and this dress would not even fit over my body with the dress unzippered. I could not believe it! Additionally, when I put the dress on (with it unzipped) it began to rip at the bottom seam. Even though the material felt thick and sturdy, it does not help if the seams of this dress (which has a lot of seams given the style) are not well reinforced. I would recommend this dress if you are a size 4 or 6 or smaller, and even then i would recommend a size large! I was so disappointed that I was not able to wear this on my vacation in LA. Oh well. I will say that because i ordered this via prime, the dress came in two days and there were no issues when I returned the dress."
"These shoes are shape-less, with too much width in the toes.  Also, you cannot see your arch.  A very poor shoe.  Not even worth being a house-slipper."
"This stuff may be great, but the lid was loose when it arrived, the interior seal was broken and half the container had leaked all over the inside of the package.  Was in a very large box with one other small item rattling around."
"While I love the pattern and texture of the leggings, there is NO way these are supposed to fit XS-Medium. I'm 5'11, 140lbs; usually wear small to medium leggings. the lace part is fine, but the pleather material has no stretch at all. the black band that covers the model's knees was at my calves, and the crotch of the leggings would come to my mid thighs at the highest.

Don't buy unless you normally wear pants 00-4 and are <5'5."
"Way too tight, I bought a large, I'm a 34-36 C/D depending on the bra, and I know I'm not an XL... I already took tags off so can't return and can't wear because I'm way too squished in.... too sad :("
Shoes are hard and inflexible. Needed them for dinner dance. Suffered thru the dancing.
Did not like the weird padding.  Returned.
"Pros:
-Flat

Cons :
-The material looks really cheap . I bought those thinking i would be able to wear them at work sadly they don't have that ""professional"" look . Its screaming low end and  cheap PU leather . Not the effect i was looking for ....
-RUNS SMALL . im a true US 10 so i ordered a 10 its so small . i had red marks all around my feet wearing them for 15 min ( as you can see on the pictures) . Sadly this seller doesnt offers a size 11 so i can't say if a size 11 would fit or if it would be too big .
-Poorly made
-Poorly deisgn . Costumers should not have to order a size up if the manufacturer bothered to check ""average feet size"" in US  and make sure the numbers are correct with  US sizing .
-WAY TOO NARROW . Ouch . my toes were crushed in it
-Cheap bottom
-No arch support
-Not a good inside sole
-Those flat won't last very long. Not for daily wear .
-Overpriced 19.99 $ when you can find this type of cheapo flats in other stores for around 8 $

Overall i was so disappointed , while i like the idea of the flat ballet design and though they would be cute , the reality of it is far from it . It looks good on picture but doesn't feel good .

Would i buy an other pair ? No
Would i recommend it to friends and family ? No
Would i buy it as a gift ? No

Disclosure : I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Any comments expressed are my personal opinions and from my own experience. I shop a lot on amazon (as a full paying costumer,without any type of discount or sale ) and i read other people reviews before making my purchases too .I understand the importance of a thorough review."
"Midriff was way too small for the bust size ordered.  The cup size was fine and the bra itself was beautiful. However, had to return it."
Collar button didn't look right
"I got this for my mom and she loved it, but then when I tried to put it around her neck it broke. I wouldn't recommend this"
"After 1 week, the hollow sole loses its appearance.
After 2 months, the upper part comes off the sole.
ALWAYS the foot sweats - the inner padding is made of a synthetic non-breathable material."
"I ordered an XL based on the sizing chart. I wear waist size 40 in all other clothes, and these are tight. They fit like boxer-briefs! I'll be returning..."
"I wear a size large, and this L shirt fits like an XL!! And the sleeves are too baggy!!"
Shoe doesn't fit right due to the memory foam.
To thick for kids ear piercings
"Too big for my adult head. The feather was a good quality, sent back. If you have a bifgest head, this might be better for you."
They were too small for my mom.
too tight for my earlobes  but pretty earings
too small. great product
"This product was a waste, the leg area rolls up and bunches under clothing."
don't feel good when I hold it.
I liked the wallet but two years in it's already falling apart and I need to buy a new wallet.
The seam at the toe is thick and rough.  It runs along the top of my toes and hurts.  The socks are very thin.
Hard to figure out size from this company.
Was very disappointed having tried Ryka shoes for fitness. I walk only on the treadmill and had to remove them after only 8 minutes. They hurt my feet badly and I am a dancer... clogging on cement floors for hours... VERY disappointed. I am thankful that these can be sent back.
"its not yellow gold.  its rose gold.  I would have returned it, but it was not that expensive."
"Was defective right out of the box.  The merchant never responded to the complaint and we ate the price - and Amazon did nothing, thanks Amazon.  DON'T BUY, even thought it looks super cool."
My problem is that to me this kind of shiny polyester almost silk-like fabric just isn't what I like to wear as a guy. Maybe it breathes but it reminds me too much of wearing a plastic bag. I did not realize how that would bother me when I ordered it so I sent it back. It was well made but the silken feel bothered me.
"I am VERY familiar with 14k gold and have worn it most of my life. These earrings are no longer even a gold color - they are tarnished brown. Very disappointing given the price. I have not a clue of what metals that were used to make these, maybe they have SOME gold in them, but by no means are they 14k gold."
"I was disappointed with the advertised size and quality of the sandal. It was unlike most New Balance products that I have ever tried. Even with the velcro fastners and Extra-wide advertised size, it was still too small for what I was expecting. I currently wear a leather version from Rockport (it may not be made any longer) and even though it is a couple of years old, it is still more comfortable than these newer sandals."
"I had to return these, I bought a larger size because I had seen that they ran a little narrow.  I loved the look of them but I could never have worn them.  I was sorry to see them go, they were so cute.  If you have wide feet these won't work for you."
There is no padding and the nips do show. I didn't read enough of the reviews. The pic looks like there is padding..too bad. It fit really well just cant do the no padded look
Fall apart...
Much too small. Size chart is not accurate. Returning.
Too high and heels did not feel safe to walk on.
"Very thin material.  Was actually see through.  I bought this with the expectation to shorten it and use it more as a fitted tunic, but due to the material being so thin even when ruched I still was not comfortable that you couldn't see my undergarments."
"Too short, too  tight, too little"
"I went out of my way to find out where to review these. They are purple. They are plastic. They look cheap. I got exactly what I paid for but was hoping I wouldn't... sorry - I couldn't believe it when I saw these online - they look just like my other favorite sandals for so much cheaper... TRUST - They are not. Whoa. Really. You can tell these are just not quality shoes from a mile away - of course - they are not charging for quality shoes... Anyway - try em - you might like em for the price - if you are expecting a bargain basement replacement for your ""other favorite"" sandals like this... nope."
"My newborn was average. She weighed 7 lb 6 oz. & was 20"" long. These never fit her hands."
Fit but definitely see through and easily torn. Decided to convert to wearing Lularoe leggings shortly after this.
I've been wearing New Balance shoes for the past 25 years and they were always the same great shoes no matter which model you buy until now.  I read the reviews and people complaining  that the shoes look cheap but I didn't believe them based on my past experience.  I BELIEVE THEM NOW!!! New Balance has changed I will never buy New  Balance shoes again online.  Only in a shoe store where I can see them and touch them.  I still hard to believe that New Balance has gone this route.  A cheap poor quality product.
"barely fit out of the package, and I like pajamas loose for sleeping in.  Certainly would have shrunk to not-fitting in the first wash.  Also, very thin material.  I returned them."
I really wanted to like these but the silver is extremely malleable and bends easily. I ordered two pairs and both are useless now.
The dress is too small and the wig is light it looks grey. I will never wear this costume.
Does not look look like the pic n its the wrong size idk but its cheap fabrick
"I know they want you to contact the seller but I see no need. I won't send it back because it's not worth it. I don't need my money back because it's not worth it. This so called winter long soft warm scarf is just not worth the five dollars and the waiting period for it. It looks thick but in reality it's really, I mean really thin. I brought it thinking It will shield me from the cold but it's so thin and the color is bright almost neon orange. This was a total waste of money for me."
This is one pair of socks! This is the most expensive pair of socks I've ever bought!
"'Thick"" means Very heavy/lined.  Way too warm.  Description should be more clear"
"I got these for my grandmother. They fit her taste, as she wears mostly gold jewelry and often white or things that match white. She likes them very much but said she will be using with the clip-on earring cushions I bought her since they are comfortable while wearing but cause pain after being removed.

Update: I am downgrading from 4 stars to 2 stars because my grandmother reports that the earrings are even more painful with the earring cushions on, and she can't even keep them on through an entire dinner, with or without the cushions. Also, I saw them in person and they are much larger than I expected, about 3/4"" by 3/4"", not as delicate or as gold gilded as the picture implies. I told her to re-gift them to someone else."
After only a few washes this has large holes where the armpits are. I've only worn this maybe 10-12 times.
"I bought this purse because of the many zippers and it being vegan. But.....it is SO DIFFICULT  to find anything due to its severe  'lack of' structure.' It is very flimsy......everything falls down and even with zippers and all.....I find myself searching for things that I should find easy.  I have tried to like this purse, but its gotta go."
This bra just didn't work for me.  Perhaps in smaller sizes it would b good but for a C cup it was just too much.  The cups are set very far apart and the padding is too much.  Every time I bend over I shift or fall out!
"I wish I could return these but bought these on a whim and took them on vacation, didn't try them
On till I got there and they are just too narrow. Very cute but too small."
"I wanted to like this bag, however, it's very cheap looking. Almost looks like shiny plastic. Has a funny chemical smell too. I am returning"
Comfortable BUT there is a gathering of extra material between my legs that feels a bit like wearing a diaper. I can get used to that.  And my scrotum is now sweaty. The keyhole pouch next to my thighs isn't very breathable or just collects the heat. Either way my underwear are damp. And the lint...little black lint balls still forming in my crack. Even after 5 or 6 washings. And this could all be my body in this material IDK. I am a 6' 190 lbs avg build. I won't be buying them again.
"Great print, but too short and just not proportioned right for my body."
They have lost all sense of sizing.  There is no consistency across L - XL - 2XL.  These Ts are nothing like what Target used to sell.  If you liked the old Jerzees you have to look elsewhere for something like those.
"Service was good and I like the design, which makes it very easy to pack.  In less than six months the zipper was separating from the frame at one corner.  I'm taking it in for a warranty repair to a local Delsey repair center.  Was told to expect a week for the repair to be made and that I might be charged a non-refundable inspection fee by the repair center to even look at it.  Was also fortunate enough to have retained the tag in the suitcase that has the bar code and indicates the product's ID.  Without this tag AND a receipt (easy to get from Amazon), the Delsey web site says that the warranty will not be honored.  This suitcase so far is quite far from matching my old Samsonite hard-sider that lasted for around 20 years and died only when the repair parts for it (a latch broke) were no longer available.

So Delsey finally sent me a new one.  I used the replacement for one trip and the zipper became almost non-functional and the polycarbonate shell cracked near the handle.  The airline told me that the nine inch crack was ""routine wear and tear"".  Only if there is a hole in the polycarbonate shell do they consider it something they are responsible for.  Much as I love the design of the suitcase, it is too cheaply made to deliver on anything than perhaps a car trip where you can give it a little TLC on a regular basis."
VERY PRETTY BUT WAY TO SMALL
"These are huge! I was counting on these being tiny as most Asian sizes are. I'm an xs.  These are anything but.  About the size of a large dinner plate.
Not only are they huge but they look nothing like the photo. (Other than the fact that they are black lace.) At least they got the color correct right?
The bow isn't even a bow its just a crossed piece of uneven cut ribbon  with a few stitches in it.
I've had better luck spending a dollar on eBay for similar items.

They aren't functional as panties but maybe I can take them to the river and catch some fish in them."
My husband said it was too heavy and thick.  We ordered the -6MM Tungsten Carbide Wedding Band Ring w/ Black Carbon Fiber Inlay - which he loves.  If the person that is going to wear it is used to a heavy ring they may like it.  It is great value.
I don't like this wrap. Its too short. I thought it would be almost floor length but its more like above the knee and kind of tight.
"I purchased this hoping it would be a quality fit. I was disappointed.. Frankly, I prefer Peter Millar products."
Blue is darker than the picture shown.
"Lasted 1 week then the chain broke and the strap was very cheaply made. If I could give it no stars I would,"
"Very cheap material,  it all came apart the first time I used it."
"Although soft and cushy, the sandals have zero support for the foot, and my foot was sliding side to side dangerously, I had to return them"
These cleats are made with poor quality materials in the upper portion. I used them last night for my game and they hurt my feet (with insoles). So uncomfortable....i will not be using them again...basically wasted my money cause I need to buy another pair.
"Loved this bracelet, although I only got to wear for about a week it broke right after, also Mine came without the cross which I didn't really mind because I liked it so much. Too bad it didn't last :("
WISH I COULD HAVE RETURNED THESE.  TOO SMALL.
"I purchased this leggings for my wife Christmas gift, the shipping took 20 freakin days!! Order placed on Dec 16, Order shipped on Dec 18 and arrived on January 6!!!! I ordered stuff from China that arrived faster than this thing. Now The leggings that we got it was not even the Mopas brand, it was some Spanish brand, the material is so cheap and feels like the stuff that you get from the flea market. After 2 days wearing them, the leggings became fuzzy and just look horrible. Spend your money somewhere else, I don't recommend this product"
Very cheaply made. Material was plastic-like. Very hard and uncomfortable.  Returned it.
"I tried on these same jeans in a JCP but ordered from you thinking they would be the same, but they are not at all.  So I will be returning them to you and going to JCP for them.  I should never order clothes online!"
Super skinny on the leg but way too wide on the waist. Will never buy again.
"XL? not really!!, the bra doesn't fit a 44DD . I ordered this to have a nice fitting relaxed bra. Well the ""Girls"" decided to slipped out when I reached up for anything. They will work for a smaller busted woman but not a plus size gal"
Size isn't right.
"I am familiar with this type of lock. I have never had one break before, but the TSA agent that examined my bag broke one of these locks.
He then left it inside my suitcase. a Colossal waste of  money"
"I don't think I've ever given 1 star before.  In my humble opinion, this is not a ""jean."" Lightweight fabric (NOT jeans fabric), beige pockets on the inside, and high rise fit, rather than midrise. Sorry, I cannot recommend. Sent mine back and found a pair of Levi's on Amazon."
"Good thing the 'Removable dual density EVA insole' is removable.
So the first thing you're going to notice when wearing these is that it has an insole that supports/forces an arch on the foot.

I have a semi-flat arch, which is the reason why I decided to try out this shoe.
So the first few minutes of wearing these hurts my feet. Then after a bit it feels really nice physically because the insoles forced a healthy arch in my feet and every step kinda feels like a massage for a while.

The problem comes when I wear these around frequently as my normal shoes, then need to do something athletic without these shoes on. I get these stabbing pains in my feet if I try to jump or move around quickly on the balls of my feet without the shoes. I tried to see if it got better over a few months, but it's the same if I use those insoles. So I had to switch back to a flat insole so I stopped getting foot pains during athletic events."
"Bracelet is ok, nothing wrong with the product  but a bit underwhelming as it looks cheap.  I will be returning."
"THESE THINGS RUB THE HELL OUT OF MY HEEL

I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THEM
CHEAP CONSTRUCTION, AND THEY LOOK KINDA WEIRD"
Way too big! Does not compare to Ray Ban sizes!
"I bought this shoelaces to replace originals on my Merrell's boots.
Although HHH-34 shoelaces ""feel"" like a good quality item, they just won't stay tied, so I have to tie my boots with double knot.

Can not recommend this product."
"The foam cushion material is prone to tearing. It is the weak point of the shoe as it is soft, but must flex whenever the toe bends. This causes stress on the material, and it tears where it is thinnest (along the sides of the toe where the straps fasten). It seems that of all the keen shoes, the foam is thinnest on this model, since it is designed to be lightweight.

I only wear these shoes for simple tasks a few times a week, for a few minutes each time, mainly for going out to pick up the mail or take out the trash.. This mainly involves walking on smooth concrete. Over the 1.5 years I have owned these, I've probably only used them for what would equate to 2-3 months of daily use. Over this time, both foam cushions on the shoes have torn in 3-4 places per shoe. The rubber sole has V grooves cut into them, which do not wear well. The tread is really light and balds easily. These would be great beach/lake shoes, but are not durable enough for daily use.

Other than the durability issue, they fit well and look decent. The sole contour is great. The back strap against the heel is a bit tight before breaking it in, and rubs your ankle at first. They do smell a bit if worn without socks, but wash easily.

The manufacturer's site shows that they have a warranty, but it only lasts for 1 year. Usually good shoes last me 5-10 years of daily use, so this is quite disappointing. If 1 year is a good run for you, then the manufacturer warranty would make these a good purchase.

Update: even though my shoes were older than 1 year, KEEN was nice enough to give me a credit to make a purchase from their site, which covered replacement. I wil, try to pick one with a thicker sole and uppers that are are a bit more substantial. I hope they fit well and last once they arrive."
"The quality is not good, feels very cheap."
Bad quality only the color is the same as the photo but otherwise looks like a pj nothing cute. Irregular sizing problem. Don't waste your money.
"I love the look of the shoe, but very uncomfortable.  The leather doesn't have any ""give"".  Soured me on ordering shoes on-line."
We bought it to see how our one year old would look. The head piece looks stupid on him.
I tried to see if sandals with strap between my toes I can tolerate but no it just bothers me and it just got worse so this one is no go for me.
"The soles were comfortable, but the straps going across your toes are not. Be prepared for them to dig into your skin and cause blistering."
Not the best quality feels cheap good for dress up scientist but she hasn't worn it a lot because it is ichy
The cups for the bathing suit are great but the cups for the bra are way too big.  It was almost great.  The bra cups should have added the support I needed. I am not sure if I received a defective product but I needed it and did not return it.
"For future buyers, you should describe this product as ""wide calf"" boots. They look very nice but I don't have wide calf... and they kind of fit tight on the inside of the shoe. They're going right back. Ahh!!!"
These earrings are very pretty and will go with most outfits. The problem is that the hole provided for the post to fit into is too small.  The earring actually bends when you try to put it into place in your ear. I returned them.
They Cheap Material! They Look Cheap And Feel Cheap.
I am so unhappy with these clogs. The whole outer layer is peeling off. They look terrible. I want a refund please.
"stones almost a AA, but short of that, but nice try, steel is way thin, makes you think they may not stay in design intended. too thin there, but all have their personnel  opinion, depending  on your love of Tanzo's, mine is beyond high....."
"Bought for my daughter for a family vacation. Though the product arrived on time, the left shoe doesn't work and having to return them. Very disappointed as my daughter was looking forward to wearing them. Now I can't find another pair using prime and what I can find is 10.00 higher then I paid the first time. Ridiculous!"
"First observation of these jeans could not help but notice 3 large(1inch) sticthing errors cleary noticable on the thigh of one leg and 2 below the pockets,and no these were not meant to be a fashion statement ,cleary an item that failed an inspection test.also jeans larger  at the waist than expected. Instead of these being put out for sale,the company should donate irregulars like this to charities."
Did not receive springbar removal tool
"Too much lint on it, every time I wash my lint filter is overflowing with it. The first few uses the lint is everywhere on me, my nose, eyes. Expected better quality for 60 bucks. Not worth the price."
"Would like to give a better review, but the label on the socks says women's shoe size 6-9.  Which would be fine, but it has to be in error.  Tried on a sock and there was a good 1.5 to 2 inches extra toe material.  I could never wear them.  Seem to be well constructed, etc., but sizing is way off.  They are going to Goodwill with my next donation"
"Really nice, comfortable fit - and a joy to wear - until about 200 miles of hiking, when they just started falling apart completely.  These just aren't up for heavy use in the outdoors in my experience.  More comfortable then the Darn Toughs, but they wore through and unraveled above the heel at the ankle and along the sides where they contact the shoe.  Won't be buying these guys again unless they institute a life-time replacement warranty policy."
"Fabric looks like it's a year old after one day of wearing them. My son says they are soft and comfortable, thus the 2 stars, but these pants are cheap quality and not attractive after a single wear. I'm afraid to wash them for fear of what further damage might be done to the fabric. I've included a picture of one of the pant legs near the pocket to show what how the fabric looks after one day of wearing it."
"the quality and fabric were fine but it was a very unflattering fit looked like I didn't have a waist at all I have an hourglass shape and this shirt made me look like pregnant i thought about using it under a suit or blazer but there are better shirts for the money that can be worn on their own as well, returned it the company was very good about returns and I have bought several other style shirts from them that are more flattering to my body type.  This may work as a maternity top or for someone who has more of an apple shape already."
"Well my son has some of the classroom brand pants and they fit great. I assumed these shorts would, but they don't. The waist fits perfectly, but the length of the shorts was way too short!! My son would be sent home early from school if he wore these!"
"The socks themselves were ok. However, I selected the Easter pack of socks as pictured and received a pack of giraffe socks instead. It was too close to Easter to order new socks from China. The giraffe socks were cute--I gave them to college-age students who thought the whole mixup was funny."
"I do not really how to state the size of these because they have very weak elastic and do not stay put.  I was really surprised by the poor quality, since most of my experiences with Smartwool have been positive.  I do not recommend these and returned mine."
"It was way too small. The price was fair but I couldn't use the vest and had to give it away. Also, they wanted to charge me for the freight to return it and that wasn't going to happen. They must be making these vests where XXL means regular."
Not the quality I had anticipated. Looks good but feels like you get what you pay for. Band is not for someone with big wrists so I'm giving it away.
"Sag in the legs ""the elephant legs"" look."
This product unfortunately didn't work for my significant other.
"I mainly bought these shoes because they were fun colors and cheap. I've bought reebok years ago and liked them. Initially they were of great comfort and they felt great to walk around in. However, they're definitely not made to workout in, as I am a runner and workout regularly. I've never had problems with any of my other shoes, but these in specific made my feel extremely hot and uncomfortable. They also had no support as needed for when I was running so my feet hurt a lot. Wish I would have just spent the money on a real pair of running shoes. I use these for running to the store or short walks. That's about as good as it gets for these... Quite disappointed.."
Glossy. Scratches easily.
Awful quality. Poorly cut. I had to re-cut it myself. Strands of hair fell out constantly.
"I am short and they are way tooooo long.  I wear a belt with them to keep them up, otherwise they slide down my hips.  They are warm but not easy to use.  I would not buy again"
Actual hat is much smaller than pictured.
Can't even see the stone chips
I'll be returning or exchanging. :(  They are about a half size too small
These things are huge! My baby is 7 months and there is no way she will be wearing these before she starts walking and they are supposed to be b prewalker shsoes. Disappointed
Extremely large and boxy
"I bought it because I was curious and decorative, the downside is having to be used in dark or dimly lit places, preferably even go out at night, because day in the sun will not see anything."
"I really don't like these- they are too tight around the thigh- so I'm going to use them as disposable underwear on my summer trip to Europe.  I'll wear them and throw them out.  For that purpose, they won't be too bad.  It is nice not to have to wash underwear.  I just wish they didn't bind on the leg- and they sort of cut in across the abdomen, because the elastic is thin.  But at a bunch a pair on sale- they'll be good enough, especially since I won't mind tossing them as I go (not out windows, or anything, I'll dispose of them discretely in bathrooms :-)"
I'm returning this shoe. My left foot got terribly chafed in just 5 km run. Although I'm quite used to long runs. Totally disappointed.
Sent them back
I was a little disappointed in this suit. It wasn't super flattering for a busty lady. It fits really weird in the chest.
"Needed a specialty bra for a top I have but this didn't give the effect I wanted.  It compresses the girls too much for me.  If you want tons of support and aren't big chested, this might work for you."
It was cute but it broke off keychain ring the first day
The band broke off after one week of use. Otherwise OK product.
This product has a bunch of fake reviews meant to create a false average rating. I used Fakespot.com to verify this
"Received with wrong colored (light blue) apron. Looks very terrible together compared to the brown one in the photograph. Sadly not at all worth the price, though I loved my last one so."
He swears it is a fake. :(
Size it too small for large
The top of the shirt was not made well at all. Not thrilled with this purchase one bit. Wouldn't order it again.
The shape of the hat is not perfect.  You can use it in a certain angle for it to look good. Really disappointed.
These were really inexpensive.  They were really rough when they arrived. They probably would have been softer after a few washes but I ended up returning them. I did not care for the fit. The back of the pants sat lower than the front so every time I squatted down or bent down (something I do a lot of as a nurse) the back of the pants would pull down exposing my butt Crack! Not very professional!
arms too small donating it to goodwill
Did not fit correctly at all.  Extra fabric at cleavage showed through all of my shirts.  Looked like I had a third one...
"poor quality, very tight fabric."
Too small and still very see through.
"It doesn't look anything as the one in the picture, the color is not the same, price is very low but you get what you pay, not a good deal at all."
The leather was too hard for my liking.  I returned them.
"The material looks cheap and mine came with a lipstick stain on it, returned!"
Would've been a really cute dress but the size chart is not accurate.
"Not a fan, felt/looked very cheap and like they wouldn't hold up long at all. I love Swarovski but these just didn't do it for me.  Unfortunately, I did return them. I can say the seller has great customer service though. My return was not an issue. It is always nice working with a seller who stands behind their product."
"Most of us wear sweats when we want to be comfy, these are not comfy, they are constricting, especially in the crotch, they sit much lower on the hips than as shown in the picture."
Arrived broken. One of the corner button snaps was broke. Unusable as a tray. Returned it no problem.
"The width on this sneaker really caused foot problems for me.....such that I had to stop wearing them.
The strapping features across the front of the show creates a bump inside that can rub on your bone and cause real pain.
I replaced the shoe, thinking it might be the one pair....but found the identical problem with the replacement.
Yet my older pair of Merrell sneakers in the same style do not cause the same problems.
I would never recommend this shoe."
Too large for me in the thigh area.  returned to Amazon.  I thought the boot cut would work for me but just not the right cut.
"The description says Premium Pashmina Shawl Wrap Scarf (70% Cashmere 30% Lana).  This is definitely a synthetic ""pashmina"" style and there is no tag stating the fabric type or washing instructions.  In my opinion it's not one of the better synthetic pashminas.  I will say the color is very nice.  Next time I will order from another seller."
This looked nothing like the photo. Very poor quality.
"Coat seems warm, and decently made for price. I ordered a 4T, which is too small for my 3.5yr old son, who is admittedly tall for his age (40"" tall, 36lbs). However, according to the size chart provided, he should fit the 4T coat (Size chart says 4T is 38-41.5"" and 38-42.5lbs). I took a chance on 4T because they didn't have 5T available and it was only $20. My son tried it on and the sleeves were way too short and he could barely lift his arms to shoulder height (so that means the shoulders were too narrow as well). When I went to return it, Amazon refunded me the cost of the coat and then decided to let me keep the coat, which was very nice of them, EXCEPT it's useless to us. And I don't plan on hanging onto it for 3-4yrs, when my 6 month old might possibly fit it, if winter time comes around when he is the right size. Planning to donate it to some charity for the winter holidays. Seems well made, although I can't really speak to it's wearability (that should be a word... it's not, but it should be)."
"Builder never heard of sandpaper. Sharp edges have permanently gouged my sweat band. Stain/varnish must have been newly applied. Left some on hat band. The thing still reeks. Cheap wood darkened with sticky stain. Maybe worth about 5 bucks after I put a lot of time into smoothing the sharp gouging edges. If you are handy at all, you could make a better one with simple hand tools. I have to question the intelligence and/or  integrity of reviewers that said this thing is great. Buy something else!"
"Too small, and too thin of material.  Returned them."
Look nice but they are CHEAP just as the price indicates.
"Ummm, Sketchers? Hello? What are you doing with your sizing? Please just call these what they are -- WIDE shoes. Way TOO wide. Buhbye."
"I was hoping this boot would be as cool as described, but unfortunately, the sizing was a huge problem.  The foot portion was oversized for the shoe size, and the boot shaft was so narrow that I couldn't get them zipped up on either leg.  This is not a problem with other boots for motorcycling that I have from other manufacturers, so keep this in mind.  The ornament on the front is only fastened in the middle and could easily fall off.  The shaft sides are fabric and the skull design on the side is a rubber paint.  Two different pairs of this brand of boot had the same fit problems.  Keep in mind you need to pay for returns to the seller, even though they may ship for free from their site."
expensive and didn't feel right. Just buy some lace and put it over your boobies why don't yah
waist size fit me like it's two numbers down !! very tight.
"These pjs are ok. The color is a much brighter pink. They are soft, maybe a bit roomier than I needed but that's ok. I wouldn't have bought them if I had seen them. I needed something like that so I kept them but sort I wish I hadn't because I don't really want to wear them."
Got what I paid for not a good quality a plastic zipper does not fit well would not recommend this boot
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU NOT BUY - NOT SAFE!!! I PUT IN THE BATTERIES THE LIGHTS STARTED SMOKING AND IT BEGAN MELTING THE HAT!!! JUST HAPPY MY BOYFRIEND DID NOT WEAR IT COULD HAVE BURNED HIS HEAD,"
The product leaks and insoles make pop noise when walking!  I have another salewa product and it does not make the noise and its waterproof!
"The shoes look great, the insole padding is so high it rubs the top of my foot which becomes very uncomfortable after a few hours. The sole of the shoes are very hard and inflexible!"
Did not like it at all i will be giving this watch away as soon as i find someone to give it to
"running too small , don't buy !"
Looks pretty cheap. The sequins were falling off before it was even worn once.
Quality is not that good for that price....!....waste of money..
"It didn't fit my breast area because it was too small. Cute outfit, though."
Looked like it should have been a patch for a jacket with the black felt on the back
Came with seam split in the front. returned.
"Looks nice, but has NO arch support.  Sole is VERY flexible.  My feet did not like this one.  I would return it, but I already threw the box away."
I don't recomad this dress @ all is garbage
This was supposed to be a WW. That is also what it says on the shoe but it is way too narrow. I returned them.
"I am 5'2"" and weigh 110 lbs this dress was huge on me. I order a small."
"I cannot even believe this is spanx, the quality is terrible, there is absolutely zero control and the medium is more like an X Large or at the least a large. I have to wear a bra with it and thsi piece is the worst spanx product i think they have ever made..literally zero control."
"I was disappointed to find I could see through this item when holding it up to light.  The label also states it is 20% rayon, but the item title refers to it as a ""Classic Wool Warm Thick Fashion French Beret."" The one size is also extremely tight on my 7.5 head size.

I purchased a second Beret from local army surplus for a couple of dollars less, and it is quite thick, and size adjustable. Go that route folks.

Not impressed with this item!"
"WAY too small.

I ordered what I thought would be a mens large for my 16 year old son.

What came in the mail would not have fit a 12 year old!

It would not have fit large boy, let alone a large man!

The material itself is very cheap.  It felt like someone tried to make thread from bamboo, and then to make a jacket from these bamboo fibers.

It was very rough to the touch.

My son LOVED the look and style, but the reality is far from the appearance."
"So sad... this dress is completely see-thru. It is beautiful, but being see thru defeats the purpose of wearing a summer dress, cuz now you have to wear a slip underneath."
Order 4x larger than normal
"These yoga pants are more like tights. The material is very thin and stretchy. After wearing for a day, the band was loose at the top from stretching out. The material is see-thru. Bought 2 pairs hoping for something comfortable. I guess they will be PJs."
This is not PINK its peach....wrong color
The bottoms were a little large. The top was horrible. Not even made correctly. Threw it away. Should have returned for a refund but didn't even want to mess with it.
The top was far too short and it was also buttoned as if this was for a woman's top.  Very unhappy!!
"Sock guy makes another sock that was made for Bolle, which are outstanding. These are a CHEAP version of them. They snag, made f poor, cheap material, and low quality compare to their Bolle sock."
"very short, middriff not something I would wear"
A little tight in the toe area and makes a cracking noise when walking.
too long for 5'9
Product was mis-shapen & I needed to remove foam & re-adjust to resemble horns.
Super cheap and think fabric.
The tie is very short!  maybe a 10 year old max fit  but not for 12 year olds or older.
Not as wide as it seems
These leggings feel like I am wearing plastic!
"Poor quality. I got the black long sleeve and the buttons are not as pictured, silver not black.

Other people said it runs big I got a medium and its HUGE. For reference I'm 5'4 115 lbs.

If it was cheaper I'd say whatever and buy a smaller size but it's way too expensive for the quality/look of it. Not flattering either. I'M SO MAD TOO cuz I want one of these types of shirts!!! Someone tell me where to get it! :)"
the backing is really stiff and the shoe is really heave
I ordered these boots few days ago based on good reviews even though it is still summer here in NY . My size is 6.5 exactly and I always buy size 7 for shoes because I want some extra room for socks. These boots fit very much without socks but you know you have to wear socks in winter! And they don't have half size available here so I am thinking about ordering size 8. I am not so sure... Good thing is they offer you free return so go ahead and give yourself a try.
"It's cute but huge around the neck, and fits rather loosely"
"I ordered the Small/Medium for the Osprey Farpoint 40, Charcoal. I have many Osprey backpacks at home, Waypoint, Quantum, Flare, Porter, Kestrel. My Porter 46 is tearing away at the seams so I had sent it for repairs and Osprey told me it will take 3 to 4 months. Meanwhile, I was looking for an alternative travel backpack. The space in Farpoint 40 was way smaller than the advertised 40 litres. I have the Kestrel 32 which is 32 litres and the amount of stuff I can put in the Farpoint 40 is only about two-thirds of what the Kestrel 32 can hold. I had bought the Farpoint 40 as the Farpoint 55 is way too long for carryon and also too long for my torso.
After putting my laptop and clothing into the Farpoint 40, the frame of the Farpoint 40 does not holds well. My stuff was ""sloshing inside"" if the main compartment is not fully loaded. The laptop compartment was on the outside hence making the laptop ""vulnerable to knocks"" and moving around.
Carrying this for trekking on a full load, the strap was rough and unable to hold the load (about 10kg) well. As the laptop compartment is on the outside, when I open the main compartment, I have to be careful to gently open and place down the cover of the main compartment.

Pros
1. Zipper opens up fully the main compartment.

Features that could be improved.
1. The backpack strap is too thin and soft compared to the Porter 46.
2. The backpack strap is not detachable like the Porter 46.
3. The waist strap is wide and too soft and thin for proper padding. The waist strap is not removable or stowable when using the backpack strap.
4. No rain cover included.
5. Laptop compartment should rest on the back and not the front.
6. The side walls of the main compartment will ""flop"" when the main compartment is empty.
7. One single main compartment with a laptop sleeve inside so that to lock with one lock instead of two now.
8. The two outer mesh pocket is too loose and too short. The 1 liter Nalgene water bottles keep dropping out.

I will look for another travel backpack. Maybe the Kelty Flyway...happy travelling...

Update on 24 June 2014
After carrying 10kg for one week, my shoulders are aching because the strap is too thin and soft. The straps are too close to the center resulting in the straps chaffing into the neck area. This is an extremely uncomfortable backpack for heavy loads. Using it with just a laptop and the main compartment empty, the load was pulled away from the back and downwards. Initially when I tried the backpack, the waist strap was sitting on my lumbar region. When I load the backpack, the waist strap shifted downwards because of the load and it was difficult to walk with the waist strap about my buttocks.
If I could return it, I will, but the shipping costs is almost half the price of a new backpack. Will have to chuck it in the storeroom."
Not even close to a dress. Runs small and thin material
"Cute, little cheesy on the construction, plastic wheels. Its for a little person so it is was it is
Used twice, the sockets where the two handle slides are plastic and already cracked after two usages. Its for my grandson and essentially diapers and a change of clothes, maybe 3 pounds. Its when the handles are extended and pulled using the wheels like a cart as intended,  they cracked
I would not recommend buying this product as its durability is now questionable"
I will not be able to use this product. It was too small. I will have to give it to somebody else. I suggest people to but one size bigger at least. Reef has a great comfortability and king of comfort which I experienced before. But this one was unfortunately too small.
Smells like some cheap vinyl
"Not a good shoe for toddler with growing feet.  Too narrow and hard.  I normally Love Puma, but not this shoe for toddlers."
"It's a fine necklace, but WAY larger than I expected. I'll never wear it."
They're so annoying to put on an remove because they're lined with rubber instead of fabric.
"Absolutely terrible shoes.  These were expensive shoes at around 80$, and they are junk.  They squeak so loud it's absurd.  No normal person would tolerate such crap quality.  I felt like a circus clown wearing them.

I'd expect more from a 5$ pair of shoes from goodwill honestly.  I'll never consider this junk brand ever again.  I just can't say enough negative things about my experience.  Just horrible."
I usually wear a size 8 1/2 medium shoe.  Other reviewers stated that the size 8 wouldn't work because shoes run small.  Not in this case.  The shoes were exactly a 1/2 inch too much for the back heel and the toe box area isn't very deep to compensate for the heel being loose.  I put them on and the strap wobbled around on my ankle when I walked across the carpeted living room.  I sat down on the couch and removed them then went to my closet and pulled out an old reliable pair of 8 1/2s.  I can't really give these shoes more than a one star because I didn't get very far in them.  I also noticed the silver paint was showing through the gold middle strap where it connects to toe box put since I didn't have any way of fixing this problem I was going to overlook it but since I didn't even wear them I feel I should at least note it in my review.
EXCELLENT RATING I LIKE MY MICHAEL KORS WALLET ITS SO BEAUTIFUL ALL MY CREDIT CARDS FITS PERFECT
"Bought this bag after researching necessary security features and trust in the Baggallini brand.  Was on 10 day trip to Italy.  After 4th day of trip in Rome, the crossbody strap broke!  The entire strap on one side came out of the seam because the stitching cam e loose.  I had no way of repairing it to get me through the balance of the trip.  Ended up having to waste precious sightseeing time searching for a replacement bag.  Go to REI and purchase one of theirs!  My sister did and had no problems with hers the entire trip."
"Unfortunately,too narrow and ordered a wide. Returned these."
"xxl way too small. I am 5 10"" size 8 to 10 normally I wear a med for tight fit, large for comfortable and xl for really loose. It was a waste of money and totally bummed me out because it was super cute."
"Not for women with breast size over B! Small breast petite women only, will be sending mine back!!"
"Originally I loved this, but only used it once and the zipper is tearing...ugh"
I ordered a medium black jumpsuit and instead received a small green jumpsuit. Disappointed and cant wear to my bridal shower as green is not in the colour scheme and time is limited to reorder another one.
"I usually wear a size 10 in shoes, but based on other reviews, I ordered the size 11. The midnight blue is a bright navy. The high back was like a furry hug for my ankle and my first thought was, ""Keeping them!"". Then I took a few steps, and, like many other reviewers mentioned, the heel slipped terribly. I considered whether a smaller size would hold them more snuggly to my heel, but my toes would most likely have been squished. I debated for a few more steps whether I could live with the slipping heel, but in the end, the answer was no: with each step they became more uncomfortable. So I'm returning them."
"It's cut fine, but the material is scratchy and would probably grab a lot of lint. Perhaps, a really good wash and fabric softener would help, but I didn't want to risk it and make it non-returnable. I returned it right away."
"Large should be called ""Fat guy size""....it leaves lots of room. Have to have it taken in."
I can literally see the hot glue lines all over the bubble plastic cheap necklace. ..
WAYYYY too small. I ordered a half size up and measured my calves but these boots are still way too small. Returning. Gave two stars because they do appear to be very nice quality... But you might need to order two sizes up!
"Too small, too tight and I am a size 6.  Hugs all the wrong corners and more of a curvy skirt than a pencil skirt."
"My leggings were recieved with the serging thru the rise all doubled over on itself. The hem of the ankles was all messed up. Unfortunately, I let too much time go by with it sitting there and can't return or refund. Too bad, because I have another pair and like them. But quality I guess is hit or miss. Make sure to check every single seam before accepting them!"
way longer than I expected. Nice shirts just too long.
Inseam is very short. From button to crotch it is only like 8 inches! Ordered 52x34 and thats what they are but the top to crotch is so short!
"I read all the good reviews about this backpack and ordered it enthusiastically for my son. Within four months, the laptop side zipper compartment was no longer usable. So we moved the laptop into the inside pocket. Two months later, the front compartment fell open because the zipper on that came apart. Luckily the contents did not fall out! This back pack has been such a disappointment. I initially liked the jar top and thought it would last me at least 3 years. However within 7 months we had to throw it out because it was no longer safe to carry things in it and was no use. I wish Amazon could refund me. The color red and the pattern were truly appealing, but the quality: zilch! I will never order a Fuel back pack again."
Very cheaply made and returned the product.
I bought a 3X which is two sizes larger than I wear. The shirt is way too snug. If you must buy this shirt I suggest buying it 4 sizes larger than what you actually wear.
too tight in general - not as long as I expected it to be either.
"Unless you like your thermals to fit quite snug, order at least one size larger. I ordered a large, the thermal fits VERY snug, and the arms are too short."
OMG - don't get these!  I wore a pair for about 2-3 hours and when I tried to take them off they stuck so bad they tore skin off.  It took a week for it to heal.
I was super excited about the style and the warmth...but when I got it it was way too small. it fit my sister who is like a size 8...when the hoodie was supposed to be an extra large. so I gave it to her.
"Unfortunately the 99 year old lady this watch was intended for could not clearly hear the time nor  was always able press the button properly.

My wife may use it when we are out camping at night.

WRL"
The photo attached to this product is extremely misleading. The wig REALLY doesn't look like what is pictured and i subsequently couldn't use it for my costume.
"used them on a recent trip and the plastic face fell off on the first leg, if the bag were lost it would have no ID."
"Its a pretty shoe, I love the decoration on the heel  but its too tight around the toe.  Its narrow."
"There was a good chance I would have gotten just the three socks I wanted.. I only got two, because there's a pair added that wasn't even in the options above. Extremely disappointed."
I opened the package was going to put it on and the clasp broke this is very cheap quality
I bought some of these because I had some very comfortable boy shorts made by another brand (Hanes) Big Mistake! Fruit of the Loom cannot compare. These were horrible. They only stretch one way and underwear needs to be two way stretch. What ends up happening is that the underwear keep falling down because there is no vertical stretch to them. Just horizontal. Worst underwear ever! I threw them away!
"Picture pretty, reality horrendous. Returned it."
This definitely squeezes. Can't even button snd my normal XL fits large so again am disappointed 3x for the week. Regret every purchase I made within the last 14 days and am gonna write a good review/ feedback.
"The picture looks one way, the actual product another.  I bought this shirt based off the picture, not the description as I should have.  This shirt is black on black and you can hardly see the words at all except if light is shining on your chest.

It's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I think the picture should be changed.  You will not get the item pictured on the product page."
I loved these boots but they were so uncomfortable... I usually wear an 8-8.5 so I bought an 8.5 and they were way too small. Not only were they too short but the entire boot is also very narrow. I couldn't see myself wearing these for more than an hour. They also had pretty poor arch support. I ended up returning these but it was such a shame because they are so cute.
"The shoe looked beautiful coming out of the box and fit true to size.  However, upon putting them on my size 10 feet, I looked ridiculous.  The pointy toe that looks so cute doesn't translate well onto my foot.  I felt like I was wearing clown shoes and they added inches to the front of my feet despite that fact that they fit perfectly.  Too bad.  I've had great luck with Nine West shoes in the past.  In fact, I own several pairs.  This style unfortunately was a miss for me.  If you have small feet I'm sure they'd be really cute."
"These run about two sizes too small. They were sewn very crooked in the foot, toe area. Worse than 2 left feet looking! Also notice the tip of the toe area is VERY FLAT, so if you have super flat toes it should work for you. Had they fit, they would have still looked weird because of the terrible sewing. If you cut off the bottom and had them as legwarmers they'd be quite adorable!"
Terrible! Lights didn't work after about 2 minutes of wearing them! Don't buy these sneakers.
"material already has holes after only the second time being washed
Not worth the price what so ever"
"I had to cut the button holes around the stitching, trim the strings. Buttons don't line up. I have to wear a belt due to button issue. Worst is the the bright red stitching that stands out. Is not shown in picture. They also appear shorter in the picture. They are long shorts. Its my bad for not reading customer reviews. Negative purchase."
Way different color in person. Its like a neon pink.
not the best fit
The material is thin and see thru
Very cheap and see through fabric. I'd be worried to see what would happen when its wet.  Had to return it because of the cheap quality of fabric.
The shoe will last two months
"""It's ok that mine's not movie quality..."""
"Ordered the men's size 5 so that my daughter got her women's size 7, like all real chucks are, right? Wrong! Came as a men's size 5, women's size 6.5. Sending them back immediately...we will see if I actually get a refund,."
Disappointed. Another brand with socks that are too small! They are useless if you can't wear them.
so sad that Levis have gone the way of the skinny jean. low waist and horrible fit. not made for grown men any more. so sad!
These glasses worked well and looked really cool. Then after 3 or four weeks of keeping them very safe and clean... they snapped.
You get what you pay for.  These are inexpensive shoes that are cheaply made.  Served their purpose for a quick dress flat in a pinch but don't expect them to hold up for long.
Rough on the skin.
Loved the shoe but the soles cracked and literally started falling apart after 2 months. Don't get any Adidas shoes with a sole like thus
"Bought these for everyday wear. Worked great at first, then about a month after purchasing, one of the stays plastic teeth stopped fitting together and would not hold my shirts. So I just started wearing two instead of the set of four. Slowly, the rest of the stays teeth stopped gripping. As I am unable to return them, they sit, not able to use. I should mention I even tried doubling over the dress shirts to try to get them to stay but that didn't work either. Huge let down. Guess I will go back to the military issued ones as those have held up for six years."
"Good fit, size etc but cheap quality. After one wash I started seeing holes in them."
glad I ended up not spending much on this one.  the pouch it came in fell apart  before I was able to open it..there were no instructions as to what the tools were for with it...save you money on this one...
It arrived missing a piece so I wasn't even able to put it together
I returned these shoes as they did not fit and I was not sure they were going to help my condition.
Old style tagged item they stopped tagging stated stamping about a year ago way not cool might try some if there around this winter hoping they've worked out yes there is an issue here with that!!!
"Very small.. Not a normal ""charm"" size but if I had read the description, I would have known that before I bought it. There was a 589 stamped on the side which was the deciding factor in sending it back.
Got the feeling it would have tarnished quickly too."
"So there is a a VERY tight strap under the tongue of the shoe that makes entry actually impossible.  I actually ordered a full size bigger than the Stride Rite shoes he has now so he could grow into them but I couldn't even get his foot in.  Too bad, they are really cute."
not what i expected fabric and fit
"super cheap material, not worth the money. disappointed in material and color. Its whiter than white, false advertising as the picture shows something completely different than what i was thinking i was getting. will NEVER order from them again.
It took almost 2months to receive. buyer beware ....buy american."
"Failed again.  Beware an Aisan XXL is more like a medium.  Amazon, please create a filter search for US sizing only.  No returns. "
"Great looking watch, but what the photos do NOT reveal is that the numbers & hands are a shiny, mirror-like chrome that are very difficult to see due to their reflection. That's why I retuned it. If this isn't a problem for you, you'll probably find the watch a good value."
"I have been a Levis jeans user for many years, but have problems getting size 35 waist in most styles.  I thought I would try these Wranglers since they are supposed to stretch over an inch.  I bought a 34 waist that was labeled as such, but they were way too small.  They are even much tighter than my 34 inch Levis.  They have to be labeled improperly.  I also notice that they are very thin and I would not expect them to last very long.  Another pair that will go to charity, since I will never wear them."
"Runs so small, see through
Shorter than pictured"
This skirt is thin and of cheap quality. it was shorter than I expected and it wrinkles easily which makes it look even worse. I feel like you can see everything through it. I don't wear it anymore because it looks so bad. After one washing it looked even worse.
"I purchased these boots last year after noting that they were described as being waterproof by the manufacturer, they turned out not to be. After walking just two minutes in slushy snow my toes start to feel cold, the boots take in water!! They look great and are quite stylish and look great with almost anything. I have big calves and normally have to get my leather boots stretched to fit my calves, with these I didn't need to do any stretching, if you have skinny calves, then these boots are not for you unless you plan to wear baggy pants or thick socks. They are fine if the snow is not slushy, but once there's rain/slush they are no good! They seem as if they would last 3 or 4 winters but as result of them not being waterproof I have to be buying new boots after just one winter, very disappointed. I would have given 1 star but gave 2 because the boots are actually quite stylish."
So mad I knew he would have loved these pants
I'm very disappointed bec I was really.loking forward to wearing these....they r not ordinarily big...they r humongous....returning them for sure.
I do not have a wide foot and I couldn't get my feet in them.  I thought maybe they were women's but the length was accurate.
"Very uncomfortable material, ill fitting design"
These earring fall off all the time
I hate to say it but It looks way better on the model in the picture. The material is not soft cotten and did not fit me the way it looked in the pictures. The material they chose to use is why I sent it back.
What is it about production that can't get the size right? There'a no reason to buy a size that's not the size
Very cheap. Most of the balls break or fall off. Not worth the money
Beautiful but was constantly getting stuck so badly in my hair that I had to let it go I love the look of it but it just wasn't worth it to me...unless you have super short hair lol
Not the kind of material I expected.
"I was very excited when I received as I have a pair of the pants that I use the every time I exercise.  Then I tried on; the top was too big. I ordered the top by the sizing info provided.  After going back online to my dismay you cannot exchange. So now in order to have this top I must:

Package up & pay to ship back
Wait for reimbursement
Re-Order
Hope that the smaller size fits"
"Poorly made, didn't last long"
"They were exactly what I wanted in the picture but when they came I think the box would have fit better!  They were incredibly wide!  Must have been and extra, extra wide.  VERY poorly sized for a shoe made by Aerosoles.  Disappointed in that I liked the style very much.  Sending them back as soon as I can get to a UPS Store."
I bought these for my 5yro and they're snug. He's tall an lean. So I'd go a size up. No
RUNS LARGE. NO SUPPORT.  WILL RETURN. SAD BECAUSE I KLEKD THEM A LOT.
"This item does not fit right, you would assume that a size 18 would actually be a size 18 when in reality it is not. POOR QUALITY, very small for the size. More specifically, when you order from this company it gives you options of specific sizes like (4,6,8,14,18), when the items are revieved they are just large, medium, ect. Clearly not accurate sizing as displayed. Very disappointed"
"Nice jacket but no wat to truly gage your size, it's mire like children's sizing"
I couldn't wear it because is to small and I'm size medium  and the dress is not a good quality
"the brown color has torn off the toes. other than that, the boots are in great shape. Can't wear them with no color on the toe, however. It looks trashy."
"These shoes were heavier than i expected, but the biggest issue is the squeaking. I wore them for a day and people kept laughing at how loud they squeaked! They were not as comfortable as I had hoped either."
Cute just real small for size
Disappointed.. I was excited to receive these only to find out the back is to big to fit into my ears.. Its to much hassle to return them so a waste.. :(
I wear a 38DD bra and so I ordered a 38DD sports bra.  It was so small I couldn't wear it at all.
These earrings are so small that I decided to give them to my niece.  She is 2 years old.
Definitely not what I expected...very ugly looking and I don't know whose pants pocket is so huge to fit such a wide money clip wallet. I would not even give this away for free and I'm now looking for another wallet with a centre money clip. I should have paid more attention to the picture with the money on the inside as you can see how much bigger the wallet is than the money. Regret I made this purchase in an effort to save on some $$.
"Fit of coat is too boxy in chest and mid section.  Not at all as fitted or slim as the photos of this jacket.  Faux leather is good, black color was black but not deep black.  Fit in sleeves and length is great."
These were very nice looking but too big for my taste so I sent them back. Delivery was great and the return was painless which speaks for the seller!!!
Was made uneven one foot fits and one doesnt and uneven on top also doesn't fit on top and I got a large and I'm only 5 7.was going to return but gave it to my sister who fits her ok cause she 5 1
Cheap looking and doesn't stay lit in the dark
They are the worst pair of slippers I think that I have gotten so far.
"This is very nice but I feel like this is going to fall off one day and I will lose my watch.  Keeps coming unlatched.

 This is several months later and I have now decided to lower my rating simply because I cannot keep it on unless I tape the clasp. Thankfully I still have not lost my watch as many times as it has fallen off. The clasp does not snap at all now. I just ordered another watch strap. Should be here any day. But was a nice looking band nothing else."
"I do not have large hands and the one I received must be made for a toddler.  The stone sits on my knuckle and there is no way I can latch the bracelet part.  Very disappointed in the piece, will not purchase any more."
This is just crap. The sizing is WAY off and it is solid green with some NOT lacy crap material; it also hasa felt g string. I needed it for a  cosplay and would be mortified to be seen in it. The skirt has a gap in in it. It's vegan and the perfect color but totally useless.
"I loved my new shoes, other than the faxct that the zipper on one of them broke the 2nd day I wore them. I don't know that I would want to reorder something of such poor quality where the zipper just snapped in half."
Love the print but there's a hole on the pants!
This thing smelled so bad . I brought it for my husband because he wanted a long scarf .. The worst purchase ever.. We washed it three times with downy and wand up throwing it away what a waste of money
Does ok hasn't broken which is good. Doesn't look exactly like Pandora. This is more square Pandora is rounded edges. Nothing beats Pandora
It came broken was not very happy
"Halfway comfortable, a little larger than the ones I'm wearing 10 years. and the separation between the toes is larger and hurts the first few times you wear them.
Also they leave my feet black underneath and I have to scrub very vigorously the dye off with Soft-Scrub and Barkeeper's Friend! I also scrubbed the soles of both shoes last night in the hopes I removed some of the black tar or whatever dye they used. This explains why I gave it a 4 and not a 5 stars. When you look at them they look like they cost $5-10. No way $35! Hopefully this pair will last as long as the last pair which is still in great condition! So in that case, yes, they are worth it.
REVISED: I bought these and put them away for warm weather. Now I took them out.
They cut my first and 2nd toe and it's bleeding now. I can't wear these at all."
I don't really like these.  They are too loose on my foot and are very hard to buckle.  They flop around when I tap dance.  I will be getting a lace up shoe in the near future.
it's cute but it's too long on me! :'( (I'm 5 ft for reference) it stops two fingers above my knees so it's not as cute on me as it would be on a taller person and the closing in the back is really confusing. you have to lace it up manually. also the underwear were way too big for my butt :( but at least the dress fit nicely and it's soft
Great for walking .... My running times are slower with this shoe... definitely do not use with out socks . Design rubs skin off toes !!!!  I did 74 miles last week... I had to change shoes .. my first Brooks... .my hope unfilled...
I was disappointed. Not as cute as picture and small. I bought a whole size bigger and I doubt she'll wear it 3 months. The tutu is not full at all and see thru. And three shades of gray that don't quite match.
It was huge and so heavy!!!
"Nice design in front but im not really convinced of the style at the back.
I like white not off-white.
The material is not satisfactory.
Short sleeve in the label but its s longsleeve in the parcel.confucing."
These bandanas were not all cotton. There was only one which was 100% cotton
Beautiful! But didn't come with a chain and smelt like rotting fish. Soaked it for two days to rid of the awful smell.
it looks nothing like the picture. Someone tried to remake it but failed. The cutout portion is bigger to point you see my belly button and the mid section is very loose. It not a turtleneck its more of a crew neck.
"Well, I had high hopes for this one.  Ordered my typical size, way too big, ordered next smaller, still too large.  Ordered a size I haven't worn since 9th grade.....length was fine, but they are so wide that my toe stuck out very unattractively."
"The only thing I like is the longer length and heather gray color. Fit did not work for me--just too tight in my regular size and too scratchy. Also, at 5'3"", straps didn't shorten enough so shelf bra had zero support which is they only reason I purchased this vs. 100% cotton tank."
"I put these earrings in and 2 days later my ears are infected, swollen, and painful. Skip these!"
not as advertised. these run small. If you order order a size up
Bought two pairs. The 6.5 was small enough to fit a child and the 8.5 seemed like you needed longer fingers. Returned both of them. And one started shedding pretty much immediately. Disappointed.
"I could hardly get this bra on over the top half of my body.  When I was able to finally wrestle it over my shoulders, I could barely squeeze into the medium (I am 34D).  No support.  Total uni-boob.  Sent it back."
material used not good to much for the price
"I is some what tight, I like it looser, I though extra large would be more roomy. Paul"
"Don't buy it, poor quality, narrow, cheap material, cheap stitching"
"You XL are not size 12. Igot black and red, instead of sending them back, I gave them to someone who wears a ten. The fit that person perfectly"
"Bought it for the easy to spot pattern, however our first trip and one of the wheels is wonky, the zipper split, and a seam is coming undone. Never again."
"These looked cute, but had no support on the sole.  I used a padded insert to fix that, but after wearing, the heel expanded and my heel would slip out.  The toe box is also slightly tight, and the nerve between my toes on my left foot got pinched after my foot swelled from wear after just 20 minutes.  I gave them to the Goodwill."
"This shoe grease does work to make shoes and boots more waterproof, but not so great as a conditioner in my opinion. It smells terrible, like an old garage, and I think it must have a ton of petroleum based actual grease in it. There are a lot of other conditioners out there that I feel do a better job, have more conditioning ingredients and smell a lot better. Bought it because of all the great reviews, but I sadly disagree with them. Not sure why I'm keeping the can around, as I always reach for other conditioners first."
"Have to return it -- I got a size larger than the largest size I ever wear, and it's still a bit small and super clingy, so it shows every bulge. Probably looks nice on someone with a perfect, teenage body."
"I ordered a small & Im usually a medium & it's a tiny bit to big like saggy on the thighs but material is good quality & is darker than the originals at Tillys? Not original but looks authentic but the tags are stitched right over as you can see on pictures, I kept it bcus it is $10 cheaper than originals & after cold wash it kept the color"
Loved the color!! Very flimsy...no shape and the handle is very short unless you have very short arms. This item was returned.
"I like the style of this watch, but it died out in 2 weeks and did not come with any manual. can you replace this watch with the same one
and if you back up your items, I am going to get more but I will wait until you come up with a decision. Joseph

 New Cool RPM Turbo Flash Digital LED Sports..."
Disappointed with this shoe. It isn't very comfortable as the materials seem/feel quite rigid and don't conform much to natural shape of your foot. There is also very little grip with the bottom of this shoe and if you're walking on a wet surface do so with caution. It's almost as if it's made of a hard composite plastic. I doubt that I would purchase again.
I don't have a big head or a lot of hair...great  for preschoolers..fits a toddlers head
This by far is the worst purchase I have ever made on amazon.. dress is not at all like description or picture.. there was a hole in it and it's was way shorter?? Wtf.. I'm beyond upset at this product
I honestly wish I could return it and might try to find a way. Its wayy too short. I was expecting it to come down to my belly button and instead its like right under my boobs and I am not one to show my tummy. Especially since the picture didn't show it like that.
Really like these shoes.  The problem is that the way they are shaped it hurts my feet to wear it too long.  It is hard for me to find a comfortable pair of shoes so I do not blame the shoe people.  Have higher heels that are comfortable.  Just think the shape of the shoe is not for me.
They are cut too low for me and hurt over the foot. Very disappointed.
"its not like what it looks like in the picture, and the size must be child."
This bra runs small. I exchanged it once and decided it wasn't for me. It is a pretty bra. But it had too much stretch and the cups run to small. Spillage
i got about 5 weeks use out of these boots before the sole split open
"Although this shirt looked beautiful in the package, wearing it is something else. I ordered an 18.5 inch neck because I am a big guy (5'10"" --  250) but I could not even button this shirt and the length barely came below my stomach.  It is a shirt for a thin person with a fat neck."
Its a good quality box but the panels and the pillows are very low quality. The pillows are very stiff.
Although these are cute they are not practical. These are constantly fallen no off my babies feet. I have already lost 2 socks (1 sock of 2 different pairs) leaving me with mismatched socks. If you have no problem constantly checking to make sure your kid has both socks on then go ahead and buy these
"This was my first and last foray into stockings of this style instead of hose and tights.  I'm not very large and these cut at my thighs and itched badly.  I won't make this mistake again.  Probably my fault for choose such a cheap version, but I wanted to see if I liked the style before investing too much.  Now they just take up space in my dresser drawer.  Don't want to throw them away but really can't imagine making myself wear them again.  If you're going to wear stockings like this, spend some money and get the best version you can afford!"
One of the zips stopped working. I am not even sure how to describe the bag. The inside lining ripped and the contents of the bag go into hiding spots that take a while to figure out where the item went. I'm waiting for Christmas to come to give the current owner a new bag and throw away this one.
Doesnt tell which size is which. Just a bunch of spirals thrown into a plastic bag.
Beautiful but got lost the second day. some how it opened by itself and lost it. Very disappointed it. I bought it because i liked the lock...but didn't work as expected.
"This bag appears to be adequate for the money, at first. After a small amount of use, the dye faded into a brownish color that was more evident in some areas than others and looked awful. It became a quick eyesore and embarrassment. That is not usual of Coach products. This is not an item you want to spend your money on, instead go to a genuine Coach outlet or regular store. Just as a note, I have owned many coach bags and still have them after many years and all are in very good condition as they are quality products I don't think this was an unusual occurrence, I am not confident in the quality of this particular item. Further, this item does not come in a box or with any coach literature, dust cover, etc. either, as you would expect from Coach products."
"5feet 2inches, 140 lbs (size 8).  I compared my measurements to sizes listed & L/XL should have fit the bill.  However, the Large/XL size is unbelievably large.  The measurements listed for L/XL size are way, way off.  Large/XL sleeve CUFFS can easily fit a toilet paper roll, that's how big the CUFFS are.  Who's wrists are THAT big?  And the arm pit area is twice that size.....  Santa could fit an elf with himself in this robe, no exaggeration.  Sending back for a S/M with fingers crossed.

+ Robe is soft, double-sided.
+ Knee-length.
- Ginormous sleeve cuffs.
- L/XL measurements listed aren't right."
"Cheap looking,poor quality."
"I have a pair of these exact same jeans, same size, etc. that fit well. The ones received on this order were too large, and I have returned them. It would be nice if the manufacturers did not keep changing the size of what they sell under the same size.

I just ordered another pair,  it is sometime later, These are the exact jeans that I used to buy locally.  I think this pair will fit, but the sizing is so stiff even after two washings I can hardly get them to bend at all."
"The the ""diamonds"" used in these earrings are awful quality. They look NOTHING like the photo representation. The diamonds are milky white, with no sparkle or fire. I completely understand they are not flawless diamonds, but I had family members comment that they looked dull and cheap. The earrings were supposed to be a gift, but they were so disappointing that I just ended up not giving them."
These are terrible. The came in a bag with both soles detached. They did not fit. Way to small. && the shed. I had to give to my mom.
"Wow, I need to start making belts.......really poor quality.....super huge, contrary to other reviews......whatever Bed Stu, cheap Chinese company trying to be cutting edge and so not making it........"
"very cute shirt, however, it is a fit for a junior not a woman.  I were a 3x normally and purchased a 5x and still feels a little snugger than I like. I would buy from this company again. Update...after washing once the fabric ""pills"" up horribly.  Can't wear in public.  I have to use a fuzz comb every single time I take out of washer."
"Update***
I'm used to buying New Balance 11 4E, and these sneakers are tight.
4D seems more like 2D.  Can barely lace them up.
If you're a 2D, order 4E.  If you're a 4E, pick out something else."
"I have worn a size 11 M/D Columbia boot for my entire adult life. These shoes when held up to my old shoes are significantly more narrow. Buy a wide if you normally wear a M/D, I guess ? Otherwise the quality was of high value."
"The bra fit is a little small, but not to bad. Straps are comfortable. The one bad thing is, it's a real stinker. It smells of chemicals. I have washed the bra 5 times. I have used Tide, All and vinegar but it still smells."
"I ordered according to measurements, but it's so tiny! Don't cound on stretch; go 2 sizes up. :-)"
My feet felt very squeezed and uncomfortable on the bottom of my foot after wearing them for 1 hour.
"The sunglasses are great. However, the glasses were not balanced. They were titled on one side. Returned them."
"my wife love them but i was not empressed at all i would not buy them again,but you can ok"
This dress would fit a fat dwarf.......it is very short waisted and comes barely to my knee.  It is not too tight which is it's only saving grace and I can cover up the too high waist with a wide belt. I won't order from this place again.  :(  Oh did I mention the slower than slow shipping. >:(
This top is to small. I'm a larger woman and like a little room to move. These tops do not allow for this.
HUGE!!!!!! I ordered Medium size & it was like EXTRA large. Returned
"I've exclusively bought Bali bras for about 10 years...I'm 36 DD.
I just ordered three, same styles I've worn for years,  and every one has been tight,  scratchy and uncomfortable! What gives, Bali?"
I will not buy these again. These slippers are way to narrow for me and they require to much horsing around with the Velcro strip....not a good fit for me.
"I actually managed to get my arms into this one, but the XL large left an 8 inches gap in the front.  It was hilarious because we autually celebrated when I got my arms through this sleeve after trying four other blouses with no avail. I've learned an XL chinese size is actually a size 6-8 north american."
As much as I like these there is no possible way that I can leave a good review.
"This came within the time stated. I bought this as a gift, it was advertised as $28.95 and when I saw the bill, I was charged $45.98. The item is nice but don't get bated by the advertised price, keep looking for something else.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tuxedo-Cufflinks-and-Studs-Black-Onyx-with-Silver-Tone-by-Cuff-Daddy/dp/B005GC7956/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tuxedo Cufflinks and Studs - Black Onyx with Silver Tone by Cuff-Daddy</a>"
Good solid product as per the fabric and comfort level goes however oto is somewhat tight in the calf area.
"The product is high quality. However, when I received mine compression short. It was defective. There was torn, so I didn't have a chance to test the product for longer period of time."
too bright of a green...
Not a lot of arch support.
"Just felt stupid wearing it so I didn't. I couldn't carry it off. I know I would have felt warm in it, but my husband laughed at me. So that was that."
"Warning! Original price quote overvalued, way overvalued!! There is no way that this watch sells or is worth $129! They don't even tell you where it's made, overseas does not qualify for honesty. I can actually buy a real Swiss watch with Swiss movements for $129 and that is quality. You don't hide the origin nor the origin of the quartz movement! Never heard of this brand and I shop and research watches regularly. You don't need to hide important products information unless your trying to cheat customers. Buyer beware!"
"so surprised when i wore this bra and realized how uncomfortable it was, but by then i was stuck. the fit is akward, loose where it shouldn't be and the straps are not adjustable making it even harder to custome fit. just disappointed...."
"These run very small. I have ordered other Skechers shoes and those fit fine, but not these. Too narrow and too small. Had to return them. :("
"Not a good shoe, don't waist your money..."
I don't like the inserts ai ALL
the shoe size was NOT as expected and I returned them
Way too short in length...sticks out of scrub pants all the time
"This robe was awful. It looked and felt like tissue paper to me. I requested for a return which has already been completed. I already ordered and received a much, much better robe in plaid cotton. No, no, no, this was terrible in my opinion."
"Unfortunately, the high ankle of this shoe hits two pressure points on the front of my ankles and makes the shoes painful to wear.  Too bad as otherwise comfortable and appears to be a great shoe... lightweight, good motion control, and a nice looking shoe. Returned and just purchased what looks like the same or very similar low-rise version of this shoe."
Did not fit on womens boot size 8-9.
"Crap!!!  Fell on wooden floor, only three feet, white painted some numbers disappeared off of bezel' small stress crack in crystal from wooden floor too...  Put it in junk drawer since then...  Half a year ago."
"My previous experience with Vionic shoes was that they were super comfortable. No blisters, no rubbing, no toe pain. This colorful Josie kitten heel looks very cute but thats about it. Its very very uncomfortable. There is no sign of a cushioned sole portion noticeable, the toe box is very uncomfortable and very narrow and shallow. The heel rubbed me sore after less than 3 minutes. I bought 2 pairs, 9.5 medium and 9.5 wide- the sizing is inconsistent- why is a wide shoe 0.75cm longer than a medium shoe?
The medium width felt like a narrow and is too tight while the wide is huge and slips of my feet."
"Eh Save your money. I bought a size up from what I normally wear and it fits fine. I bought this knowing I'd have to make alterations. I love the original DVF dress so much that $15 was a gamble I was willing to take. First off, it's too long. I'm 5'5 and I'll probably have to shorten it about two inches with heels. Next, the shoulder straps are sewn too close together so it makes wearing it look awkward and doesn't flatter your arms. I can have my mom fix those things, but my biggest grudge is the print. It's a lot larger than the original which cheapens it. Oh well. oh and it's on the thin side so nude panties and bra is a must."
Came unstitched the first day I wore it. Poor construction quality which is unfortunate because it was warm and a nice hat otherwise.
"This is very wide at hips, small at top, the color fades very fast after being washed"
Lots of extra fabric.
"This was too small for my ""20 inch"" bag."
Did not realize it was not a set!
"these sizes are completely awkward, S/M is too small for my head and L/XL is too large, this is a common problem with several people I've talked to, they need to have something in the middle as well."
"Run small.  Even if they fit I don't think they would be comfy.  Very stiff material
With no give at all.  And the toe area is as hard as steel.  Back they go at a whopping $12
At my expense."
"Toe-crunchers :-( Why can't anyone make cute, comfy flats that are wider than a Barbie foot?!?"
Gave one star because  was not allowed zero.
Kind of flimsy.
"I slide around in this shoe.  It does not provide the support that I need.  If I had not thrown out the box at delivery, I would have returned them.  Thr Clark's is a much better fit and support.  My food stays put in them."
"This wallet although it looks bigger in the pic is just to small for anything, everything has to be folded and there are only 2 pockets inside with a tiny slit in the middle which would be a 3rd but it won't even fit a drivers liscense. good quality leather tho."
Returned these - they are plastic-y.  The Vionic company used to be Orthaheel.  Orthaheel made nice quality shoes but Vionic not so much!
"Nice boot.  I really wanted to keep these because I like the look and the construction seems good.  But for me they are way too narrow, even the 2EE.  The toe box was very small and cramped my toes badly. while the heel section was loose.  I went down a half size like recommended by Danner (I called them too).  The Danner person suggested trying the version of this boot without Gor-tex which supposedly runs wider. I didn't do that so I'm not sure if this is true or not.

I sent them back and got a pair of Merrell Wilderness.  Extremely happy!"
Terrible quality. Smells discusting
"I thought these shoes would be so comfortable but they were not.  The provide lots of arch support and cushion at the bottom, but seem to only be useful for someone with small, narrow feet.  This was the second pair I purchased (sized up) and they still didn't fit comfortably."
"I am definitely returning this shirt to Amazon, which is rare for me.

Pros:

1. Fits well.

Cons:

2. The collar stays are not removable, and they are very flexible.

3. It is very hard to button and unbutton the top button (the one on the collar).

4. Very thin material, no insulation value.

5. Despite being called ""fitted"", this shirt is very baggy around my torso."
Horrible. Finish wore off after 1 wear. Don't waste your money.
They looked better than on the picture however I couldn't get my feet in !!! the zipper doesn't give any extra room.
They get worn out quickly.
were sent back...the full rise is ugly
Cheap sox. You get what you pay for.
They are cute but fit a little small and have a strong smell to them. The smell didn't go away in the wash.
"I ordered big kid size 6, instead I received toddler size 6.  When I contacted the company they did not have the correct size.  Very disappointed."
"This took forever to arrive and was way too big for my wrist. It looks pretty, but my nephew took it and wears it around his bicep."
Looks beautiful. Imagine how much more I would love a working version of the watch. The stem has three positions. The middle position is the wind position and it won't wind
I didn't think this shoe was attractive in person and it also pinched my left toe in my size. The support was awful to me because the shoe bottom felt spongy as if it was about to give everytime I moved. Not for me. I returned it for a refund.
"So I am 5'3"" about 180lbs & I ordered a large, they fit snug around the hips, and the pockets did not hold my Samsung galaxy s2 phone with case at all. I know it said Heavy blend yoga but wow super hot. Very soft material,  but not something to wear on a casual day in May in Phoenix."
"Please don't waste your money puchasing this item..claims of a flat belly one week after birth is a bunch of crap..your stomach will go to its normal shape in due time and yes, this is not something you can wear under your clothes to work as it bulges up... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"
The clasp on this broke before I had a chance to wear them.
"I wanted to wear it under my wedding dress, but it didn't provide enough coverage and support. It got sent back."
They were too big. The lights worked on only 1 shoe!!
"Good quality, very sturdy, but also a bit on the heavy side. I guess the lighter they are the flimsier. What I don't like is that the zipper handles are huge and you cannot tug them into a sleeve or anything and I'm very sure that they will not stay on and will get ripped off from the baggage conveyer belts rather sooner then later.
Another things I don't like is the size. This one is simply too big (29 inch model). The next size down is just a bit too small (25 inch) since it's not only smaller in height but all 3 sides are much shorter. Something in between would be the perfect fit, a 27 inch model. But no, they only have too big and then too small.
If you fill this one up it is way over the regular coach class weight limit of 50 pounds. If you fly international business class where 70 pounds are allowed and you actually need to take that much with you then it is ok. I always like to pack more than I need or leave enough space to bring stuff back from Europe but if I fill this one up two thirds then I'm at the 50 pound weight limit. Paying overweight once you hit that threshold is always more expensive than checking in another bag so since bag simply doesn't work for me."
"The hood covers your eyes, way too big not proportionate to the body of the sweatshirt. Can't leave the hood up."
Way too tight at the top.
Shoes were way too wide for my medium width foot
This dress was so cute in the picture online but when we got it we were so disappointed. The dress which was a size smaller because I read other reviews was still WAY too wide for my 8yr old. It was also extremely short which I was mislead to think it would be a long dress by the picture. Overall this is a terrible buy.
"Should have known this wouldn't work based on the ""soft cup"" name. The fit around the band is fine. And if I would ever actually wear it around, it would probably be pretty comfortable. But because my girls aren't the same size (right side smaller), the soft cup get smooshed under your top if you don't fill them up. This makes for a very ugly and not so invisible look.
I hated it, but made the mistake of ripping the tag off the bra.. throwing away.. sigh.. (hate to be wasteful, but I don't think anyone takes bra donations..)
Would probably work and be comfy for more ""even"" ladies. Can't speak for the 4-way adjustable strap.. didn't bother trying this feature out."
It looks like something you would win out of a gum ball machien for a quarter im embarassed to wear it
This shirt was extremely small.  It was nothing like a size medium that my husband usually wears.
The fit was too small compared with other brands.  Very cheap feel to them.  Save your money - buy another brand.
"the size must run small, because normally a 9 would have fit with room to spare but these were tight all around.  Not good for wide feet."
Dull in appearance
very cheap bag
"These are not the Cherokee uniforms from several years ago. The current Cherokee uniforms are not 100% cotton, but rather a blend that is not as breathable as the original uniforms.

Furthermore, the sizing is horrendous. The waist sizes and lengths of the pants are entirely too big for the given size. However, the tops actually fit as they should. The sizing of the tops is the only redeeming quality of this overall ill-fitted and poorly constructed uniform set.

Therefore, I would recommend buying a top in the size you normally wear. For the pants, I recommend going down a size."
"Bottoms fit well but not worth it to just keep those. I think I ordered a 3xl because I wear 36DDD, top is WAY too small. Ugh."
A nice print but I didn''t really like how thin the material was and the sizing was a little small.
too large on arm hole can see your bra on sides! but yeah its okay
"The boot itself is a nice boot.  Unfortunately, I ordered a size 11.5M but received a size 11M.  The box said 11.5M but the boot itself (the label on the tongue) said 11M.  Box was received smashed due to poor packaging."
This item runs about 2 sizes small.  Otherwise very nice.
I'd like to give this item more stars because they fit well but I can't.  The sole on the shoe is slick and slips even on carpet.  I've tried scuffing up the bottom so it will grip a little on surfaces I'm walking on but it didn't make any difference.  It would be a great shoe if the sole was different.
Not a good fit like some branded tees..Looks a lil odd
product was very stiff
"I wanted to love this and I wanted to get each of my daughters one, however, our last name was not centered well under the cheerleader word and that just turned me off to buying more. It was close but its still off enough to bother me. I wish they would have just pressed a new bag and didn't ship it that was it was not a good first time experience. Otherwise its small and perfect for a game day bag and if the personalization was centered it would be a five star for cuteness and a 3.5-4 for quality just because of the zipper"
"This necklace is just barely okay.  No, it's really not okay from what I expected.  I expected from reading reviews and about the designer that it would be spectacular.  I haven't got a single complimentary remark, not even when I asked friends what they thought of my ""fancy new necklace"".  Unfortunately I became ill and was unable to put in for a return in the allotted time.  Luckily I bought it as a deal of the day so the price, though not nearly worth what I paid, could have been 3 times worse!  It definitely looked much, much better on my computer than in real life.  From the descriptions and reviews  about how the pearls and ?? are all hand strung with such care and are so beautiful I really thought I was going to get something very special.  The ""gems"" look like imitations.  The only special thing about the hand knotting that was so highly rated was that it was evenly done between each knot.  The two large clear/white (I'm not sure exactly)beads that are part of the closure are probably the most embarrassing part of this necklace.  My best friend even laughed!  Because I spent about $45 I feel like I need to wear this thing.  I'm still not sure what I'll find to wear it with.  Perhaps if I can get my local bead store to replace that ridiculous closure I could get away with wearing it----sonewhere.  I do know I  will never admit what I paid for it,  I definitely will not brag anymore  about this ""famous pearl jewelry designer"" that made it nor will I mention the part about how fabulous the hand knotting is supposed to be.  I've never been this disappointed with a jewelry purchase from Amazon that was supposedly such a prize."
"Amazon price considerably better than in-store, which is approaching $60 per these days. Inconsistent size makes online ordering foolish.
Order the same size that you've been for years, too big. Familiar choice, at this point, return or look/ feel funny. No matter who pays return
shipping, at this point, many of the appealing features of online shopping have gone away.  Inferior denim material wears out very quickly,
just like the cheaper brands, which you can walk out with an armload of, almost anywhere, this afternoon, scratch the whole task off your
list, for another season or so. I don't mind the made in Mexico, at all. I think healthy trade, commerce with other countries in this hemisphere is a force for the good.
,  They've also taken to using inferior fabric on  front pockets, peculiar, pale, night-vision green thread on back pocket stitching.
Little bit here, little bit there...."
It arrived not working. Disappointed. Returned it.
"Swimwear was not a US Ladies Medium, the bottoms fit the size of a 3T child and the top was so small that no one age appropriate could fasten the top around their chest area. This product was poorly sized for a US Ladies Medium. I can not re-sale this product. I would like a 100% refund."
very poor quality. I'm not an Olympic swimmer or anything but after 1 swimming session at the gym it started falling apart and it began to bleed its color. you get what you pay for I guess. Although Ive found one piece suits in the clearance racks for same price that have lasted wayyy longer than this suit.
Kind of expensive for the quality. And I didn't end up being able to wear it long. The nurses didn't care much for it either. Once you're there in the middle of labor you don't care what you're wearing. Honestly a better option might be a sports bra and short stretchy skirt.
Calf was way too big- looked like pirate boots
"The boots are great quality but when I opened the package I was extremely  dissapointed to find out they are NOT at all the color or texture expected. The Black is NOT as pictured, it was more of a dk grey with a weathered worn/vintage leather finish. IF that is what you like then you're in luck. If you want a flat black color as I did, you will be dissapointed"
"The material was cracking during the wearing, it started  to separated at the arch and appeared to come apart. I cannot wear them again"
It has started to tear just like the old one. It lasted an even shorter period of time.
Yuk.  I guess I didn't notice the hardware is gold before ordering. But I sure couldn't miss it when I opened the package.  It is really shiny and cheap looking. Returned same day I received it
"I purchased these boots for my grandson as part of his Christmas gift. He loved themand so did we, until they tore from the top and down the side. He is 2 1/2 so its not like hes super rough with them. In fact, he hasn't even had the opportunity to wear them that often. We expected a pair of Crocs to last. They fit him nice and were easy to put on & take off. Unfortunately, the quality just isn't there and didn't hold up to light wear & use."
"VERY VERY VERY Short! I do not recommend this for anyone over 5 foot, unless you wanna show everything!"
"I was hoping to like these, but I took everyones advice and ordered half a size up. They are way too wide, and the padding on the sides looks really bulky. I like the Keds much better."
The size chart says S for 6.5 but they're way too small.
I can't recommend.
it was returned. too big
"great looking boots, great service, but, sigh, they just don't fit"
The biggest 8&1/2 I've ever seen . More like a 10. Tried to reorder in a smaller size but the size changed from what I ordered before they shipped so I cancelled the order.  Couldn't believe they suggested I wear two pairs of bulky socks to make them fit.. No arch support at all.  Sure are cute though.  Funny how the fur on top was held together with a safety pin.
"Love this top ! My husband couldn't believe there is a ""keep clam "" trend saying he loves!

This top would have been given and 4 stars IF ... And yes it's a big IF - the print on the shirt was centered and symmetrical. The entire phrase is slightly to the right and IT IS noticeable ! Yikes!! BUMMER"
ran bit smaller than the pic demonstrated
"There is no quality control for the manufacture of these bras. One is painfully too tight, one is somewhat too tight, one is fine. One lets my breasts fall out if I lean forward. Each is somewhat a different size."
The color i chose was black. it came in a really dark denim color... kinda weird. and it is way too small anyways.
"Although I have never worn a size 9 in my life (I'm a solid 8), I ordered based on other reviews. It was still too small!
That, and the fact that they looked cheap, I decided to return them. Beware...the minimum shipping to return with a tracking number was $30 (more than the shoes cost). These are going in the trash."
The elastic in the arm holes is mostly an elastic rope so it pinches at one point.
I could hardly get thempast my ankles
Not the same shirt as the picture and very rude customer service.  Very unhappy
THE MATERIAL IS CHEAPAND IT FEELS LIKE A TABLECLOTH ....IT IS HOT AND BELIEVE ME U WILL SWEAT LIKE HELL AROUND THOSE AREAS WITH THIS CHEAP TABLECLOTH ON
"All started when I've received this pair, but picture showing it was not correct (now it conforms). As I wanted boots exactly to what had been shown, I've claimed wron item delivery and returned for replacement. Replacement had arrived exactly the same as the first time, as you may guess ;) After that shooes had been sent back for refund."
"I'm usually a small, but I'm like hey why not order bigger to wear to bed. So I ordered an extra large and it was too small. It was also way too thin and see through and you can't wash it in water or it deteriorates."
The colar is way too big!
The clip portion of the belt falls off because there is no retention for the portion of the belt that you insert into the buckle.
"It came in a nice box,wrapped with pretty stuff. The shoes looked good and then they lasted a month. The side ripped open just like the last pair we got too.  I don't think they are worth the money."
"Just opened the package and am returning it. The wiring had a short where only 1/3 of the lights worked if you held it perfect. Now, after about 1 minute, none of it works at all. Super disappointed daughter who was waiting for this to arrive for a few days, only to have to return it right away.
Poorly made. DO NOT order if you want one that actually lights up."
"OUCH...OUCH! The post that goes between your toes HURTS A LOT! It is covered with hard, clear, tubular plastic so the leather post is stiff and can hold the decorative button above your toe. Unfortunately, it won't soften, because it isn't leather on the outside. I returned these sandals, even though they are really, really cute! Perhaps if you wrapped some kind of gauze or cloth around the post, it would work. It's not for me...I need comfort!"
One of The woden tie clip came green...like it had mold or something
Kind of look like maternity pants but fit like teenager pants
The leather is beautiful and soft but the fit is too wide and too large.
"I had been brand-loyal to Columbia for shoes for several years, so when my husband needed some sturdy and comfortable shoes this past February, I decided to introduce him as well. At first he liked them but it's only been 5 months and they already have a hole in the uppers. Not a good first impression."
"Such a pretty watch face, but it is a very cheap band (didn't expect much, but thought I could swap it out) and the timepiece doesn't work.  It stopped twice in the first hour.  I will be sending it back. I do not recommend."
"This top runs very small. I'm normally a large in tops, but this is cut extremely narrow. If you have a large-ish chest size way up or look elsewhere.
Not a fan of the material either. It feels a little cheap."
"Returned, smelled terrible."
"This is the first time Doc Martens has disappointed me. When I first put the shoes on and tied the laces, they seemed to fit fine. (They're always a bit stiff at first and need to be broken in.) But then I took a step. The shoe immediately bowed out at the ankle and slipped off the heel. It is impossible to walk in these shoes!"
Were right size order but sized big I guess
"Should be $5-$7 very low quality, feel like it was a poor decision"
dont buy hurt and you have to pay for return shipping
"This was a very cheap product.  I know for the price I should have suspected it, but I was still rather disappointed."
Material was nice but the top was way too big. I ordered an XL and it fits like a 3X. I felt like I was swimming in it.
I have a large chest and this is not flattering for my body type.  The cuts ended up in the wrong places.
"Wrote a nice review when I first got them but after only a few months the so-called leather cracks across the top of the toe where the foot naturally flexes.  They smell vaguely like leather but perhaps they have a new leather spray with which they spray this plastic-like shoe.  Surprised that ""Dockers"" with a good brand attaches it to these junky shoes."
"We received this an a Friday and by Tuesday a section of the bracelet had fallen apart.  My husband is very ""easy"" on jewelry - retired, too, so its worn only socially.  Disappointed with product.  Happy with Amazon for handling promptly and correctly."
"Very ugly neck tie I don,t like it"
"I have purchased these in the past and liked them however they have changed the design.  The leg holes are now much smaller / cut has changed.  Would send them back if I could, they are going in the donation bag."
Perfect sterling silver neckless until you wear for a few days.  Turned and tarnished
Badly made. Extremely small. Would probably fit a baby.
The buckles was messed up. I need to fix it with velcro and not happy about it.not worth the hassle
Did not look like the picture at all. Yeah you get earrings and yes they are flowers. But the picture shows actual beads in the center of the flowers and the petals are more defined in their outline. What I got was a poor cheap imitation.
This product ran a bit too large and looks very cheap.
"Very small not leather, this bag is for child not adult. Amazon should make sure how items are listed so there no problem OH, that right Amazon doesn,t care bout there customer"
Same thing. It's just some styles are really not close to their size.
"As other reviewers noted, the toe bed is exceptionally long.  Even with my monkey toes I don't need that much space! These went back."
"First off they lost my wig in shipping. Not their fault i know. But then once i received it i took it out of the package and it was gorgeous ! However, once on and worn for about five minutes it looked like a BIG RATS NEST. I mean it 12 bucks so i guess you get what you pay for. But wal-mart wigs for Halloween stayed nicer than this one did.. I just ended up tossing it."
This shoe left my foot swollen. I hate this shoe. I can't even work while wearing it.
I read reveiws and most said order up one size. This are Big! Length was stated as 31. But these were thirty three's.  I liked the plain style but they will bunch at your knee if you plan on wearing boots over them. They are an ok pair but not by any means great will keep them for yard work with my rubber boots but not for anything else.
open the box and played music only once and it broke
"I have tall arches and a high instep. Therefore, the top part of the shoe cuts across the top of my foot and hurts. Makes my toes tingle on the right foot. That part of the shoe is too tight for my feet.
I love the footbed and arch support. The heel cup is comfy. If they weren't so stinking right across the top of my foot is keep them!"
Nope. bad fit
This item is described as having a case diameter of 49 mm. The case is  approximately half that big.
"I really wanted to love these tops, but I have to admit I was disappointed and they are all going back.  I will say that I am NOT a plus size, so perhaps they will work better on a plus size woman.  But even as a regular sized woman, when I wear a top like this, I want them to ENTIRELY cover the backside and they do not.  I ordered size Large.  I am 5'3"", a solid 130 lbs, and I don't look overweight at all, but on the shorter side, I like to wear a pretty top like this with leggings, and it didn't cover my rear end.  I can't imagine why the designers stopped this short.  Perhaps with a skirt or other type of pant, it will work.  But they didn't fall where I wanted them to.  I also think for the price, the quality of material should be much better.  For this fabric, I think it should be about $20-25 cheaper, they are no more than a $40 value, maximum!!  Also, while I'm not overweight, I am not a lightweight, skinny girl, but I didn't quite fill out the top, although I couldn't go smaller and maybe that's why you need to truly be full-figured to appreciate these. But I don't think the seems in the corsets, bust area, etc, fell where I would have expected them to.  I could have done a whole lot of altering to make these appear as beautiful as they do in these pictures.  1 reviewer mentioned that the laces untie very easily and this is true!!  I couldn't control the laces just in trying them on - I can't imagine how annoying it would be if I was actually wearing the top!  Very disappointed, they look so pretty - the idea is there, but it doesn't translate in the wearing.  Add a few inches to the length, upgrade the fabric and lacing, tweak the lines within the top, and you probably have a hit.  But not these, not at these prices.  Thankful that Amazon does free shipping both ways on them!!  Would NOT have been happy if I had to pay both ways!"
"Very comfortable.

Update after 1 year.

Taking away all of the stars, awfully uncomfortable sandals. I do not feel any arch support at all."
"Nice cute shoe but way over priced for what you get and why are some colors more costly than another? !?!
I'm sending them straight back."
"This shoe is poorly made. I bought it last year and the bottom tread separated from the body of the shoe, flapping off at the front and making them unwearable after only two months. I gave New Balance another try as they sent me a replacement pair. Now the replacement shoes are separating the same way after a few months, but New Balance now says they will not replace after 30 days, even though the shoes are clearly defective, barely worn but the top separating from the bottom! They lost me a s a customer, and others should beware of this product too."
The color is a bit off and the size is small too.  I typically can just buy Anne Klein dresses without ever trying it on and be confident the dress will fit perfectly.  NOT this one.  the V neck is extremely deep cut and not office appropriate.
"It says slim fit, but it is big size. Not like it all!"
"This a really nice hat, though it needs to be steamed A BIT to get the brim in proper shape.  Good quality; good fit,
BUT!  why did the person(s) who packed it have to destroy the hatband feather in the process?!?!  Now I have to go out and
purchase feathers from another company.  That's BS."
"I have the 8 "" boot & it is very comfortable without the plastic heel insert. I bought this 6 "" boot thinking shorter in the summer would be cooler. Put these on & noticed it was really tight,(have same size in 8 "")worn around house & decided to send them back. Too much cash for a maybe it would break in,rubbed me at the very top of the boot,too much slop."
"These were ok, not very soft and kind of frumpy looking.  I ordered the xxl ( I wear a womens 16 / 18 ) and these were too big.
I would of called these more of a 3x.  I sent them back."
"I was so disappointed when this dress arrived. I ordered it for my granddaughter, who is a size 5. The dress is more of a size 2, though the inside tag says 5. Also the cotton is extremely thin. I learned my lesson about ordering little girl's dresses over the internet. Oh, well, live and learn. My advice is to not buy this dress!"
"What can I say? Well, for $25, they're not bad.... Until you notice that these are knock offs. I had to do some research after receiving these and noticed that these have seven holes rather than 6. The fabric is no where near strong and thick but rather thin and cheap. It seemed too good to be true but hey, I'm only out $25. So, they are now my gym shoes until they fall apart of which I suspect will happen in a few weeks."
"Don't Waste your Money
The strap broke the third time I wore this.  The seller will not exchange this or give me my money back."
too small even though I ordered my normal size.
they seem to suck the socks right off my feet...whatever cushion support inserted in the shoe makes walking awkward
"These were okay I guess. These fall under the clothes that I buy from Amazon that are not as expected. Sometimes I feel companies sell their clothes on Amazon that were not quite made right. I will go to the store and the jeans will fit perfectly, but if I buy off of Amazon they don't. I am 5'6 and they are a little short. I would probably say these pants are more for petite females. Also, the pockets both had holes in them. I find this annoying as I usually keep my keys and phone in my pocket. My keys often fall out of one hole and my phone gets stuck in the other one. Overall, I didn't find these jeans very flattering, a good fit, or well made. I didn't send them back because they are serviceable, but that's the best i can say about them."
"My wife said the optional straps are placed so far over on the sides that wearing them doesn't add much support and is uncomfortable.  She also said that this is sized rather large for an A cup, as she is larger than a standard A but not quite a B and this bra was too big on her.  She is unimpressed."
Way too small for  size  your sizing is not good
"Decided to give it a try, even though I mostly stick to underwire bras. Did not like it, no support and fits irregularly, can't really tell if it's too small or just not a good style for me but I did not like it and wouldn't recommend."
Only gave one star because the color is right but the thing is small and tight as if for a child ! The material is CHEAP ! I mean like worth 50. It's the kind of material that snags and pulls on ANYTHING that isn't perfectly smooth ! I threw it in the trash. Not worth my effort to return
not made for a tall woman.
Very see through runs a little short.
zipper broke right away
Holy marshmallow batman.  This thing turns your small child into ralphies little brother from a Christmas story.  Did not work for us.  Impossible to try to breastfeed in.
I ordered the size I already wear. But apparently this brand and size run very small.
"These were just hideous on me. I was looking for a comfortable, not too dressy, not too casual boot with a slight point, but these just looked terrible on me. Reminded me of space boots. perhaps if worn with tights as 'booties' they might have lookded right..."
I've followed the size chart as listed and had to send the shirt back two times as the shirt was too small . On the third exchange I got the shirt in the right size but the wrong color... I'm just keeping the shirt as I don't want to keep exchanging the item.
Not good. Don't like it.
"I got a size ""small"" and it is WAY too big for my 4 year old. Would probably fit like a 10 or 11 year old."
"Not too happy with Haggar and now Dockers, that state you have to wash and dry these pants inside out.  What a bunch of BS!  When I did wash as instructed, they come out of the dryer with ""reverse pleats"" . . . ugh (even when removed from the dryer promptly!).  Now I wash and dry them ""right side out"" and they are better.  What is the reason for such stupid instructions?"
Price super high for a piece of plastic.
Just all around cheap bag! it ripped in a matter of a week! could not get the answers I was looking for to get money back or a better bag!
Waist band one inch short of requested size and button very difficult to get into hole. The hole is to small for button.
"We have returned the jeans and are waiting for the correct size to be sent.
No idea if they are resending or not, not sure how to even check into that. Amazon does NOT make things EZ that's for sure"
"I just opened these ... and they don't fit well.. I have small feet. Size 7-1/2 mens but these are supposed to be for mens 6- 12. Further either there is extra material at the toe. but they are tight fitting around the foot... Low price, but I wouldnt buy them again  - Made in El Salvador

been wearing these and hour and just downgraded rating to 1 star .. socks are rolling around my feet inside my shoes just walking around the house... Spend a few more bucks and get a quality made USA sock.  Wish I returned these.. won't buy cheap again

Update after z couple hours the excess material at the toe is bunching up under my toes.  Don't eastern your money"
Bought 2 same size different color. The gray is on its way back. Much too small. The peach is very pretty. Ordered 3X for extra room and shrinkage. Definitely is not 3X but will keep and won't put in the dryer.very disappointed!!!
"I bought these for s specific outfit. These did not fit well for me. I ordered the green, they are gorgeous, but I can't wear them. I wore them once and they were just ill-fitting."
If you re 9.5 just get 8.5..... You re 10 ask for 9.5 and it s ok.....
"They rub my feet wrong. I have two other pairs or traditional Toms that are fine, but these cause blisters from rubbing. Stick to the regular canvas ones."
These were marked XXL when in fact were XL. It took two emails and two phone calls to get a return merchandise label. Refund requested. Quality wasn't good. Would not buy these again.
Horrible. Broke as soon as I opened the package.
"just ok, but look cheap"
dont know how to explain it
"2 stars because it arrived sooner than expected. Fits as expected. Image very distorted and blurred, the smaller white text is illegible."
Doesn't look or fit like boy shorts...looks and fits like regular underwear.
"I got the super-wide 4E's and expected the usual cavernous toe box but got quite a narrow, big-toe-pinching experience instead.

Ever since hiking the Appalachian Trail in 804s years ago I've purchased NB 4E shoes specifically so my toes can breathe and not rub.

This is the first pair I've been disappointed in."
Very small not as described
"I got this skirt as a knock around but the fit is shapeless as it just hangs. This is a ""you get what you pay for item!"""
"Nice, BUT, the toe leather is too tight and rubbed blisters on both big toes during the first wearings. These should soften up though and overall I like the shoes."
Cute but wasn't true to size.
This shirt is at least 2 sizes too small and the picture is small and off center. It looks nothing like the picture.
Real poor quality for being super soft. I sent them back for a refund.
"I thought this was a good idea but didn't like the look and I wore them once and they cut my toes across 3 of them
I returned the 2 pair I bought
the nylon itself was a great finish and color- loved that
but I couldn't get them to not cut and bloody my toes:("
Very dull looking. Looks white paste.
"I don't like these slacks.  I usually wear a 34"" or 36"" waist size, and these (36"" waist) were extremely (uncomfortably) small.  I've worn them once, and don't ever expect to wear them again."
"Not water proof  or life proof ! All the crystals fell off ! A real shame, it was so pretty when I recieved it!"
"Do not waste you money!!!!! Based on size guidelines from seller I bought 2 med in different colors, the sizes are not accurate! THESE ARE CHILDRENSWEAR NOT WOMENSWEAR!
Unfortunately being severely ill, unable to return, one never opened, the immediately resealed and trying on, do NOT TRUST!"
"The material is way too thin as other reviews have stated.
The first time around, just taking it out of the wrapping, it had holes in it. I reported it to the sellers and they promptly replied back, sending me a prepaid label and I sent it back. The second one I received looked alright, until further inspection I found that the one of the inner pockets had a big hole in it, and my mother discovered a small hole forming on the top near the shoulder hem.
Definitely not worth buying. Material way too think to last long. I never even got to wear it. I'm not sure what I'll do with it. My mother sewed the pocket up, but I'm too scared to wear it in fear of it just completely falling apart at the seams."
"I was really surprised that JS boots were so poorly fitting. I am often called chicken legs and still these boots would not zip over the calf. The proportion was off. They fit large in the foot (I tried size 6). Also, the insole is not cushiony or comfortable. They look nice on the outside but unless you're displaying them, they are awful. I returned them and bought a different kind."
Really small. Have ordered others in same style and the sizing was fine. The waist on these are tiny.
"If it ships from Pink Shop it's a FAKE!!! I have a genuine Columbia PFG long sleeve and let me tell you this is a total rip off. I've added a pic of my genuine PFG, the lighter blue shirt. Proof positive. Buyer beware of Pink Shop."
Fit is very smallm
"I ordered three of these bras because of the great reviews. Unfortunately, after I ordered them, I was reading more reviews and noticed someone mentioned how itchy this bra is. I flashbacked to a bra I had previously ordered, wore once, and threw away because of the same problem. I realized the bras I ordered were from the same company, Just My Size. Sure enough, the one I tried on itched. The itchiness seems to be in the seams. I'm wondering if it's the thread they use. Anyways, this time I returned them for a refund. I'll remember to stay away from JMS bras. You get what you pay for."
One pair snagged coming out of the package.
To small even tho I ordered the same size as I always have in other crocs. Wanted to return but would have had to pay shipping at $15. Forget that! I gave them to a friend.
"The dress has a very cheap quality look to it, but you get what you pay for."
"These shoes fit ... uh, weird.  Instead of a consistently tapering shape, they seem to bulge out oddly at various points (e.g. where design sections meet), making the foot appear misshapen.  And the stitching comes through to the inside, serving as an irritant to the foot.  It's just not attractive or comfortable on the foot."
"Clasp broke after a couple of weeks. Really too large to fit into a front pocket, and would be uncomfortable in the back."
"Greatly anticipated getting this set in and was so pleased when I opened everything up I put everything on immediately.

Well I wish I would've looked a little closer at the earrings because the clasps for the studs were entirely too loose. So loose that one earring fell out within a few minutes as I was walking my dog. Alas- five minutes in and my set is already incomplete."
Never worked right. the tech support was chinese and did not do a good job of helping out with programmimg. Quality was poor.
"Ordered a size 10 - YIKES! They fit nicely when I first put them on. By the end of the day, they were so badly stretched out that they were down to my mid-thigh, and at the same time coming out the top of my waistband. I would estimate they stretched out 2-3 times their original size.
Maybe when I run them through the dryer they will shrink down and fit better. Report back later.

Update: they are still unwearable. Soon to be thrown in the trash."
Waist size was wrong.  Ordered a size 40 but actual size was 38 or less.
you look like a bumble bee in these... expectation vs. reality were quite different. Did not like them
it's ok. i wish i had paid attention to the fact there are no front wheels. by the time i realized it for the first [and only] trip i took it on it was too late to exchange. bummed since it took me a while to save up for this specific brand and now it's not what i was hoping for. but love the brand! have a large suitcase and backpack of same brand. great product if it was what i wanted :)
Don't know what happened to Carhartt quality but very disappointed with these jeans.
"Not happy with the quality of the material.  It is not a true 4T, plus the size states age 4 and I ordered a 4T"
"Beautiful dress but the way too long, I had my husband stand up with it and he's 5'11 it went past his feet. I'm a 36D so I ordered 2 sizes up it didn't fit around by bust area at all definitely wouldn't close. Tried to get it fixed but no none with touch it. Waste of $96 can't wear it and the military ball is or his weekend. Super depressed it looks nice but I can't wear it"
"Seriously, where do they get these sizes from. Waaaaaayyyyy too small"
"I normally wear a size 8.5W-9W but with this shoe I could have sized down to an 8W.  Don't get me wrong it is a nice shoe but just runs large.  They do have the standard Clarks quality (good material, stitching, heel height) in a loafer."
"I don't know who fell asleep at the sizing wheel, but these large underwear wouldn't fit on my neighbors 7 year old let alone my 13 year old, who matches the sizing chart for this size. They're also very looong in the crotch. Very strange. I suppose when you opt for the cheapest underwear you can find, you get what you pay for. Though, I've not had this problem with Fruit of the Loom, to be honest..."
It's great if you don't have testicles or a dick.
Smaller than I thought and not crazy about the white straps.
"I was super excited about these shoes for my daughter, especially since I was able to find them for nearly half the price. They are a pain to put on and get off though! They always come untied. My one year old does not have the patience for me to tie and constantly retie. The laces are super long as well. I bought something to cinch the laces so I wouldn't necessarily have to tie them, but the shoes came right off. I would've tried shortening the laces if I thought it was worth it, but after a few weeks of really wanting these to work I bought a used pair of velcro shoes. So much easier to get on and off! I was reluctant at first, because I thought my daughter would immediately take them off, but they don't get taken off nearly as much as the lace up New Balances."
"Love it. Not to big, not too small. Perfect size, very lightweight.good price. Update: two weeks later the earrings are black."
"Unable to fit dress. It is not flattering on a slim build small frame bust and/or hips female. Wasted of money. Would not buy again. The material is nice,but I will never wear the dress"
"I received this several months ago & was giving myself time to wear it to determine just how much I liked it, but that would mean I'd have to wear it to be able to determine that. The ring runs small, so while it does fit, it fits a little tight & quite uncomfortably. The design is small, so unless you're actually looking at it up close, it's hard to actually see that it's turtles.  The flippers/feet of the turtles along with their heads are slightly bent inward,  at least on the one I received, & make the ring press into my finger all the way around. The ring is shiny & bright, however. I would have returned it just for the fact that it runs small, but now too much time as passed & I can't. Maybe I'll give it to my niece for her upcoming birthday..."
"First, let me start by making it clear that I did NOT purchase my Coobie Bras from Amazon, I purchased them directly from the Coobie Website, but am posting my reviews on Amazon because the Coobie website does not allow real reviews and only has ""positive testimonials"" and I cannot voice my displeasure there.  I'm attaching a photo/screenshot of my proof-of-purchase so that anyone reading this review understands that I actually purchased these items elsewhere and am not a fake reviewer nor a competitor trying to bring down the ratings dishonestly.  Please see the attached photo for proof of my purchase from the Coobie Website.

That being said, this is the most disappointing purchase in bras that I've ever made.  I don't have any medical issues like recovering from surgery or anything like that, so I am reviewing as a regular woman who owns a huge variety of bras varying from underwire, push up bras to basic, cheapo sport's bras to fun ""bralettes"".  And these are the WORST bras I've purchased even for the fairly low pricing.  I am a 36 C and am about a size 8.  I'm 5'7 and have some hormonal issues that lead to regular bras being a bit too painful for ""at home"" or ""grocery store"" or even ""casual"" wear.  I normally buy the Victoria's Secret ""Lounge Bra"" that has no clips, no adjustable straps, but DOES have padding and a ""push up"" style with no underwire.  They are long line bras meant for wearing at home....but because I find all bras painful, I wear them exclusively even for dressing up and work attire and they are both comfortable and flattering to your chest.  But they are also expensive, so I decided to give Coobie a try because around the house and running out to the store....I never wear anything but bralettes or basic sport's bras from target or Kohl's.

My main issue is that these are *allegedly* made for comfort, easy sizing, soft material, and wearability.  I found nothing but ""soft material"" to be true of these bras.  I ordered this style (the original Coobie) as well as the v-neck with the tighter band and also purchased a ""one size"" T-Back tank top.  I don't expect a sporty bra like this to make my chest look the way a regular bra would.  I realize it's going to basically hold the up a little and provide comfortable coverage.  That was my only expectation.  And both styles I ordered totally failed on that.

The straps are adjustable, but super thin.  They are really small compared to the bulky style of bra.  And in order to gain some ""lift"" by adjusting the straps ....you end up with the bottom band pulling up too easily over your ""under bust"" rather than staying firm and just pulling up the cups.  The material IS very soft.  But the pads are removable and the typical cheap ""triangle"" that you have to shift around and still looks weirdly unnatural rather than a dedicated ""cup"" that is padded and stays in place.  The biggest problem I had is that somehow this (and the other style bra I ordered) make my chest look 10x WORSE than if I had on no bra at all or wore a standard ""uniboob"" sports bra that isn't supposed to look decent.  For it to make my chest this unflattering even under basic tanks and around the house, I expect it to AT LEAST be really tight and supportive.  It's not.  Everything slides around.  The bottom band isn't tight and pulls up....the straps are skinny and have no ability to lift or hold, and the finished result is a chest that looks saggy even if your chest normally DOES NOT look saggy going braless.  There are no redeeming qualities to this bra even for workouts (not enough support) or even for sitting around the house (looks bad, rides up) even when I take price into consideration.  I purchased this original style for $20 and then purchased the *allegedly* more ""style"" version for $22 and both are terrible.  Equally unflattering, equally unsupportive, and even for a ""C"" cup....you are truly better off wearing no bra at all if you had hoped for comfortable, flattering coverage.

I think it's safe to say that ""one size"" is ridiculous because the bottom band on ANY bra is really important and this band is basically useless and just there for show.  I'm currently going through the complicated, 4 week return process on the actual Coobie Webstore and would at least advise that if you feel you MUST try these yourself.....buy them on Amazon so that your returns are fast and easy.  I would not recommend these to any woman regardless of bra size or normal expectations for wearability.  Just awful.  Truly."
"very cheaply made, you could see glue from where they used a glue gun to glue the band across the brim"
"I ordered a ladies size 7, my email says ladies, but I got mens so they are too big."
The material for this feels super cheap. It's like a rayon that has this weird sheen. The fit was a bit large but that wasn't the worst part.. it's the thin material. I think you could see see any undergarment you wear under it and it makes a very loud swoosh sound when you move around in it. Looks like the wrinkles are impossible to remove too... Totally returning it.
These didn't fit on any of my daughter's screw back earrings.
post broke off the day I got them
"Cute if you're just wanting a ""crib shoe"", but in my opinion, not for a walker."
"It's even prettier in person nut the battery was dead in arrival
."
"My sole purpose in buying this item was due to it being described as ""longer length"" or ""stays tucked in"".  I wanted something to wear to bed that was comfortable and having a longer length is important to me.  Compared to other t-shirts I've purchased, this item might be (at the most) 1 inch longer, but not enough to make a difference.  Even saying it is longer at all is a bit of a stretch.  I also bought a larger size than I would normally wear and this made no difference."
These are not authentic Lucky Brand jeans. I sent the pair back.
Didn't care for it once I tried it on. Too much material for my small form.
"I am a solid size 11 in every shoe that I own, including boots.  These shoes are easily a size too small.  They could be a 1/2 size too small but all I know is that I got a size 11 and my big toe presses hard right up to the front with thin socks. They are not comfortable to wear for any amount of time but I just kept them because I got a good deal and take the pain sometimes.  They are just work shoes."
"Did not pick up signal. Hard to adjust.  I wound up returning it.  Normally love Casio, this one though was a disappointment."
I returned.  A little tight.
The bra itself is nice but way to small for me 38b.  Very tight.
"UPDATE: JANUARY, 11,2014

I've worn and recommended these once great shoes, for 9 years now. No longer. The quality has deteriorated the past year. They no longer support the ankle or foot, as they once did. The price was raised and the quality was sacrificed. I have to look for another  brand of shoe, that can even come close to how these shoes used to be. What a sad demise of a once great, superior shoe, of which I have tried the best, in brands. If I stayed with this shoe, I would have to buy a new pair every month or two. That is how long they are effectively supportive.

Nothing has changed with my foot or weight or life. It is the shoe, that has changed. I am woefully disappointed."
"cheap cheap cheap This would make a good prop for seeing at a distance (like for stage prop). Not good for streetwear, unless, of course,  you are homeless."
I am disappointed because The reviews fooled me and I am an online shopper.  Firstly  the pic is not the shape of the sweater. Secondly the one I  got seems like it was worn. The material is cheap  material that has little ball and it is not lined inside so if you  buy black be prepared to wear only and old black blouse.  Definitely not worth the money.  I bought nice warm sweater for $9. 99 and  seriously it's way  better quality neatly lined and I can  wear any color top under without my clothes messing up. I will return this crap. Worst buy since I  have been shopping on line and believe me I  buy almost everything on line. Don't be tricked
Love these shoes but they broke while my daughter was trying them on. Disappointing.
"This jacket runs very (and I mean) very small.  I normally wear  XXL in Condor wear, and shocked when the XXXL was way too small.  Maybe the wrong size tag sewn on?  Nice jacket but had to return it."
"I'm 6'2"", and have been buying Hanes t-shirts for 15+ years. They used to stock them at Walmart and Target, but that hasn't been the case for many years now. It is so difficult to find true ""Tall"" sizes. When I find them though, I buy a bunch so that they can last me a long time. My current set is in need of replacement, so I was hoping these would fit the bill, despite being on the pricey side. So I bought one set to try. Sadly, they do not fit.

I took them out of the packaging (which did say ""Tall"" on it), and compared them to my existing shirts that are known to be tall. They were about half to one inch shorter than my true tall shirts. Mind you, this was pre-wash. After being washed one time, they lost several inches, and I can barely tuck them in.

Note: While the packaging said ""Tall"" on it, the tags on the t-shirt did not. They just said XL. My previous true tall shirts would say XL Tall on the shirt tag."
This item breaks very easily
says fit as expected and they were way too small
"look like have been used
very old and not worth the money
big disappointed from the brand
could not return it
left it in the box"
"Sadly, I agree with the other two reviewers.  I wish I would've read their reviews PRIOR to ordering because I got the shoes and was all giddy with excitement to wear them and then couldn't get them on because they're cut for extremely narrow feet.  I was going to reorder/go up half a size, but changed my mind and just decided to find another shoe.  This saddens me because I was excited about all the colors available and was going to make this my shoe of the summer...massive FAIL!"
"Too large. I ordered a large it looks like it's XXL. If u going to order, order 2 size down ur regular size"
"I've definitely had better quality shirts from Amazon. This tee is a fitted v-neck. The neck is modest and not too low. The fabric the shirt is made out of is some sort of cotton, synthetic blend and is very thin. It's soft, but not super soft. I've had shirts made of this type of fabric before, and despite my kind handling (hand wash, hang dry), it eventually developed holes. The shirt is long-ish (It hits at my hipbone. I'm 5'9""), and very form fitting. Although the body of the shirt fits alright, the cap sleeves tend to ride up a little and pinch (I have thin arms). If you order, go a size up for form fitting, two sizes if you want the shirt to be more roomy. I'm not extraordinarily pleased with this purchase, but it would cost more to send back than just keep the shirt. If you're looking for a so-so quality item, one that won't withstand hard wear and one that you don't necessarily want to last a long time, go ahead and give this shirt a try."
Not impressed. I returned it.
Had to  it away!
"the bracelet looks wonderful, just like the picture but the clip spoiled it, it kept falling off and eventually within 2 day I had lost it. Very disappointed!"
"I had to return it because as soon as I opened the package, the snap, used to extend the organizer, broke off. The other snaps seemed fine though, so I think I just got a defective one. I returned and reorder and will update this as soon as the new one comes in. I love the idea though, I have always had problems switching purses forgetting stuff in different purses, etc. I am hoping this brand isn't a dud, or else I'll jest go with a different brand. I just chose this one because of the good reviews."
I always wear a size 6 in a Vanity Fair panty.  These were so small I gave them away then ordered Vanity Fair Women's Body Caress Hi Cut #13137 and they fit as expected.  Nice panty if they had fit.
"I was excited about this bra based on the reviews. However, it didn't work well for me. It was very soft and comfortable, I actually liked the front clasp and the back without the clasp. But the adjustment hardware on the straps were thick and made a creaking noise with minimal movement. The cups also put my boobs way way off to the sides, when that isn't where they actually sit. I'll be returning."
Gave to my sister she like it
i think this bracelet didn't fit my wrist well because it is made very small and i do have a small wrist
So pretty but the shoe was too large and the toe strap too small (I have normal sized feet & no problem with other heels with similar style).
"Great color but it was way too heavy for a nylon bag.  Gave it to Goodwill - tried to use and like it but it just didn't work for me.  Prefer something simpler and lighter - gold hardware was a bit gaudy, too."
"I bought this item for my granddaughter's Christmas present, and she loved sticking the gems to the box. She spent the entire holiday from school on this little project--and that's why I didn't give it only one star. It kept her busy. However...the decorations didn't stick for very long, and now she has a box with about two-thirds of the stickers missing. I wouldn't buy it for her again."
"The material around the underwire is too thick and the DD cup size is not a true DD:(.

I plan to return and keep looking."
Returned. Wife took one look at pants and made me return them. Cheap polyester appearance. Exchanging for more linen appearance.
"Whereas it seems to have plenty of room side to side, it's far too short for me. Unless you are around 5 feet tall, will not fit as pictured."
"Not what I was hoping for, doesn't live up to it's reviews."
"Cute great price but definitely cheaply made and not worth the  ""list"" price. If I had paid that they would be going back. I'm sure my daughter will break soon enough"
smells HORRIBLE
"The boots are very stiff and uncomfortable.  I find Cole Haan shoes and boots very inflexible, although their styling is above average.  I had to return these boots because they were too tight."
NO receipt in the box and I need to send them back. shoes are great in the correct size.
"I ordered this watch.  I thought it looked very good in the picture and liked the description.  When it arrived there were two loose screws rattling around inside.  Easy to see since it is a skeleton watch.  I told amazon and their fantastic customer service overnighted me a new one.  At first I thought the new one looked and ran well.  It even seemed to keep fantastic time for a mechanical watch.  Then about 2 days later I realized that the hands didn't align correctly.  The hour hand only points at a number when the minute hand is at half past.  Almost as if whoever put it together was holding it upside down.  Amazon again agreed to pay for its return but this time offered to give me a refund instead of replaced.  Amazon also said they would pass the issue to the manufacturer.

I am kind of disappointed because it did look nice and did seem to keep good time.

So... I didn't know much about this brand before, but I am done.  I advise any one against buying it.  Would never recommend to a friend."
"Watch buttons stopped working a few weeks after I got it. There was no real apparent reason why. So now it's just stuck on the main screen which makes the extra features useless. Also, when DST kicks in the watch will not be able to be adjusted to the correct time."
"I was excited about the yellow option (not exactly a common color) but sadly it's going back. I was hoping for a nice mustard color, but the bottom looks like cheese from a can."
Cheep plastic looking material. Fabric on inside is wierd cheep feeling. Had trouble with the zippers and it go delayed more than once shipping.
The shoe itself is very comfortable and stylish.  Unfortunately after receiving them for Christmas they are already coming apart on the bottom of one of the shoes where the rubber along the side meets the sole.  I don't even wear these every day.  That's completely unacceptable for any shoe.  Definitely returning these.
"The thong on these sandals is not smooth enough and the seams are rough. Wearing these shoes is PAINFUL. I returned them. Too bad, too, because I loved the look of them."
Returning because the side zipper is too tight.
Pure crap... The order was incomplete.
WILL NOT BUY AGAIN
Terribly ugly. Not at all as pictured.
"Sorry the same day I received it the little arms broke off, I didn't sent it back I felt like it wasn't worth it."
I bought this for my husband and the color is just not the red I was expecting. It has a slight orange tone to it.
"So very dissappointed. The boxer briefs I have ordered several times but with skinny jeans aon wanted to try regular style. Got them, washed in cold and partially dryed in dryer thenhung to dry. They shrinked so much they are no longer a size 8.

Not keen onbuyingthis brand anymore."
Wife wore it once.. what a waste of money
"Ordered a 5-6 size as a gift. However, they were to small and had to return them. I myself wear a size 4 and tried them on. I found them difficult to walk in. The sole is not flat  making it hard to walk in. Slippers soles should be flat  not have a small narrow heel. Never saw a  picture of the sole.. I wouldn't of purchased if a sole picture was available."
Thought it was going to be larger looking at the picture but it ended up being really small. My fault for not looking at the size dimensions.. and when I try to zip it up it seems to always get caught on the seams and won't zip...
Too tight ... the jeans version fits like I want them to ... going to return Sweatpants
"came defective, the buttons were all messed up, also to small as far as not long enough for my tall body."
It doesn't so much stay on the head as it isn't deep enough.
"First order, watch didn't work, it would not play music. Re-ordered, watch didn't work, it would chirp when pressing the music button. It was only $10, but at this point I would not have paid $5."
"These are really cheaply made.  The labels that are ""printed"" on the back on the inside make it feel like you have sandpaper rubbing on you.  I went back to Hanes."
The product does not fit. Typically in maternity the normal nonmaternity size works just fine; But this product was just too small. Too lazy to return too so have to figure what to do.
I ordered a padded halter top with scrunched bottom. I received a bikini NOT FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION AT ALL. It was a piece of cloth cut into triangles with a completely different bottom. No refunds allowed.
This item was larger than I expected and the material was uncomfortable on my skin. The neck line was far too low for my job as a teacher.
"These would be knee high on a 10 year old, but for my average size they come up about 3 inches from my knee and don't stay up after a few wears."
"Oh boy, this are the smallest earrings ever, maybe for a baby girl but not for me.
I had to re order a bigger size."
"Gold plate has the word 'Vionic' NOT just the decorative ""V"" that is shown in the description. This is not the product I thought I was getting and I am returning them."
"I initially thought this top was good quality and even order another one in different color (so I purchased pink and black). The fabric didn't feel flimsy or too think like some tank tops. However after just a few wash, the initial quality felt did not maintain and made a lot of lints. It was annoying how the pink tank made dark lints and the black tank made white lints. I scrapped them off but the more they are washed, the more lints made on the surface of the fabric. It's really annoying but I still wear them at home and wouldn't wear to go outside. Oh and the fabric doesn't seem to be absorbing much sweat. You know how hot and sweaty it can get when you are nursing especially infant or newborn baby."
Runs way too small. I wish I had known this when ordering i would've just ordered a size bigger and I think I could've liked these pants they seem really comfortable.
"This pair came with defect on a luster. I tried nto like it anyway, it was not in immediate view, but somehow I could not handle it and had to return. Besides, it looked a little weird to me - such kind of shape on this kind of size."
Low quality and the embroidery was very heavy and stiff.
the top one is to big
The face part of the larger bag was sewn on crooked. It gives this bag the appearance of missing a wheel on one side. I returned it with no issues and exchanged it for the Mulpink Dots. Had no Issues with that one. Great travel bag for kids.
I read the descriptions and knew to get a size larger.  It was still snug and had some weird extra fabric going on down by the band- maybe it's because I don't fill it out.
This shoe had a gap between the pad and the end of the shoe. Made it uncomfortable.
"They were so cute and comfortable at first, but it's only been a few weeks of casual wear and they literally are falling apart! Save your money and buy something sturdy like ACORN slippers or UGGs. My last pair of ACORNs lasted 2 years."
"I received these yesterday and I am debating on wether I should keep them or not. They look sort of cheap and the inner ankle part of the shoe sticks out. Because they were only $12.00 with shipping I am thinking I will just keep them and wear them with pants to hide that weird part of the sandal. Would I recommend... NO, invest in a better quality shoe. You get what you pay for so with that being said spend a little more on a pair of nice leather sandals.

I went with the reviews that they were nice and comfortable.... and they are not!! Even the foot bed of the sandal in narrow it almost feel like my feet will touch the floor and I have narrow feet so... I don't know. Also, I think what made the sandals look awful was the way they shipped them out. I purchased these also in yellow and 2 pairs of the gladiator ones and they threw all 4 pair in a small fed ex package so they were all squished down and mashed together. 4 pair of cheap sandals in a 8x12 envelope. Give me a break!!"
"I did not like these glasses at all. The main thing I didn't like was the AO printed on the lens. The glasses were too big for me too. I am female. Lastly, I did not like that I paid $56 for these glasses and just days later the price was lowered to $12 by the same seller. Makes me feel like I was getting taken by paying over $50. I returned them. Ray Bans are much better!"
"This product is very very cheap in that the hair constantly falls out every and the band that holds the ear is noticeable and like that of a party hat. I will make this do but I'm cutting the string off and just hot gluing some hair pins into it, that string is very annoying."
"I was a bit disappointed, the slots for cards are really tight, and the one for ID card does not have a way you can slide it out we were asked for a retailer to give your driver's license. There is a little flap inside it that traps the ID and makes it even harder to get out. I've had to dig a little hole in my plastic window so that I can easily remove my drivers license if I'm asked for it.  I would have sent it back, but I had already tossed out my other zippered check case. However,  not to be a total whiner - the quality of the leather is nice."
"waaay too short on 5'3"" barely hit mt waist"
I've been trying to return it
"This cap is cute, but a little large. Sadly, this was not made  for smaller women. The only other option is to buy children's, but the color selection is somewhat juvenile for an adult. Sits on mom head a little lopsided, average quality and for the most part keeps her head warm. But due to the ill fitting form, it can not perform to it full ability."
"I thought they were nice until I put them on!  The waist was a little loose but the biggest issue was that they  sat REALLY low on my hips and there is no way I can wear them. They are stretchy, not jeans, more like jeggins.. The length would have been ok when wearing with boots which is fine. My legs are short and it is a given I always have to shorten any pants I buy."
"I ordered these is I put straps vertically around by suitcase as well as horizontally. I had missed placed my great ones made by Sampson night and can no longer find them on the market anymore so I took a chance with these wrap them around tighten them up before I had the second one even attached the first one had already loosened , by the time I tightened the second one the first one has loosened by the time I tightened the first won the second one had loosened they just are not worth the money it was a waste of time"
even after washed these underwear were really stiff and scratchy
"was vevy nice but WAY too small,,,"
Looks as shown but very cheap. The zipper broke the first time it was tried on. I am returning it.
although I love the look of the shoe. The quality is very poor.
"Very warm but also scratchy, I do wish Hanes still made 100% cotton thermals.  Plastic in items like these (well, in any clothing frankly) is so dang itchy."
Big hole on the side of pants. Didn't see it until tags had been cut off. Waste of money.
"Way too small. I usualy take a size 10.5. After looking at the reviews I ordered sze 11. Still too small so I returned and
ordered size 11.5. Still too small. Will be returning and trying something different."
"I wore these for an hour and had to take them off.  On one side, the back of the boot developed a crease that would stab at the back of my leg as I walked, and I couldn't wear them again.  Total waste of money."
"Awful! There's a huge seam running down the front and back. The ruffles are a see through silk and not the same color as the rest of the shirt. A bought a large and it fit true to size, I'm 5'4 and 170 lbs"
sucks. doesn't do a thing and i tried it on several different items. might as well light your money on fire cause same result.
Hat is tiny.  The rise in the Shorts were too small
The cuff pattern is entirely different than what the pictures look like! It's more of a blue thick plaid than what you see in the photos. Not what we wanted at all so the product was returned
"This is not ""eco-friendly"" as the seller falsely claims. ""Bamboo Viscose"" is not an eco-friendly fabric."
"Some of us need disposeable pants, but not this disposeable.

$50 Lightweight polyester no-iron pants have their place.  I wear them on the factory floor where rubbing up on the wrong thing will scrap a pair of pants PDQ.  I lose 3-4 pairs per year to this kind of mild inattention so $50 microfiber pants have an appeal.  These however, don't. The back creases are incomplete, the front ones nearly diagonal, and the fly button nearly came off in the wash.  These are pretty bad."
I has to return them.
"Stiff, scratchy material. Returned."
"A lesson to check your packages as soon as they come. It got delivered while I was sick and I didn't open it for weeks. When I did I discovered they were very tarnished! The one on the right in the pic is the one I polished myself, the left is how they came to me.

The size is exactly what I wanted, but very disappointed in the quality of the product. I will keep them and clean them up myself, just won't buy from them again."
"Not silver, not even well plated silver. Bent, tarnished, and turned finger green within 2 hours of wearing it."
"I have now had this purse for 2 weeks now, Purchased Sept 29, today is Oct 14th.  Already I have had a zipper tab break, stitching coming loose from the inner pocket, and just yesterday one of the large round cylinders came loose.

I contacted the seller, who ignored my request to replace it

Grant it, this purse is cute and I got a lot of compliments, at first.  I don't think there will be any compliments on a broken purse.

**I did receive this bag in exchange for my honest review, ** but it's not even worth the discount if I can't use it"
"Made well but uncomfortable under the arms. They all are due to my frame of 5'1"""
Scratchy.  I don't wear them unless I'm running in really cold weather
I received two different shoes. They were two different colors.
Waaaay too small.  I am usually a 32 or 34.  Could not even get the 34's on.  Had to throw them out.
"Okay, new rating. I brouhht these for my husband and son. Purchased a medium for my 9 year old and it was really long on him. After one was it was like infant size"
size is not quite accurate..but seller refunded right away
I must've gotten a bad batch.  Almost all of the underwear purchased has holes in them after one wash.
"Let me just say - who wrote positive reviews for this shirt? Have you not seen good quality t-shirts? They look nothing like this one!

My teen son can always use extra cool t-shirts (adding up to my bill.. lol), so I was happy to get this one at discount in exchange for honest and unbiased opinion.

Strangely I have also purchased and reviewed a similar t-shirt for the same seller. Well... Quality is not there at all.

CONs:
- COLOR. Faded. Not bright as it's show on the pictures.

- SIZE. I am aware that sometimes Japanese/Chinese sizes run 1-2 sizes small. So I ordered XL size for my son who wears M (Medium). Well, this XL t-shirt was small for him. Looks like US size S. Comparing to the similar shirt I've ordered (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatton-Men-s-3D-Print-Wild-Wolf-T-shirt-XL-Black/dp/B01GCM08OM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatton Men's 3D Print Wild Wolf T-shirt XL Black</a>) - I am thinking it's a weird production of weird t-shirt, where nobody cares or checks what size tags they put on t-shirts. No seriously - I am not kidding. How the same company has 2 t-shirts with the same size XL, but one feels like L and the other like S ???

- MATERIAL. Well, at least this t-shirt has a tag inside showing material - POLYESTER. Why posting Cotton for both t-shirts? I would never by Polyester t-shirts for my son. When trying it, my son immediately asked it to be taken off. And advice of professional dry cleaning.. seriously? :)

- MADE. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Uneven in some places. Bad stitches. No price/brand tags attached to t-shirt (which usually happens to other normal clothing..lol)

- PRICE. Hmm.. $14.99 for this?? Maybe $5...

PROs:
- The only one is that it's a cool design overall. My son would've like to wear it, if everything else was good."
"This sports bra gives absolutely no support. I ran in it once and will never wear it again. Even when I tried it on just to wear around the house it feels like I might as well wear nothing. I'm a 32D and the band around the bottom fit and the fabric was snug so I know it's not the wrong size, it just doesn't stop any movement at all."
It looks better but I expected more quality.... not satisfied.
too small.  tossed into trash
There ok but after awhile they started hurting my feet
"I like the bra but felt it was too small even though I'm a 36A.  The elastic band seemed too tight for me.  I returned, no problem, and ordered the Plus size which was much more comfortable."
"What a surprise!  I have purchased Alegria Shoes for years and found them to always be dependable in size and quality.  This pair had to go right back.  They were small, tight, and seemed to have some sort of defect along the right side.  I was so disappointed, but because of my long history with this brand, I will most likely buy the brand again.  Perhaps what I received was a fluke!"
"This sweater is very loosely knit.  As a result, my 14yo daughter had worn a hole in the back pretty quickly.  It looks good out of the box, but after about a week of wearing she had an obvious hole in the knitting in the back.  She would not buy another one."
"Poorly designed & uncomfortable, wouldn't recommend"
"I bought these in a women's 7.5. I'm not sure what it is about these shoes but I'm constantly tripping. They're lightweight, so it's not because my feet are being weighed down. They fit, so I'm not tripping because of the size. I don't know what it is that's making me trip EVERY SINGLE DAY MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. It's annoying and embarrassing. These are my work shoes and I'm definitely getting rid of these once I can get to a store to buy something different. I hate these shoes. Also the tread sucks and you can easily slip on slippery surfaces."
I did not like the twisted shoulder. It was too large to fit properly.
"Wow, these are not the same shoes I bought at Famous Footwear. They must be knock offs because they don't fit well and rub my feet and cause blisters. I would not recommend buying from this seller. I bought the same pair of shoes from famous footwear more than a year ago and they felt great. These are awful and I can't return them because they are beyond the 30 day return policy. I am not pleased with this purchase. Perhaps, they changed the style of the shoe in the past year. If this happens to you, please return them within in 30 days."
was to small  even using the size  guide
"I ordered an XXXL, and the bag said it was an XXXL, but the tag in the actual garment was labeled XXL, and they were too small. I did try them on, because depending on the cut, sometimes I can wear an XXL, but not in these, the rise was too low."
Nice product. Very difficult to assemble. Instructions could use improving a great deal. Very difficult for children to assemble. Would not recommend this if there is no adult to assemble for you.
Fine except two belt loops have fallen off in two months. C'mon.
"Difficult to put on...no zipper.  Do not seem true to size.
Appear to be good quality.  Would suggest at least a full size larger than
shoe size."
"This is the worst t-shirt I have ever purchased. The design is neat, but the shirt doesn't fit well, and the material is so bad that I was afraid to wash it.  I was just in DisneyLand and purchased an official Star Wars shirt there that fits really well, is made well and the material is of good quality. This shirt is not that.  I do not recommend."
"These are cute. Too bad about the poorly-made quality and low-quality fabric inside! If you LOVE putting your feet into 1970's polyester shirt sleeves, these slippers are PERFECT for you. Unfortunately, I do not enjoy doing that. In fact, I loathe polyester. So these, despite being cute, are basically Satan in slipper form in my mind.

Hyperbolic? Yes. Correct about the quality and comfort levels? Yes."
"I wanted to like this bracelet, but the knots are all messed up and it does not expand as advertised. Looks nice and would be cool if I could wear it, but it is a knotted piece of junk."
"we had to return, we thought we measured my husbands feet correctly, but it is true to size. We bought a size too small."
Great time of the month underwear.
"These were really cute, and a great price, so I was excited. They actually seem pretty good quality, but the whole rubber toe area is very narrow top to bottom and squished my feet.  I even ordered a full size bigger, just to compensate for winter socks and such.  I have a very narrow feet, and thin feet from top to bottom, but my feet were going numb, and I had to take them off.  On one of the feet the seam where the rubber meets the leather part has a huge bump that was so uncomfortable I couldn't even wear it while I was sitting down for 5 minutes. I would have loved to keep them, but they were just too small and not made correctly for feet."
"For some reason, I was expecting this belt to be narrower and a darker red than it ended up being. I like thin belts and so this did not fit the bill. However, it was so cheap in price that it wasn't worth returning. It also appears to be genuine leather as promised, and is thick leather at that.

UPDATE: Because the belt was wider and brighter than I expected, it sat in my closet for a couple years without being worn. When I did have an opportunity to wear it, some of the red color came off after being tried on with my outfit, so I didn't end up wearing it after all. It remains in my closet having never seen the light of day. I'll probably donate it to Goodwill on my next closet purge.

If you need a cheap belt for a costume or short-term wear, maybe this would be okay. But don't expect it to last!"
Looks cheap. Top sits strangely.
Came with screws apart. Sent back
"The two outside bands are pretty but the middle plain band is actually more like a metal washer.  I was looking for a look such as this set but will be returning it due to that middle ""ring""."
"The shirt fits great until you try to wear a tie with it, the collar is not made to be worn with a tie and thus it warps and looks awful, due to how cheap the material is and it has no collar inserts to keep the collar from folding. But it is also tailored as a dress shirt, and it can't be worn casually untucked without looking like a hot mess."
i ordered a small and received what looked to be an extra large. i couldn't tell if it was a small or not because there was no tag
Very small shirt. Arm Length not even near what it should be. Nice shirt just small
Made of cheap soft foam.  Should be more resilient to work.  Looking for a felt product.
"what I received was not black, it was grey. it was also more of a large then a medium fit. I however was to lazy to send it back that I am making due with it."
Looks good but mis-sized.
"They are comfy but very ugly.  In addition, both soles have holes in them already and I have only had them two months.  I only wear them in the house, so I don't understand why they didn't last.  I will not buy these slippers again."
"As someone else mentioned, as soon as these got wet the glued in insoles pulled away from the soles and bunched up toward the toes.  Who ever decided to use non waterproof glue in shoes that are designed to be worn in water is an idiot.  They were comfortable up until that point."
"I wish i  would of sent these pants back. i ordered these in medium size of petites. Well they are  a big snug for me. i should of got them in a large or got misses instead in misses size. These pants suck far as sizing, the size is way off. i weigh 126 lbs. These pants are like for hip- muggers . They ride up my ass every few minutes when i walk. Have to  pull them down so i don't get a  wedgie  up my ass all t he time. Far as  the heavy blend material, they could be heavier blend. i walk a lot and wearing long-johns under the pants, they are  tighter fitting and  still walk with  a wedgie  up my ass. i  will never buy these pants or any other kind of pants online again. The sizing is way off i can see that with many products that i looked online so far.  People that make or set the sizing online should be more accurate then they are now. I don't think i will be  many clothes online if i can help it. I will go directly to the department store to by clothing from now on. Oh Ya, The pockets on these pants are very shallow built. I am afraid to put  my keys in it. Thinking they will fall out. So i cut the bottom of the pocket  out  where it curves  and added a piece of material onto it extra and sewed it by hand, ( don't have a sewing machine). It takes time but i have a lot of time to do this by hand. I added another 6 inches on from the curve of pocket to the bottom of pocket. Now the S.O. B's are now 10 inches long. Will hold a cell phone and keys in each pocket without worrying about losing either one. Also the inseam from the crotch to waist are to short. i like pants that fit to the waist line, not hip-hugger style. Well i will only wear them when i go grocery shopping. They will last till i die probably lol. Ginny"
"I have an old pair of this kind of underwear that fits really well... probably because the band is worn out. These seem too tight in the band while the rest is a balloon! If I purchased them in a size to comfortably fit around my middle, the rear would probably be hanging half-way down my thighs. My tummy isn't even that big - though I think my rear is... so... this seems backwards."
"Well, I guess these work for some people but not me.  As others have said,  they run small in the waist  and large in the hips and thighs.  I'm built relatively straight but have always been able to find a size that works. In these however, even though they are stretchy,  the size that fit the waist was very baggy elsewhere  and kept rolling around. Since this cut probably works for someone  I would  not have given it such a low rating  if it weren't for another problem.  There is  almost no gusset  and a very thick seam  that cuts in exactly the places that underwear should not   surprising, given the baggy  fit in those areas.  I wish  I could return underwear."
"This is the first Under Armour product, and I own/owned many, that I'm not happy to have.  The difference between having these gloves on and not having any gloves at all is not very great.  They are also useless for operating electronic devices such as the iPhone.  I'm not really certain what one would use these for."
Way too shiny.  The shoes looked like cheap plastic.  Also they ran quite small.  I had to return them.
way too small did not like the texture.
"The shape and cut are so cute but after only 3 delicate hand washes... holes :(

So far it only seems to be a problem with the black ones (ordered 3, holes in all of them).  Will update if it happens to the grey and white.

I truly love the lines and would very much prefer to pay more for a quality material.  Looking for 95-100% cotton in this style. If anyone knows where I can get it, please lmk. Thanks!"
"I have many Elomi bras and this one definitely has a smaller fit.  The bra straps are NOT long enough for someone with a longer torso.  If the straps were long enough it wouldn't be so small as to be unwearable. But, the straps are too short and make the bra too uncomfortable for me to wear. Of course I didn't realize this until after I'd worn it, but at least I know not to repurchase this particular style.  It does seem to be the same quality as the other Elomi bras I own, and it is pretty."
Will snag ALL your clothes!!! Pretty otherwise! Smh
"I knew I was purchasing a CHEAP jewelry set but it turned out to be a lot lower in quality than I was expecting from an Amazon Collection piece.

I received a blue sapphire ring from my husband for Christmas and wanted to get a low cost necklace and earrings to go with it. I ended up purchasing this one strictly because it matched my ring the best. I should have heeded the warnings of other reviewers.

When it arrived the chain was in several knots and the earring posts were both bent. One a lot worse than the other (see picture). The metal is so flimsy I was able to straighten some but it will always have a weird groove when it was originally bent. The chain is laughable it's so thin and flimsy.

I'm not returning it because honestly it's not worth the hassle for the price. But be warned about the low quality."
"I ordered a black pencil skirt but instead received a long black cardigan.. which the only reason I'm giving this seller more than 1 star is because I really did like the cardigan and wore that to an interview, and luckily was able to borrow a pencil skirt. Overall I can't be too mad because it worked out for me, but BUYER BEWARE."
Fabric was rough to the touch.  My neighbors daughter is 8 years old and I gave it to her because the Womens size M fits her and not me.  I noramlly buy size small but didn't know about sizes so I went larger.  Should haven't went XXXlarge.  Great for little girls not womens.
One shoe the lights will not shut off.  I had to send it back for a replacement.  Hopefully that will will be ok.
It took forever to arrive and was cheap and cheesy in quality.
Fit ok but the gold heel on a brown show was definately not my style
"Bought in February. The strap just broke. Haven't even had it a year, and I don't regularly carry it to even cause over wear !"
It was good for one use. Then it ripped all over. :(
Not really tapered for athletic thighs and butt.
Fit as expected and look great with skinny jeans and leggings.  BUT I've only worn them twice and they scuff extremely easily! !!! I bought the black pair and I already have many spots where the black is wearing off and causing brown scuff marks from the material below. I usually buy my boots from Target or Steve Madden and I will just stick to those quality brands from now on.
These were small.
I wanted to buy a jacket instead I received a tent very big tent with junk material never ever by such crab
Don't order these.  Horrible quality
"This was not a very durable wallet, its a shame, because I really liked it. Within a month, the ID holder burst out the side and now the ID slides out the top or side. If I didn't like it so much, I would have replaced it, but I'll try to hold out as I like to get a wallet about once a year.

Maybe next time I'll try downsizing the wallet and getting this one again, I just don't see how a low stress area that holds one card could break so easily."
"I have several pairs of this same size and style that fit great, these did not fit.  They might be irregulars, I don't know.  I will be returning them."
WAY WAY WAY TOO SMALL.  Good quality - for people.  Our Asian friends are still learning just how big we really are in this Land of the Giants.
this slipper is a piece of garbage!!! one week after I got them the sole separated from the slipper. now the other sole is the same.. the paint is chipping off and slipper looks like it is years old.. It is made in China by people who do not know what they are doing. it isn't worth 2 cents! don't buy this slipper the quality which used to be good is darn awful
"Don't like them, it like wearing an out of script glasses."
The shoes were well made and beautiful.  They were comfortable when I put my foot in and fit well.  The only problem was that the heel was too high and I had difficulty walking in them.
Complete rubbish.  Didn't work from the first application.  What a waste of money.
I can wear just about any flips but these things are like walking on bare pavement.  Wore them 1x and the worst sciatic pain after the day was over.  :(
I tried to put the necklace on and it broke! I was going to use it for my daughter's wedding but I couldn't. It was a disappointment. No quality whatsoever.
37 EU was received instead of 38- way too small I'm afraid.  Shame as they are well made boots.
"Very hard to use, don't slide easily."
This dress is not true to size. The large was like a medium.  The material is very clingy.  The pattern looks too mismatched at the seams.  I returned it.
I wanted to love this watch but the hands don't move. The digital part is fine though.
"This is a party hat, not something I could wear to church. I was hoping for better quality & am very unhappy with this hat. Please give me a refund."
"The fit was dead on.. however, I've only worn it once. Walking through rain, just rain..little wet spots came up that never seemed to dry. After washing it, only the one item, spots remained. I treated it and hand washed, even worse. I give up"
Too small. Need 2-3 sizes bigger
"I always liked Hanes T-shirts, I have over 20 of them, but lately I became very disappointed, I'm wearing Medium, but several last T-shirts came oversized, although size is marked as Medium, they were ok for a friend of mine who is usually wearing L, or even XL.
Interestingly, some reviewers pointed, that their T-Shirts are too small, so, I'm guessing,  sizes are really  random. I still have older M-size Hanes T-Shirts which are OK for me, except that sleeves are still too long. Looks like Hanes products have inconsistent sizes.
Regarding quality - some older T-Shirts - ripped under the arms, so, quality suffered as well.
Very disappointed."
I first refused to wear these because it was to cold outside but when I first tried it on it was sliding off my butt and I don't even have a butt just thighs then this line appeared starting from the top to the bottom coming all the way down to my ankles it just ruin the leggings completely I had throw them away.
"I bought these boots because they were very cute. The quality, however, is terrible. The inner layer of material was sewn incorrectly so bad I had to send them back. Do not buy these boots!"
"It said in your add that it was a big kid size 8 but it was a toddler 8 if that, when I received it. I also noticed that a lot of reviews said the same thing. You should correct your add its frustrating to be excited about getting something to give your kids only to find out that it is not the right size. Apparently nobody reads the reviews because a lot of people complained about it in the reviews. Its also a hassle to have to wrap it back up and go to the post office. I have to say though that Amazon is usually very good and I have had few problems."
Too short and very cheap fabric.
"This product was a waste of money. The one size fits all is ridiculous. It is way too long for my elderly mother. The slippers are not well made - while they are way too long, the toe box is so tight, she could barely get her feet into them. I would definitely not recommend these houseslippers."
"Loved them until the weather got above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The blue rubber part of ear piece melted, cracked, and fell off. Completely unusable now."
"Not as pictured, cheaper mayerial"
Another prime example of convenience over comfort. They are very convenient...but not very comfortable! There should be a wider selection of shoe widths available.
"Everything shows through this dress, very thin material and looks cheap.  It had a hole in it when I received it, too much trouble to send back so will fix the hole and use it as a nightgown this summer."
"I ordered these slippers for my husband three times trying to get the right size. He wears a size 11 shoe, so I first ordered an 11. They were too shortl; then order a 12,  still too short; lastly ordered a 13. The 13 was the right length but  the overall slipper was too big. The slippers are well made but the sizing is way off."
very tight...not like photo
"My feet are not very wide. I'm a B and I find wide width sandals more comfortable. I searched high and low for evening shoes in all price categories. I tried these and they are not returnable. New rule, only buy shoes if they are prime! I tried a couple shoes by Annie. The others were prime and I sent them all back. They were terrible quality with terrible fit and terribly crappy materials. Also, in person, they are not pretty! At this point I have purchased a number of shoes via Amazon at great value for superior products. These Annie shoes DO NOT fall into this category. Avoid the entire brand."
"These Pumas are super cute and cushiony. I so wanted to love them, but the first day I tied them up for a run, I couldn't make it half a block before returning home and putting on my older running shoes. Too tight. I mean, super snug to the point where my foot ached when attempting to jog. I could not push through, and it isn't about breaking them in. I really wish it were a success story. Dang!"
"So small! I normally wear a size L in shirts/12 in dresses, but got the extra large given the reviews. The extra large in this shirt was still too small! I'm not sure this was actually intended for real adult women with shoulders or bustlines; definitely a ""juniors"" item, if not a children's item!"
Looks good but fits much smaller than it should as a size 9 1/2
It was just too small for me.
"One size should have been a caveat, but no, I bought this anyway.  It's very stretchy, feels like it's made of thick opaque panty hose.  Problem is, it feels like you're being choked by a midget while you're wearing it, as even the neck is small.  The sleeves are not long enough and shrink back up your arms, and the worst part of the fit is the hips-to-waist area.  The material rolls up your stomach as you move until your belly button is showing, forcing you to constantly pull it down.

I bought this for a costume; I'll wear it for parade day, but it will be going to the donation stack as soon as I'm done with it."
The product I received is NOT what is pictured here. It's close to the same but a different shape and the blocks of colored fabric are layed out differently. It does not wrap all the way around and is very cheap looking. It's also not very practical or comfortable to wear.
it broke off my pandora bracelet
Poor quality....smelled AWFUL out of the package. Still can't get the smell out even after washing it.
"Didn't like them, seemed too flimsy and not enough support to really be able to work out/run in them. I decided to return them and find a pair that were light AND supportive instead (Nike)."
"Disappointed, quality is ok, but made in China."
"I ordered these red pair and was really excited about the adjustable waist, I put them on and they didn't cover my butt, cut into my baby bump, and are not to my ankles( I'm 5'5).. I have a grey pair that fit perfect.. I went to return and they want me to pay for return shipping.. they are $13 leggings that are not what they said they were.. Disappointed"
Very loosely woven. Not sure how it will hold up but the black set I got is nowhere the quality of costco socks.
"This product was timely shipped and arrived in good condition.  However, this is my second try with this brand Mania, with my first order being a complete waste.  These ""boy shorts"" are closer to a G-string in that they cover about half of a Size 4 to 6 backside, ride up, are flimsy, and quite possibly the most uncomfortable underwear I've ever purchased (I purchased a large BTW).  This was my last try with this brand.  Forget about it unless you're teeny-tiny with the rear of a 20-year old."
"I honestly wish I could return them and want to. badly. They look very cute, but they fit awful. terrible. I have normal width feet, and these shoes are soo awfully narrow. they hit right at the bone at the base of my pinky toe and large toe and I did manage to get through an eight hour day and the shoes did stretch, however, the pain was excruciating and they're still too narrow as it stands. I would pass on these, unfortunately. Cute, but as it is I can't wear them and honestly..they're not cute enough for the amount of pain they cause."
"shirt was too big, not slim fit at all. You can get this same thing at a sporting goods store."
"These were really really tight and painful after my c section. I couldn't wear them and bought some basic games grannie panties immediately, much better. Could be good for smaller ladies but I hated them."
"The scarf is small and thinly knitted. Looks like something I could find in a rinky dink dollar store. Not worth what I paid. On the upside, I gave it to my son and he wears it every day."
"I ordered the exact same thing I ordered before, but Fruit of the Loom has decided to go cheap with their ""premium"" product.  These are not the same as they used to be.  The material is thinner and the fit is horrible. They are going back. Fruit of the Loom has lost a customer.

Update - 3 months later - Amazon can't find the returned item and now they are going to charge me for what I returned.  Starting to lose the attraction."
I bought the 110 piece and it sent me about 30 ...very disappointed xc
First time I wore these a broken less than half an hour I was very disappointed cuz I bought them to wear on a cruise which was also disappointment
Very cute very small and came with a hole. I was very disappointed as these were for my kids to match for Christmas. I'd suggest ordering a size or two up.
"It was too small, never ask me for a size, I cant used it because it was small size and I need in medium."
Feels like hard plastic instead of leather.
"They look good a little tight . Don't sneez or your fly will be quickly unzipped
Material is thick cotton I had to wear them in a little I hope the cotton gets softer once I wear them more I don't use an electric dryer and I wouldn't on these even if I did . They would shrink . Although the thick cotton seems constricting I wore these two days and the pants seemed to expand more and feel more stretchy . The first time I put them on before pulling them over my big booty or trying I thought I would have to return them . And instantly my zipper flipped down I thought they didn't fit well I pulled them up and gave myself a camel toe a bit ;( and tried to set them .
After a few hours the jeans relaxed will update after washing.

He 3rd time wearing them I'm so pissed and I love the way they look on me but being at work and every movement somehow only at work where I stand they unzip I think I may try to sew it again idk

I ended up calling amazon explaining this and returned these. the thought was nice."
Si disappointed the shirt is not even fitted and the material is so cheap and thin bought this for my bf was embarrassed when i opened it so annoyed
"Purchased this set for my son who loves fire trucks. The fit was small, the pants were made of terrible fabric and actually molded when I had them sitting in the laundry and it did not wash out.  The shirt was cute but again - ran small."
"These shorts are completely useless. They have a very high waist, ample room around the buttocks but none around the thighs. I think these were designed for skinny teenagers who wear pants around their knees."
"Material was so super soft, that is the only reason it gets one star! It is NOT sized accurately at all. After reading reviews first I knew I should order the next size up, but that didn't even help. There was no room for my breasts. They went under the cups and over the top of the cups. Such a disappointment! Also, the design of the bottom of the tank is like a bell shape kinda, and so it rolls right up! I would have needed several sizes larger to accommodate my breasts properly."
Followed size chart but pants are way too big.
"I purchased these in order to wear under a wig that I got for Halloween and they did not stay on my head.  As soon as I got them on, they started slipping off my head.  Then, when I tried to put the wig on over top they completely came off.  For the price it wasn't a huge loss, but it was disappointing that they did not work for what they are made for and I couldn't even use them. Now I have two wig caps that I don't know what to do with.  I would not recommend buying this, most wigs come with enough of a built in cap to cover your hair."
Not what i was looking for.  Dickie was a very good company for the returns adjusted my acocunt asap. thanks
The shoe is cute and would likely be comfortable if not for the overly tight elastic laces. The laces combined with a tongue too short to easily pull makes the shoe un-wearable for me. I had to return them.
it's too small for it's size 7.
I loved them but one broke after a week.
"Please picture different angles of the lingerie, like the back view.  I would never have purchased this if I had known the entire back (the base of the lace string being the hem) was a corset lace."
This dress is very short and is not a Large.  Great colors.
Poor quality...3x is more like a karge
"I like the boots, but could not wear them cause I have a very high in step, and a wide calf.  I could not even get my foot down in them, therefore I am sending them back.  And I normally wear a size 8M, but I bought a size 8 1/2 M and they still did not fit."
It fits but it is crazy uncomfortable
Low quality thin socks.
"It is a beautiful item however it is not true to size. I am large chested and curvy ( US SIZE 14-16) so I got a XXL, however when it arrived at my house I went to put it on and you would have to only way 100lbs and be a size 2 to get it on. It would not wrap around me at all. Very disappointed."
"really liked it and took the tag off right away. It is warm and stylish, light.
However the stitch got screwed at 1st time usage"
"Looks nice, but the handle looks like it is not real leather. The handle is now cracking after only three months."
Son could not wear due to the sizing issue.
"The product came exactly on the day out said, but the glasses are too wide for my face... Other than that they're okay."
"Good quality and nice looking, however way too small."
Bad quality. Got small holes really fast and the color became patchy after washing. I wondered if maybe it was a knockoff and not the genuine brand.
I really love the shoe it's so soft but it's to wide to say I ordered a Medium.  I wish when I walk it would not get even wider. Not happy but nice shoe.
"I have a pair of Jambu in a similar style that I purchased 2-3 years ago.  They are very comfortable and I still get a lot of compliments on how cute they are.  The quality of this Holland Pump is extremely poor compared to my older Jambu.  The footbed is hard & uncomfortable (feels like plastic); the sizing is off (old pair is a 9, which is what I ordered and my foot was swimming); the heel & sole are plastic; and the faux fur screams cheap (unlike my old pair where the faux fur is similar to Uggs).  Very disappointed overall.  I'm hopeful that the poor quality is related to this particular shoe and not the current Jambu line in general.  Thanks Amazon for a great return policy because these are definitely headed back."
Came in broken. The bottle was cracked and leaking and there was no tube to reach to the bottom.
"If they would have just use the same fabric shown  in the picture with the same colors the dress would have been OK. (the lace is different and is fushia the skirt is coral)  Just look at the photo I attached.
Dress is from China so exchanging is a pain."
It looks much better in the picture. I purchased a small but it fit like a large on the top. The waist was okay but it was very frumpy looking at the top and hips. I had a tailor take it up at the shoulders and in at the hips but it still doesn't look right. The problem is in the backside which isn't shown in this pic. It was cut with too much fabric. The effort to get it redone was not worth the value. I should've just returned it.
bigger than stated
"This is so disappointing.  When I received the bag I loved it. Loved the zebra loved the bright purple loved the size, then I used it. Second time using it the loop that holds the D ring on for the shoulder strap ripped. I only had bag about half full with fairly light things. The heaviest item in there was probably my sketchers go walks."
"width is fine for me everywhere except the heel.  The heel was slipping as I walked around the house, so they are going back. My toe was very near the edge too.  I ordered a size up from my usual 9.5 (Eur 40 birkenstocks) and they still may be a bit short.  Inside they say 41.5 Eur which doesn't seem accurate to me."
"the size was very small unusual, very coarse cloth and uncomfortable.
not recommended in my opinion, also the price was high ."
"I saw this online and had to have it, but I was so disappointed in the quality. Unfinished hems, threads hanging off of seems, poorly stitched. Returned it without hesitating."
"Poor quality. Very unimpressed.
Leather may be real but super cheap. Started cracking majorly as soon as I put my foot in.
Ucomfortable. Design is much worse than in the picture. There was glue on the shoe. There was a tear in the shoe.
The perforated design are far from from properly done.
I'm not sure how to attach pictures but I took pics of this all."
Like out of a cereal box
"OMG! I had high hopes for these shoes, but they run very large. I had to return them."
"These shirts are too short.  They fit well in the shoulders and around the middle, but they need to be about 4 inches longer.  I never wear them because I'm too fat for my belly button to be shown to anybody.  I wish I hadn't bought them.

But - the quality seems good.  The material and stitching seem solid - just too short for me to wear."
Zipper broke first day.
Not as cute as expected
"For the price, I couldn't pass up the deal and because I work as a nanny, my purses tend to get destroyed rather quickly and become a home to snacks, food, and misc. items on a daily basis. I'm happy with this purse and it's nice that it repels stains and keeps it's look. I know others have mentioned problems with the straps falling off but I haven't had any problems yet. It's also a nice size and it fits perfectly cross wise and I'm 6'1. It also holds pretty much everything I need- wallet, keys, brush, chapstick, ect. The side pockets are a nice added bonus so I can keep my pens on the outside pocket and not in the inside where they destroy the fabric.

UPDATE: The complaint that most had with the straps breaking or the part where the straps attach to the purse is indeed true. Everything has broken and there's no way to fix it. The purse has literally fallen apart in less than 2-3 months. So with that said I took three stars away because I'm really disappointed that it didn't last very long and isn't very durable."
"Instead of sending me this adorable dress in petite size large, I was sent an ridiculously enormous pair of ugly double knit capri pants like a fat lady whose given up on style would wear."
"UPDATE: The higher quality ones from last year were made in India. The newer, terrible ones were made in Honduras.

I bought a couple of packs of these last year. They were so stretchy and comfortable. I ordered another pack last week and the fabric is different. Not nearly as stretchy, and thinner. The elastic around the waste is cheaper quality also. I really loved the older, better quality ones. I can't believe I just paid $16+ for the cheapies I just received."
The elastic in the tops of the socks were too tight for my husband.
"Would've been okay, but I had on a wig so it was too small...the ears stood up on their own so that was a plus."
These are way to tight on your feet and the shoestrings do not go all the way up. Not sure what to do with boots that only lace half way. I don't have thick calves and I'm short so I'm not sure why these weren't made correctly but I'm very disappointed that I spent good money on something that isn't made right
Big as a tent with toothpick sleeves.
"These were adorable, but WAY too big! I normally wear a 7 and ordered a 6.5 but they fit more like an 8. Bummed I couldn't make it work"
"Way too big. A lot bigger than my daughter's other 3-6 month pants. By the time she can fit into them, it will be too warm for them."
"Not what i thought it was gonna be, material is very silky , they run big, but could be cool if you get the right size"
"I ordered these and they fit just like I want however the design is not symmetrical....on every single one of them.
I really want to wear them but with the design being uneven it looks rather tacky. Sometimes I wonder if the multi-packs like these are created because they are composed of unsymmetrically designed pairs of underwear."
"The first bracelet arrived and as soon as my daughter tried it on the bracelet broke due to a dry/old elastic band. Seller replaced the bracelet and the new one arrived and had the same issue. I guess this is an obvious case of ""you get what you pay for"" It's too bad because it's a cute bracelet."
Again much smaller than I thought.
Not what i expected. Way too much glued on glitter. Item returned
Not real vans knock off I will be returning the words are fading off the shoe in one week. One week later the vans sign came off. These are not authentic
"The fit was ok, it was uncomfortable and way to sheer and thin for a everyday bra. I returned it."
I wear between a medium and large and I purchased a large.  It felt like a junior cut.  It was very tight for being a large.
"I am 5'2, 34d, 130lbs, and this is not a flattering corset. I ordered a medium and the bottom is too big and the top is too small. I am basically falling out of it."
"I was an Asics 2160 and Brooks Adrenaline wearer. The moment I put these shoes on, I knew I had made a mistake. The supplier was excellent. Great customer service and I felt bad returning them. I then ordered directly from Road Runner Sports. Ordered Four Pairs of Brooks Adrenaline, 1 for each member of my family and they all love them. Road Runner Customer Service is over the top great. This shoe might be okay for others, but I much prefer the 2000 series of Asics."
Tiny and lacks luster.
"Well I love Merrells, it is all I wear...these look great and feel great but they are a very wide width, not medium, I walked right out of them, a tripping hazard! So sad because I love them otherwise, wish they weren't so wide. My foot is a medium to widish foot, but these shoes are just way too wide and loose, had to return."
The hell height is not close to three inches.
These are great... or they would have been if they didn't get a run in the crotch after first time wearing them. I couldn't get myself to throw them away so I can only use them for baggy shirt days. Really wish these would have been able to last.
shirt was like a golf shirt and very shiny. it was smaller than expected. I returned it afraid that it may shrink
I've purchased several different brands and styles of bra lately and I find that this one is the most uncomfortable I've ever worn!  It's OK short term but I'm latex sensitive and this one irritates my skin much more than others.  Will not purchase again.
"I really like the shoes, but . . .the size 11 turns out to actually be a size 9.  I'm not sure my 9.5/10 size feet will fit.  My heel almost hangs off the end."
I have never had a more uncomfortable pair of shoes or been in more pain after wearing a pair of shoes which is really shocking has Crocs are amazing I have a lot of co-workers that wear these to work and Rave about them. I bought them they were way too large which I read a lot of people have that problem with them and throw them in the dryer to shrink them so I did and it worked and then they were too small either way it just wasn't a good fit I ended up throwing them out they were horrible
"too tight to get on or off, narrow toe, not a rough or study as they may look"
Shirt was smaller than expected and it had an odor.
This will make your mid section sweat if it is a warm day. Such cheap material.
"credit card holder fell apart and out of wallet about 2 weeks after purchase
waste of money."
Fit well just very thin wouldn't buy again
"I thought these would be the same that are in the store ... but they have a weird, shiny canvas top to them. Not a fan of that.

Also, they tore on the sides within the first 2 months of wearing them. Pretty disappointed. I should have just purchased them at Journeys."
"Not worth buying. Doesn't clean, leaves a film over everything. Returning it."
Worst shoes I have bought for work.
Did not expand wnough to fitbackofwarch
Way too small.. Sent back
smells horrid
Way smaller than other gerber sleep n' plays.
You have to put it together and its just two halves that are held together with a small amount of velcro.
Does not seem that it is for adults.
"After wearing for  a short period of time, they will not stay up- they drop down your leg."
"I don't particularly care for this product. I did not notice any hydrating feature, in fact, It sort of sat on my skin rather than blending it in."
Way too big and long.
"The ring is yellow - marked , but doubt  gold... Looks like a cheap jewelry - which it actually  is.  My daughter  likes it- so she got it."
The orange is more like a neon orange and bunched up at the outer thighs. It looks like it was made this way but it looks very odd. Not happy with it at all.
Love the design but I thought these would be white with lalck polka dots.  They are deceptively dark gray with black polka dots.  Returned.
"A somewhat inexpensive alternative.  Material is very thin and easily wrinkled,  the collar just lays over, no sizing or reinforcing built in, or cut on the bias to support."
Insole wore instantly
"Returned them, didn't fit as anticipated, were not comfortable at all.  Received the product, put them on and didn't even walk around as they were tight and narrow.  Certainly not as anticipated for 4E wide width running shoe.  Gave 2 stars because Amazon didn't have a problem with refunding the full amount -- no restocking fee."
Too small for stated size should have sent them back but had to use them
"I bought several of these and the this one the sleeves do not reach my wrist, they are shorter than should be. Not happy woth this purchase."
"I keep this in an unheated garage.  The heating pipes don't generate enough heat to warm, none the less dry the gloves.  If keeping the unit in a cold (unheated) area and expect your gloves, or mittens to be dry, you have been warned. The pipes should be insulated to allow heat to rise.  As it is, the length of the pipes allow the heat to dissipate before ever reaching the gloves."
The cup size was too small so I had to return it. There was not a larger size available.
My previous Yaktrax had a strap that went over my boot and stayed on.  This one didn't and constantly fell off.  They were pretty useless for me. I still use my old ones despite their age and condition.
"cheap material.  Poorly made w/neck seam of sweater w/material already unraveling.
just awful.
thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy because I sent this back immediately."
"Not very soft, VERY see through. Have returned"
"Big big bummer of my day, trying on a skirt that you bought a few sizes too big to realize that it's still a few sizes too small. Even so, if you aren't a size 2-4, I'm not sure the cut of the dress would drape well."
"Mediocre plastic flip-flop of a very light weight, not particularly cushioning plastic. While I appreciate the (slight) heel cup, these have little arch support. Additionally the thin straps don't do much to keep these flip-flops actually underfoot. I'd send back but they were shipped to our vacation site and received use."
Ordered the largest size but waay waaaay way too small
"I read reviews and saw picture of bigger ladies wearing these dresses but even though I went up a size it was still too tight for comfort. It stretches to fit anyone really, but when it stretches the fabric takes on a white hue the more it's stretched making it obvious that it's not correctly fitted around your boobs in particular."
waste of money. when you walk it is too noisy and will annoy the whole people in the room. had to return it.
"This dress was so unflattering. The material just showed every lump or bump. You could see my bra strap line!! I hate to give negative reviews, but this dress just wasn't worth the money. I was so disappointed."
"I ordered the blue.  I received light green.  Material is different from listing picture- super thin slip-type material, no front dart seems, neckline is much lower, and the dress hits above the knee.  Total fail.  Oh well, amazon customer service is great and quickly processed a return label for me to send it back for refund."
Dug into the arch of my foot. Not comfortable. Returned.
"Sent them back after trying on.

Positives: 54"" waist fit perfect; built like a tank

Negatives:
""generous cut through the seat and thighs"" fits like a tent on me below my huge beer belly; I guess they have to choose the cut, but this cut isn't for guys with 'normal' hips, thighs and calves (say proportional to muscular shoulders)

way too long for me; for decades I wore 30"" Levi 501s that would break over the shoe top and almost drag on the ground by the heel, not quite;  these at a 30"" inseam are way beyond that, I'd have to get 3 inches hemmed to wear them; in disbelief I even got out my yardstick and by golly they are 30""; I'm betting the problem is the long ""rise"" even though I'd tried them on up to my navel

built like a tank, way too thick and stiff for 8.5oz fabric, built for pro lumberjacks;"
"WAAAAY too short! This literally landed at my knees and I am 5'8"". The fabric is cheap as well but probably what I would expect for the price."
"I was really disappointed when I received this to give as a gift.  The part that the chain goes through was twisted to one side.  I understand that this is ""cheap"" jewelry, but at $18, it should at least look decent."
"So they are cute and comfortable. However, I wore them once, washed them once in cold water and hung them up to dry. They shrunk 2 inches and the elastic in one of the legs broke.  Meh!"
"When this T-shirt arrived, I looked very closely at it in different types of lighting to make sure I was seeing the color correctly. This was NOT a deep navy shirt from what I saw. The shirt look straight black with no tinge of blue that I could see or notice. I sent the shirt back and decided not to get a replacement because I didn't want to waste time waiting for another shirt and still get a black t-shirt. The material of the shirt was okay, but I just didn't want a black shirt."
"No era lo que esperaba, pedi comprar unas sandalias crocs y son otra marca!"
"I really took a risk by ordering this dress considering the price. As a loyal Amazon shopper, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, it looked nothing like the photo and is quite thin and see-though. The back zipper closure was not durable as expected. I'm thinking if I try to zip this up too quickly it will fall apart.  As such, I would not be able to wear this to my dinner in a few weeks.

A note to potential customers: I am not paid for my reviews and promise to give honest feedback on all items I order. Too often we see great reviews about items and when we order it is nothing like the photo or what others claim that it is."
"This dress is meant for small to average busted women. Even though it stretches out no matter what size you are, the length of the gathered yoke only comes to mid-bust line if you are a larger size. (I'm 5'5"", L/XL, 41 D  and it hit me mid-bust) The fabric design is beautiful but the top of the dress with the beautiful center piece was sewn in crooked which made the whole dress look ridiculous. Had to return it."
It is to bulky and the connecting points move and displace the second part of the retainer.  I bought 2 unit looking for what I need but I fail.  Description might be improved.
"I bought these because the product description said they were leggings and at the very least ""opaque tights."" They are definitely tights, but not opaque. You can see through them. These are what you'd wear under a dress or jeans...not to be worn by themselves in any capacity. I wear a 10ish and have really thick thighs. I could not comfortably pull these past my thighs. The tights also smelt horrible. I returned them. Not the worth the money."
It is a belly shirt.
This made my eyebrows look like I had put gel on them. It looked AWFUL.
Hat is ok as a hat but the lettering is off center and lower on one side.
Ordered a large fits like a extra small couldn't get it pass my knees tag says large disappointment
One ear was small and mangled and I was unable to return them.
"Actually, it's not to small when it arrives. After 2 times washing and drying the pajama it shrinkes more than what is tolerable.
I will never buy another item at this place. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
"I ordered a size 11 USA.  The box that came said 11 USA on the outside.  The shoes were way to small.  I looked inside the shoes and the shoes were actually a ""10 USA"" size.  Wrong size shoes in the box.  Sent them back."
These leggings are much more like tights than leggings. They are see through and somewhat small as well. They are not thick and fluffy and pant like which is what I expected from the picture. I gave two stars because they will at least work as tights under dresses and they are soft. This is just a misleading product.
"Way to see through, it's like not even wearing a shirt"
"While I assumed it could be adjusted as per seller's description, this bangle bracelet is made of such flimsy material that I am concerned once it is ""adjusted"" a few times it will break into.  Further, it is advertised as being ""gold and silver"" which, after less than one hour wearing it, I broke out in large welts a condition that I only experience when something that touches my skin does not contain any measurable content of either gold or silver.  This must surely be made from only an extremely low content of said materials with some other type of base material added for my skin to react so badly.  Am returning this hummer and cannot recommend to anyone who has allergies to metals other than real silver and gold."
This was shown as one size but it is really good for anyone up to maybe size large.  It is not for an XL guy.
"This looked so great when I saw it on the Macy's model.  It doesn't look great here, and this shapeless oversized bag is what it really looks like.

I was under the mistaken impression this was a winter, wool coat.  I wore it when it was 39 degrees Fahrenheit, and I froze in it.  The coat is incredibly thin, and the wool blend it not up to the job of keeping you warm."
"The print is pretty but like a previous reviewer, I had an issue with the shoulder's being too tight.  I typically wear small and medium tops.  Because of the previous reviewer, I picked medium.  For the medium, the bottom was too wide but the shoulders were too narrow.  While taking it off, I was afraid I would ripped the top. I've returned it."
The material is very soft however after several washes the material bunches up and the ribbon around the waist band twists.
"My guess is these are not authentic Fit Flops.  The bottom of the sole has a slippery covering on it that is not what all the other Fit Flops I've ever owned have had.  I returned these and received an identical pair with the same coating on the bottom.  The coating makes it VERY slippery to walk on tile, etc.  Would not buy again."
dont waste your money. wheres the instruction
"The size is incorrect. They were supposed to be 66mm wide, but are only 60mm.
Going back for a refund."
"Love the design of the hoodie but the material IS NOT, AT ALL, hoodie material. It's some clingy weird material that is a size (or two) too small and it keeps riding up when I try to pull the bottom around my waist. It wants to ride up above your waist. I have NEVER had a hoodie made of this material and I don't want to ever buy another hoodie made of this material."
"It is short and the bottom seam curls up. It ends right beneath the waistline.  You would have to use something else to hold the tummy. I wanted to return it but cant find the tags that fell off during my struggle to get into it. There is no way your can put it on without help. It is also quite thick, not sure if you want the extra inches. I ended up buying a different corset."
"Not for women with curves way to small i ordered a med. But don,t think a large would help. Looks like it's a child's size"
"I have what I assume are pretty standard 12"" calves. These were so tight, I could not zip the boots. I did not want to fight with them as the vinyl had no give. I felt it would rip, so I returned these. They are silly looking and were for a costume."
It stretched out after a few uses. It got to a point where i would fight to keep it up ad one day it almost fell to my knees while I was at work
I don't like these shoes. To big and no confortable. Don't recomend.
Make sure you order a size bigger than you are.  Ring was too small and besides that it looked black inbetween the stones. seller wanted me to send it back and it's not worth it.  now i'm stuck with it.  It really doesn't look at bright as photo (at least mine doesn't)
"I loved the color and the texture, but did not like that they were about six inches too long.  These are definitely made for a taller girl as I am 5'3."""
Too small in the chest/shoulders. Do not recommend. Bad quality
"Tenis size si too small in relacin whit Other shoes of same size, i don't know why no make a regular sizes"
The bright shoe fit smaller than the left. Very disappointed because I really wanted to like this boot.
"The shoe is exactly what I was looking for and as the other reviews stated, the sizing is a bit larger but I am only givin 1 star and would give 0 if possible because the box arrived containing 1 shoe for the right foot only. Now I have to go thru the trouble of re ordering the shoe at a higher price than I originally ordered."
If we weren't in an extreme pinch we wouldnt use it
"Love the wallet...the looks & size are exactly what I wanted...especially like the embossed shamrock. I dislike, however, that the zipper failed after 5 weeks and there's nothing I can do about it. Amazon will take it back up to only 4 weeks after the purchase, and the seller has no warranty beyond the Amazon returns policy. The zipper teeth skipped only about 3 times in the first few weeks. I was able to reopen it and close it again, and the teeth re-gripped. Now it's skipping almost every time, and when I let my wristlet go, strap around my wrist, and the zipper hasn't grabbed, I'm afraid things of import could fall out and be lost before I discover that the teeth didn't grab again. It's a metal zipper, so I thought it would wear like iron. Not so, not so. Until the zipper is improved, I cannot recommend this wristlet."
"You can't really tell in the picture that it's shiny. It's also a lot more rigid than the black leather. Gives it a very cheap look and feel. Returning them, unfortunately  :/"
Very poorly made! After one wear (not even washed yet) one of the straps broke. I was very disappointed.
"I don""t know yet if I like them because I was sent the wrong size. I love the feel of them. But because whoever sent it didn't pay attention to a very important detail, SIZE, I now have the pain of sending them back to get the correct size. I will say based on looking at these, that I will go with the large. I am a size 8-10, but I really hate anything tight!"
The material is not soft at all
"These shoes looked great but were huge in all directions for a medium sizing, and even with an insert were way too big. Sadly returned."
had to give them away.  tight around the top.
Looks like they were worn before me. Torn like paper. Will never perchase from this one again. I'll stick with the silk and shimmers.
"I loved these capris for the fabric (light and cool) and the initial fit, so I ordered 2 more pair in different colors. The first pants I ordered, in navy, fit perfectly at 14. I ordered black and stone next. The black pants fit more like a size 12, than a size 14 (which is what the label clearly says). I couldn't even get them up past my hips. The stone colored fit close enough to size 14 to keep, though not as well as the navy ones. Frustrating. I'll be sending back the black pants. Great pants if you get lucky enough to get the right size."
The seller is not the issue. These shoes are hard and not flexible.
just not a good fit could be my fault getting wrong size time will tell they seem to be cut uneven
"It looks nice in the picture but it way smaller in real life. Got this for my girlfriend, and she's 140 to double wrap it. You'll have to have a pencil neck"
"The legs on these tapper in an awkward way (they get narrow into the knee). I needed a pant that I could actively move in, crouch, sit, and have flexibility with. These aren't any of that. The waist is more-or-less accurate, but the seat of the pant is shallow and anything beyond standing I felt like one wrong move would likely tear the crotch out. The material is decent, and they don't look bad, but I returned them the moment they came in because they're just not made in a way that works for an active job field."
"Bad bad bad! Fit? Ridiculous. Fabric? Strange, stinky, lame. I can't even give this 'thing' away!"
Flimsy thin material. I had to return it.
"Very attractive looking, nice for price, my issue with it was that it would fall over, was continuously picking up from floor, had to lean against walls or myself to keep from falling."
bought XL but the panty was wayyyy to big. I wanted the waist to fit as the pic. will buy again but will try a large this time.
"I just received my order and was expecting to receive the Rhonda Shear ""Ahh Bra"", as advertised. Much to my surprise, instead, I got a clear cellophane package containing 3 bras made by ""Shear Shapewear"", whatever company that is. It does not say ""Rhonda Shear Shapewear"", nor does it say ""Ahh Bra"". I happened to have an Ahh Bra (the real thing--it came in a box from a major retailer) in the house, that I had just purchased for my daughter-in-law, so I was able to compare them. Not only were the labels totally different (the boxed bra said ""Ahh Bra"" on the label inside of the bra), but the quality of the material and the stitching were very poor in the bras I had received from this shipment from Amazon. I am very shocked that Amazon would ship a fake product from this marketplace seller (Xi Wang). I wonder if all of the bad reviews of this product from this seller are due to people getting a fake, cheap imitation product and not even realizing it. Shame on you, Amazon. You had better remedy this situation quickly before more of your customers are cheated!"
"What a disappointment - The hat arrived in a flat plastic mailer, all squashed and crumpled, and it's dark brown and not straw colored like the photo.  It's flimsy, light weight, thin, small and cheaply made.  The adjustment string looks like dental floss.  The brim does not stay rolled up like the photo.  It's out of shape from being crumpled, so the crown is all bent and wrinkled.  Very poor quality and not at all like the photo.  I feel like I've been ripped off and and will be very hesitant to buy anything off of Amazon.com again.  They should not allow this seller to sell on their site."
"Snags easily, colors aren't quite so nice as pictures, and WAY too small."
"Like the look of the shirt but the fit is strange. It fits tight in the arms and is really long, seems to run more like a""tall"" (e.g. big and tall).  It almost looks like I'm wearing a dress if it's not tucked in."
"cheap material not all the way it looks in picture, not a good buy"
"Very small toe box, my feet hurt after a very short distance. Its like there is no padding and I could feel the spikes of the soles.
I love ASICS and this model is just completely different. I will be returning them."
2 stars for construction. That's also for their comfort. they are fine as long as you don't plan on moving while  wearing them. horrible stitching continually rubbing at your feet. Even with socks on they suck hugely.
"Shorts are tight at the leg opening compared to the rest of the garment, and overall runs small"
Did not like. Back was too small and the cups were a little too big!
Buttons fell of before even tried on. Very small fit. Just threw it away because return was a hassle.
The width was not wide at all and does not have the length a foot needs for people with bad feet so the velcro really doesnt mean anything. .
"Cute purse and would have served the function, but the beads were already unraveling.  So - I returned it.  Too bad."
BUYER BEWARE!  What is pictured is NOT what is being sold!
These socks are crap. They are thin and flimsy. I would never have spent this amount of money on these socks had I known they were so poor in quality. Don't Buy Them!
"Good design, well built, just didn't fit well and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning them.  Will only use them around the house due to poor fit, too long, too wide and arch is too high."
"Cute, but couldn't get my foot out of it. It's like one of those little magic finger things where you can get your fingers in but can't get em out!"
Very soft material but two sizes too big
"Didsapointed with size! Always wear 9us its a 42 euro. But Not at this shoes!  Its a size larger maybe half size.
Added:
2 month and now have hole upside! Worst quality! Never buy again."
"These weren't even close to 3mm!  They were more like 1mm, tiny."
Uncomfortable and cheaply made.
"Love, but much too small."
"leg length is to short, they ride up and roll at the waist."
"I got my firs one from Afghanistan, the real deal if you like, and this is nothing more then a cheap knockoff. Thin, made out of plastic and not worth your money. It's not warm, it's not absorbent, it has no function or purpose."
"The shoe looks and fits fine. However, after wearing them for an extended period of time (4+ hours) the pads on the bottom of your feet become very soar. The first time I wore them, I thought it was because they were new and needed to be worked in. Unfortunately, it has not gotten any better. I believe the sole and support must be poorly constructed or there is a defect."
Meh.... not great and really small. If you have curves don't bother!
.5 too big
It compressed from the top down. not flattering at all. You have to order way too large to get the flow look.
"Poor quality! Does not keep head nor ears warm! Tassels are not sewn on making the tassels easy to pull off. Very disappointed. Why isn't the hat the same thickness & provide the same warmth as the scarf? Also, the color is lighter than the scarf. I did not see anything allowing me to contact the seller. Trying to contact customer service, but had to just leave a poor review. Hopefully, someone will contact me about my dissatisfaction. It is cute, but too thin!"
i was expected bigger
"It is SEE THROUGH! It is so thin, it is ridiculous! I am not even sure it is silk because it doesNOT FEEL like silk on my skin. Did not return it because love the hot pink."
The color is not even close. Not even close. It looks aweful. Don't buy this if you are looking to match someone at a formal event
otherwies ok
Way too small. Order at least 2-3 sizes larger if you want them to fit. The quality seems good. I actually order one size larger than my daughter's size to get a little extra time in them but she couldn't even fit in them. Weird.
I tried a Medium and a Large and neither size fit me. I am 5' tall and 125 lbs. I am not a big girl at all and I reallllly struggled getting the large on. I finally got it on and realized there was ZERO support in the bust area. There is NOOOO room for a strapless bra - forget it! It was just a no win dress for me and I really wanted to like it.
I saw this dress price jumped by $20 within a few weeks. I was saving it to order for a bridal shower and was waiting until I got paid. That part was crap since it was 10.88 previously and I paid over 30. The fabric is thin but the print is very pretty.
"Overall as a sports underwear, it works well, but I feel that you need to only wear it for a workout.  This is ok, but I have a somewhat active job and wanted something that would last all day.  These tend to feel a little more uncomfortable as the day goes on.  I actually found the exofficio boxer briefs to be more to my liking.  I would say if you want something specifically for workouts, these wouldn't be too bad, but if you were looking for something to last the entire day, you should look elsewhere."
"I guess I should have paid attention to the part where it says polyester and not cotton.. I hate the material of this shirt. It's one that shows every bukp or bulge you have. It looks a lot cheaper in person than the picture. I definitely would not have paid 30 dollars for this, maybe like 12 bucks but that's it. I didn't have a problem with the sizing because I did happen to read that it was junior sizes so I went a size up. Overall I wouldn't buy it again."
"I bought these ""Big Boys"" socks for my son, who wears a boys size 7 shoe and they were SO SMALL.  They looked like toddler socks.  I returned them, no problem."
"Don't buy these.  The fabric gives good control, but the waistband is a narrow, pantyhose type waist band.  It actually GAVE me a muffin top that's not ordinarily there and the waist rolls down the first minute you have them on.  Sad because the capri length is good and doesn't seem to roll up around the band.  If they improve these with a wider waistband that won't bind, I may consider buying them.  As it is, I'm returning the one pair that I haven't worn yet."
"lasted a week, then the adhesive layer became lumpy and stating to fall off"
Very uncomfortable.  I was disappointed because it is so cute and would have been perfect for the dress I bought it for.
what more can i say?
Ordered Xl and the bra part was the size of a training bra.. can't wear :(
"Bought these for summer, the are so heavy, it feels like your lifting weights while walking...and the toe straps don't help."
Had to return the stones started coming loose.
basiclly these are underwear
"I wore these boots today for the first time in NYC in the aftermath of the blizzard. They kept my feet warm and dry, even when stepping into several inches of icy slush at the curb. The only reason I gave the boots 4 stars instead of 5 is that I did get blisters on the bottom of both of my big toes and I have a sore spot on my lower shin from the boots being stiff. I really hope after these boots are broken in that they will be comfortable. I originally ordered a half size bigger than I usually wear, but after trying them on, sent those back and ordered one full size bigger than normal.

*Edited to add* I wore these a couple of times and they continued to be incredibly uncomfortable. I'd rather have my feet a little cold and have a pair of comfortable boots. I'm planning to sell them, but Amazon has reduced the price of these to almost 1/3 of what I originally paid for them."
ripped the first week
The large was a child size. Useless.
"Too wide, not real suede, too loose and stretchy"
"the three miles do nothing, just painted on, the wristband feels very cheap and the two (whatchamacallit)... knobs don't do anything. why put them there ? just make the watch more sobre, instead of tarnishing it with fake gadget. I DONT LIKE IT"
not really waterproof had to send it back
"Killed my feet.  Normally I love this brand, but these shoes were literally torture."
"This is the first time I ordered a pair of jeans online. I usually find (Not Levi's) in stores jeans that fit perfectly all round including the right length in Petite Short and with a nice cut and shape that flatters my structure. SO when I saw this pair of jeans in Short and with tummy slimming features, I thought it would be fantastic! Rather disappointing after trying. It is too long. I am 5ft 4"" and have a tummy that would look nice if it were tucked in to a pair of jeans! The legs were too baggy for me (Must be my fault) and it did not offer any shape (Must be my fault again). I think the cut and shape of these jeans would fit someone with fuller legs, a longer mid and no muffin top. I ordered size 12 short.
Returning and will stick to what I know works for me."
Temberland cut corners on this shoe. Not of the quality I would expect from Timberland. Would not purchase again.
Ripped the first time my brother wore it
Very unhappy that it does not fit.
"Cheap material, not attractive at all."
Backing should be used over clothes since it make you perspire.
Not a good material.
"Have 3 pair ,all labeled the same size , all fit differently."
These are smaller than the ASICS Nimbus usually are... have been getting these for years but this 8.5 fits like a 7.5. I like to buy a size up to allow room while running. I wore these once for a race and ruined my big toe. Terrible shoe and can't return them.
This shirt is defective. The arms are too short and I am a woman. The shirt is big and the arms are short. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU HAVE UNUSUALLY SHORT ARMS. I cannot see how this shirt could fit the arms of any man. I want to return this item
"They may be good shoes, but even with socks, they felt at least an entire size too large.  I wear a size 8 and that is what I bought.  Should have gotten a 7, but if sizing is so off, I don't trust it to be consistently so.  Sent them back and not trying again."
Someone call China and tell them the average American woman is bigger and taller than the average Asian woman. You would think there would be at least one company that would want to corner this market. Huh? Just a few inches longer?36C?God forbid a size 12!
beatiful dress but is to small
I am 5'2 maybe 115 at the most the waist comes right under my breasts so makes me look like I have a baby belly.
"These jeans would have been perfect if they weren't so poorly made. These are meant to be worn once or twice that is it, anytime after that expect rips or holes or them to look worn."
Bad fabric. Odd sizing. Poor fit.
"Not comfortable at all!!!  Pass these up.  I gave them a 2 star because they look good.  If you're someone who doesn't care that you can only wear them for an hour or less, then go for it because they are blingy cute.  But not pain free!"
"Material was much thicker than expected. Too heavy for someone who lives in Florida. They were about 5"" too long for a man who is 5'9""."
"This hat has a very unattractive ""3M"" logo on the front. I returned."
"tried it once, never picked it up again"
"Watch out when buying these watches. The watch straps are weak, and Swatch only honors any suggested warranties if the seller has some kind of authorized dealer stamp, which my seller - an Amazon partner - did not.

My strap broke within a month of purchase. Neither Amazon nor the seller could help me fix the strap or get any kind of refund.

I know it was not a once off because I mailed my watch in to the seller to be replaced and they accidentally sent me back two watches with the same problem (one to my old and one to my new address). Obviously they must have watches with broken straps just lying around."
Ripped on the seam after first wear.
"34 waist was not true. Way too small.  All of my husband's other jeans same brand fit, so I ordered his regular size, but these were too small!"
The yoke opening is huge!  And after wearing for awhile it stretches even more so it falls off your shoulders.  I would have returned it but I had already washed and wore it. I do like the feel of the material.
tarnished after one wearing. Not happy at all with this product!
Not training underwear.  Will return.  :(
After reading the reviews that the top runs small I ordered an xl when I usually wear a large and the shirt is too snug on my arms and doesn't have that flowing feel I was really looking forward to this top but instead I will be giving it to my sister
With was too narrow
"These sandals are too uncomfortable and narrow, my feet is bulging out on both sides! Very disappointed :("
"This is one of the worst things I have ever received from Amazon.  It's a joke.  It's basically a stick with like 5 twigs attached to the bottom with a string.  If I gave this to my 5 year old as part of her Halloween costume, I'm not sure if she would laugh or cry.  Definitely sending it back."
"Shirt is way longer than expected and has no actual shape, compared to picture."
"My expectation is not met. I feel disappointed. I can't find a good quality material of this I Love Jesus Dangle bead spacer. The price itself is too high. It is way beyond big difference to Pandora style as what they describe. I love how it personalized Jesus name is but I hope they make it worth it the quality as what price is not appropriate for this product. I will not recommend this to everyone. I'm sorry.
Disclosure:I received this for discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review."
"The straw part at the bottm was not like the picture at all. Barely bigger than the broom handle, returning and getting another kind"
"I have purchased RYKS before.  As soon as I put these on they were tight and uncomfortable.  I put them back in the box to return.  Looked like RYKA, but nothing else resembled the quality and fit I expected."
cheaply made and the material is not leather.
"Arms are too snug and a bit long. The length can be viewed as a good thing because it can protect your wrist from sunburn even when you're wearing gloves. However the upper arm area is too snug. If I had a lot of muscles it would be even worse!
-- Marta L. in San Diego"
"Williams Lectirc Shave is a great product that has served men's electric shaving needs for several decades!  BUT DON'T buy it here!  WHY?  I didn't pay close enough attention to the prices vs weight and when it arrived I was really angry!  This is the 3 ounce travel bottle that you can sometimes find in you local drug store for about $2.50, NOT $5.62!!!  For $5.48 - $5.85 you can buy the 7 ounce bottle at every drugstore in your town or on line at CVS.com or Drugstore.com or any other online national drug store chain.  DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THIS SELLER!!  YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET! THE PRICE SHOULD BE FOR THE 7 OUNCE BOTTLE AND NOT THE 3 OUNCE BOTTLE.  RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!"
i hate this... makes me feel HUGE... i only suggest you buy this is your 5 foot 9 and 100 pounds otherwise youll look like a whale.
"These are nice, but they can break.  I had my keys on one of them, and it broke and I lost my keys.  The plastic lever, which holds it closed, broke outward.  Keys gone.  So be careful."
Softness: Five stars.  Warmth: Five stars.  Durability: Zero stars.  These pilled after two wears and two inside-out washes in the delicate cycle. I'll be using them as pajamas since they are not acceptable to wear in public anymore.
"Way too thin for comfort, I returned it. No protection. If all yo are looking for is an underwire with thin  material, this is it."
"Too small, had to return. I am a size 10, had to return and they do not carry an 11."
The quality of the product was disappointing.
"I love the purse, but hate the fact that they used a very, very thin vinyl covering over the purse handles. Everything about the purse still looks brand new, while the purse straps look like they've been through a blender-bits of vinyl pieces tearing off and sticking up all over the handles. That looked embarrassing enough that I had to stop using the purse. Why make such a nice product, then cheap out on the handles, where they get so much use? Couldn't they use just a little bit of real leather on the handles, at least?"
Hard and uncomfortable.  Sending them back.
Just not comfortable as previous New Balance walking shoes have been.  Going to return them.
"I am usually a 4-6 in women's clothing and wear an xsmall or small in all my scrubs.  The small in these is REALLY small.  The elastic dug in to my waist and gave me a mom pooch.  Now, I admit to no longer having amazing abs, but I refuse to wear pants that make me feel uncomfortable or bad about my body.  I would return them in a heartbeat but my kiddos took off the labels.  Really wish I had tried them on at a store before purchasing!!"
This dress runs EXTREMELY small.  The size was nowhere near correct and runs at leat 2-3 sizes too small.
"The bag is nothing like in the photograph.  Firstly, it is off white and secondly it comes with gold hardware and I specifically ordered it because it shows silver.  I live overseas and had a friend bring it back for me so I'm unable to return it.  Very disappointed."
too many straps to be easy to use.
Not true to size chart or reviews
"This worked for my Halloween costume, although I couldn't wear it all night because the elastic cut into my ears so badly. Also, for whatever weird reason, this cap arrived smelling DISGUSTING! Honestly, it smelled very strongly of chemicals and fish. Had to febreeze it and air it outside for two days."
came to me with some of the leather peeling off and within a month the leather holding one of the handles on broke off! I do not recommend this item
"Very good looking, but sole is very thin, & length is a bit short. Not sure why it's called a walking shoe based on the thin sole & low arch. I wore them while walking on sidewalks & around a school track - killed my arches & knees!! It was too late to return them, so I donated them. Maybe someone with a low arch & thicker soles can appreciate these shoes. Not recommending for high arch feet, or hardy walkers."
I had high hopes for this wrap but I'm very disappointed. It has 2 extra pieces that you Velcro after it's already on which makes it lumpy so it doesn't look good under clothes. But the worst for me was that every time I would switch my son from one side to the other while feeding he would cry because this piece would catch on him! It's really uncomfortable for breastfeeding babies and I'm surprised I hadn't read that on any other review. Maybe it's just me.
"Picture is not true, I ordered a medium/large not true to size, it is not long, length to mid section, I am going to give to my niece she is a slender 13 year old."
"As described by everyone else, it runs extremely small so I ordered 4 sizes bigger than I normally do. The larger size means it is longer than I would like but still small through the bust. Also small through waist and lots of extra room in shoulders. Cheaply made but cheaply priced"
"I just bought these and I've only worn them once...and now I'm returning them.  They're really cute, but the ties constantly slide down so you're constantly having to stop to re-tie them.  I tried tying them in a double knot and that didn't help at all.  I have kids and I can't be stopping every 2 minutes to redo the ties on my boots while we're running around - whether at home or out running errands.  Too cumbersome.  And yes, as others have said, they are also very slippery.  I gave them 2 stars only because they are cute, and they were comfy but they just require too much attention."
"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas, but I'm sending it back and getting a different one.  It's pretty enough, but the ""jewels"" are cheap looking flat-back pins that have hot glue covered in glitter on them.  The dress laces up in the back (so no independence when getting this dress on).  And, the deciding factor: it has really stiff netting inside.  There's a layer of satiny material closest to the legs, but not enough, so I'm SURE I'd be hearing about how itchy it is.  The dress is pretty, but not pretty enough to cover the defects and the price."
weird material- didn't look right so i returned it.
Nice looking shoe too bad they do not fit like other Asics.
Its very pretty but it turns your fingers colors.
"I don't understand how I can have a shoe from a company that fits like a glove and get a different shoe from the same company, in the same size and not even be able to get my foot in it?"
"It fits all over but the cups are slightly large. Not even a full size. Maybe 1/4 of a cup size. It isn't very flattering (cone boobs!) but I haven't tried it on with my wedding gown. I wouldn't recommend it to be honest as the material is sturdy but itchy, the odd shape of the cups and the sizing."
"This my second pair in a year
The first one got old so I desided to buy new one with perfect price but the second one looks not brand new like the first one I felt that someone used it for few days and returned it back am really not exaggerating of course I can't return it because I shipped the shoes by  aramex to my country and it will coast lot of money to return it"
"really small, after I tried a couple of times had to give it away"
"Waste of money, flimsy and bad quality. Cute concept though"
Bad material and lasted only a short time
"Based size on the same size of the NYDJ Sheri jean, which fit perfectly. However these are way too small at the waist. Will return"
there is no way that a 54 long should not fit me. Your measurements are not even close to being the standard.
The  design is georgeous the shipping is fast but as soon as it arrived it broke in 2 places!! I fixed it but honestly it's so flimsy I'm afraid to wear it yet
plain ugly shoes
Too small by 2 sizes
"Cotton is rough and thin with very little stretch.  Elastic at waist and leg openings is uncomfortable and
scratchy.  These briefs fit and stay up -- but that's it.  Yes, I did wash according to directions and the
cotton didn't soften nor did the elastic get better.  Something (choice of factory, cotton or elastic)
must have changed for the worse between manufacture of the briefs with good reviews and my
negative experience with the product."
"Avoid this product ------ looks and feels like it is a REJECT that Nautica can't sell in Retail Stores , and can only sell on Amazon.  It is poorly made and skimpy on size . Pockets are ridiculous ------- very shallow .  Made In The Jungles Of Thailand ."
I owned another pair of the Skate shoes by DC and they fit wonderfully. These are too narrow and do not wear very well.
Looks pretty cool but two hours into wearing this watch the first time the hour hand got stuck and no longer moves and you can't set the time.  It's not even worth the hassle of repairing a $35 watch.  I took off the strap which is actually pretty decent and threw the watch in the trash.
"i always wear same size, these are way big"
"The watch looks decent and the case looks OK.  The second hand, being black and as thin as an eyelash is basically invisible as it turns on the face.  My gripe is with the leather band.  It appears fine at first glance but it is very stiff and difficult to put tightly on the wrist.  After wearing it for one day, the tip of the band where it bends as you insert it into the band loop ""cracked"" across the last hole.  The material underneath the leather veneer is some type of black plastic.  I have another similar watch, same size case, perhaps from the same manufacturer but its identical-looking band is supple and conforms to the wrist easily.  If this latest watch had a better, less delicate band I might have kept it.  However, I must return it as defective."
"the crocheting was already unraveling before i even put it on!  it fits fine and is actually cute, but is an inferior product or i just happened to get the wrong shirt...maybe it had been a return?"
urgly.
"These must be for women with no butt.  I am a muscular 135lbs, wear a size 4 - I ordered the small and found that while most of the panty fit fine, the lace absolutely squashed my butt, causing it to bulge out below the lace (and weirdly, a little bit above). It was EXTREMELY unflattering. It's weird how the lace has no stretch to it."
This dress was much too large. I sent it back.
"Looks fine and price seems ok. However, it began falling apart after a couple months."
"One star suggests ""I hate it"" but I don't.  I'm disappointed with it.  I bought a pair of Sanuk's down in Florida and they are the most comfortable shoes I have.  The problem with this pair is that the glued on sole is peeling back.  Poor craftsmanship and I'm likely going to send these back.  That said, they are very comfortable and I love them otherwise, but I don't want to have to throw them out after a month because the sole peeled away.  Love Sanuks, but this pair is disappointing, hence one star.
UPDATE: I used LocTite Automotive adhesive to glue down the front part of the sole that was peeling away and so far, so good.  Love these shoes, but they shouldn't need the attention!"
Returned immediatly.  Not a good quality.
"This tee is made of very thin material -- you can see right through it, at least for the white tee (although I assume that is less of a problem for black). The only way this works is if you will layer on top of the white tee. To give you an idea of how transparent the fabric is, I placed the tee atop a bottle of Diet Coke -- and you can read the lettering on the bottle (see picture) -- so it's easy to imagine what else can be seen when you are wearing it!!

I also found the fit to be off. I am 5'2"" and 145 lbs, with a 38 DD bust, and this tee was too tight overall in a large, although I usually wear a Med or Large in this brand. The tee is also very long, but if you are taller, that may be a benefit.

The details on this tee are nice, including the pleated neckline and shirring on the sides; otherwise, it would only rate 1 star because it is so see-through."
Seconds???
this fell apart and was not worth the money whatsoever. horrible choice
"The size is too narrow, all of my toes,and instep and heel are uncomfortable~~~"
Hypoallergenic doesn't mean it won't rust. The seller says the backing is Silver but they still inflamed my ear after it rusted. Rusting only happens on some earrings.  I bought a few pairs and so far had problem with my second pair.  The first was fine as far as rusting.  Just that the backing gets loose and earrings get lost easily.
Size up 2 or more sizes.  Very very small
Order a size smaller than you normally wear. This is really big.
Shrunk in cold wash from XL to M
"It's nice, but color nothing a like;  more like navy"
"cheaply made, elastic is already fraying after just one trial."
"I forgot that their ""teal"" is really a really gross green. like a toothpaste mint green from the 60's. Really sad cause it is a nice skirt."
"Shoe is comfortable to walk long distances
Not the quality and comfort of previous models such as  Titan Safety-Toe Oxford"
"Fits awkwardly. The part where the cups clip comes way up high, almost to my collar bone. Also pinches under my arms."
nice material and fit my husband great except one arm was shorter than the other ... returned it
bad quality material
"very slippery,the outer sole is not made of rubber  at all ,only sythetic,unlike other flip flop i bought on amazon,very disappointing purchase,dare not wear it "
"I really like the cowboy rainboots but they were to narrow for me, so i had to return them and  they were pick rightway. looking forward to my regular rainboots :-)"
I had to return the shoes because they were too large and they really didn't appeal to me as the picture did online.

Very beautiful but very small.  Would fit perfectly on an average size 12yr old; but way too small for an adult.  Slightly big on my 5yr old.
"I strongly believe that calling this umbrella ""un-breakable"" is false advertisement. Based on the description of the item, I was really looking forward to having a sturdy umbrella but this was definitely not the case. The umbrella snapped and broke after one use, which was unfortunate. I truly wanted to like this umbrella. I hope other people had better experiences with this item than me."
"I got two left shoes! Other than not being able to wear them. The size was a little tight, I would order a size up."
"Gave it away, Nothing like the picture!"
Cheap and came torn. Don't buy
"You get what you pay for.  The material is cheap, thin, and the pants were pretty tight compared to the top which did fit, but had to wear something underneath as you could see straight through it."
"These were too long for me, they're something I would have worn years ago. If you have long legs they might be great for you. Or perhaps they would be perfect for an older gentleman who likes to pull his pants way up to his bellybutton."
Fits tight. Fabric is thick and seems hot. Will very likely return these shorts. Look great though.
There are waaayyyy toooo small.
"The legs are really tight, and i have small calves."
Does not stay in place.
Returned them.  Run small.
these shoes strap broke after my son inlaw wore them only THREE time. very disappointed in product
Very comfortable.....just the sizing is off. I ordered a 3Xl and it fits like an extra large.
"Just got it today. Packing is really good and complete. But the color bezel is black instead of blue, as it seems to be in the pictures ... Also the blue dial is darker than expected. Size is ok, as expected for a 44 mm declared diameter.  But weight ... It's too heavy ... what for so heavy ? Bezel movement is ok: firm and neat. I still have to take out some segments to make it fit my arm and wear it, so next time i'll write further impressions."
Arms too long. Cuffs too large.
"Bought this for my granddaughter in a 6x. The top fit but the pants were several inches short and she does not have particularly long legs. They looked like capris, not pants."
So small it looks like a period at the end of a sentence on paper.
"This bra runs large, squishes you flat and makes you look wider than you are.  Seller will not return the item even though it is not worn so I'm stuck with it."
"Cut too large, and I have a big noggin. Too much material above the ears, gives it a lot of air room above where the hat contacts the head. hat looks cool until I put it on."
"These boots were way to large, they were comfortable but didn't look good on me. I have very narrow calves and when I looked at the pictures I thought they would fit. Also the dimensions in the description weren't clearly stated. I want to return them without paying a return fee because it's unacceptable.
Thus, please send me ASAP the necessary label so that I can drop the box at any USPS store for free!
I will reconsider my view afterward."
Looked OK but did not fit and I have been buying NB shoes for several years now.  I had to pay $7.99 shipping to return the shoes which was a bummer for and item I could not use
This just ruined my new suede shoes :( DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FOR SUEDE
These are very cute and I wanted to love them but I stand on concrete floors all day working retail and these just did not cut it.
Enormous
I like the shoes so I'll put insoles and make it work.
"It's my fault, I'm sure this product is awesome, but I accidentally bought the black thinking it was clear. $130 new beige shoes are ruined and I'm depressed. Picture on can is beige and I guess I was in a hurry when ordering. So make sure you are ordering correctly people.... Time for a glass of wine, sigh...and you know, picture on bottle is very deceptive.... I am actually quite pissed..."
The color was nice but this shoe is way too big on me . I'm going to be returning these.
"its not what I expected,to me it like a cheap t shirt,with spray paint batman on it."
"After I receive the bra I tried it on, it fit well, so I decided to wash it because I always wash new clothes before I wear them.  I washed it on the gentle cycle and when I took it out it was ripped.  What terrible quality."
Fit the need but flimsy
"not exactly silver - IMO, looks more like carburetor grey"
Product is much too small.
Caused major blisters on outside of foot and had to return
Poor quality gum. Not leather
I wear size 10 shoes and they would not stay on.
"These shoes are very pretty. Unfortunately even with thick ankles these shoes are too big. In dress shoes I faithfully wear a sz 9 but these shoes were too big and my foot kept slipping out the back as I walked yet being pushed forward because of the height. Also the right heel had quite a few nicks on it. The heel height measures from the back of the heel 5"", too high for me even with the 1/2"" platform. Being returned.."
It looks ver y chepa
Snaps came apart. Lost straps
"I got these for my wife, recovering from surgery and needing something soft and comfortable. The size medium wouldn't go over her hips, so I ordered the large and extra large thinking that if the medium was s small maybe the large wouldn't be large enough. Well, I could fit in both the L and the XL with her they were SO big. So after trying five pairs of pajama jeans and pajama type Comfy jeans, she still had no pants to wear. Come on Amazon, accurately sizing especially for women will be a HUGE help. This turned her off buying clothes from you altogether! So how about a fix?"
"Are they kidding? The *&^%$#@@! shoe is TWO INCHES shorter and ONE INCH narrower than the size standard! Waste of time and money for everyone. To top it off, I have to drive this junk to a UPS office, probably because the seller is too cheap to include house pickup. They would do better if they had actual sizes and no returns. What a joke...
I took some photos for laughs. Next to the ""Salvatore Exte"" (strange name for Italian, or Chinese...) miniature shoe, amusingly and erroneously marked 13 US, I show an actual 13 US made by Converse.
Here's the best of it: the shoes fit MY WIFE, who is an 11 (women US), which is about a 9 in men.  I understand this is junk with a fake Italian name that will only kast one season: I was fully aware of this when I ordered this ""brand."" But for them to last even a week, I have to be able to put them on.
I say shoo to this shoe."
"Just received the item and am really disappointed! It is very pretty and the wheels spin nicely however my bag had a lock included...just not the key. I am unable to remove the lock to properly close the bag. Also the zippering was very rough...I can imagine problems already. I am sending this back immediately.
PS...has a real strong chemical odor."
"I have dawgs sandals that I love!  However, these golf shoes are not comfortable."
They would've gotten a higher rating but the whole bottom is not white. Its an off-white-tannish color as if they are very old or have been in the sun too long.
"This hat was heavy and uncomfortable, and did not fit my head as well as I had hoped. Not great for summer wear as it didn't breathe at all. I returned it."
A little imperfection in the front of the left shoes
I had to return these because they were to small. They came in a vibram box but were not the quality of the vibram shoes a bought in the past.
"meh...I hang this so called necklace over my lamp...I pull it out if I really want the look it provides...which, oddly enough it will provide...But its  only so ...so....I would not buy it again..."
"Price seemed right, and the glasses are good looking.  Still, the lenses do shift around a little in the frames as other reviewers have noted.  The lenses seem just about as good as something found at Walmart, but I'm not impressed. They fit ok.  I get a slight headache from wearing them - perhaps because of a slight distortion in the lenses?  I can't honestly recommend them and will be returning them."
"ridiculously small, not sure a 10 year old girl in USA could fit into this."
"when I first received this I loved it but it didn't take long to lose it's shine, after 3 times of wearing this necklace it looked as if I bought it years ago"
"It is not the most comfortable shoe, I am disappointed. I only wore them one time and probably won't wear them much."
cheap fell apart
"Propets are well made, sturdy, walking shoes ...which I like but this style was too ""mannish"" for my taste and not wide enough for my feet either."
These are NOT shoes.
Purchased this in an XL because I know it's intended to be tight. I normally wear L-XL tops. This is sooo tight. I just can't wear it comfortably.
Huge. I ordered an XL and the tag says 1XL. Im not a plus size. Im going to write them to see what can be done. Its unwearable and I don't see how the size above large is plus because in that case I should get a 0X right.
"They are horrible. Very poor quality, lenses are very light. And they are bigger than picture indicates."
I return them.
If you don't need arch support you probably will like the shoe.  It also could use more padding in the ball of the foot area.  Liked the looks of the shoe and color.
Runs a lil big
"Don't let the picture fool you--these things are UGLY and HUGE.  ""full coverage"" isn't really what I was expecting from a ""bikini"".  If you like granny panties, go ahead.  I wear an XS or S in victoria secret sizes, and I think I ordered a 6 in these and they fit almost too tight, so hopefully that helps if you're trying to size these out."
"I always get vans because they stand up to abuse for years. This pair however has the rubber separating from the shoe already after a month or less. I don't know if they killed their production values or what, I'll give them one more chance when these shoes fall apart and if the next pair is as poorly constructed I'm going to have to find a new brand."
"the costume was pink not peach, it was labeled a extra large but did not even fit my mother who is a large.  The costume was disappointing and it took forever to get my refund back.  I just had a negative experience when it came to getting my costume."
"Too big, comical. Had no problem with the return and refund. Would have been very cute if they had been a little bit smaller."
"Nice quality, but kind of useless really. Wristwatches will be joining buggy whips soon. They only sell as a fashion gimmic. Yeah, I got suckered into an impulse buy.

With all of the smartphones and other high-tech stuff we carry, why would we need a watch that's not even atomic accurate?..."
"will the shoes is ok  just be sure about the width
but there is 1 thing i didn't like.  i consider it as bad production The edge of the shoe near Shoe string the material is sporadic also under the shoe string  that part is small and always Arched  which make the shoe uncomfortable

i had buy new balance before and it was perfect . but i think the reason of the price of this shoes is down because of the issues i mentioned

and in my case( out side US ) it's hard to return it because the price of shipping will be almost 50$"
"The fabric is very heavy. The skirt sits well, but the blouse is not sewed incorrectly and so stands of on both sides under the breasts (I can see this on the product pictures too, which I oversaw when was buying). In addition, I received violet instead of grey I ordered. In overall would not recommend."
"Returned,  way too big.  Did not fit well at all."
Says small on tag attached but says large on the skirt.
The braclet fits too small but the company's customer service is one of a kind!
the boots is strong but it's a little tight nice pair of work boots
"Sometimes you get what you pay for and in this case that is definitely true. The earrings both look and feel cheap, almost like costume jewelry. If you want something that actually looks nice, look somewhere else."
"belt came without buckle, eventually buckle came"
Just got this the other day and I was a little disappointed with my order. It was cheap looking and I don't trust wearing it out. Have to return it
Not the red I wanted this is like a fusion color
"I love Alegria Mary Jane style, however the patent leather ones seem to be cheaply made compared to the regular leather ones. These opal pebble patent leather shoes were crinkly just out of the box- they looked like the leather would crack very easily. They are a beautiful shoe, very comfortable- I wish the leather was a better quality- now that these are made in China they seem to be of a lesser quality than in the ""olden days"". I have purchased several regular leather ones and am very happy with them- would highly recommend them, but these I sent back. Another thing- I wish Amazon would have separate reviews for the different colors and patent vs regular leather, because the other Alegria Mary Janes would have a 5 star rating instead of a 2 star."
runs too small. you may have to go 2 sizes up. send the shoes back
"WITHIN THREE WEEKS AND ONE WASH...2 OUT OF THE 4 T PRIMA SHIRTS HAD HOLES IN THEM
I WOULD THINK A BUYER OF THIS PRODUCT SHOULD GET A LITTLE MORE USE FORM THE PURCHASE"
"The worst lingerie ever. Forget about the picture, nothing like that."
"I ordered this in the Highlander Pattern, and I feel obligated to inform you about the hats details.

What you may not like:

-The material for the entire top of the cap is only one layer thick, so it may crinkle/collapse in and not hold a nice shape when you wear it. The Condor is double layered in the front to maintain a nice shape. The top of the hat has a low profile, so If you have a prominent, round, forehead and perfectly shaped skull, or a thick head of hair, you might fill it out nicely. I don't.
-No Velcro strip on the back for a name tape.
-Has a Velcro adjustment strap in back, but the size of the hat feels slightly bigger than the Condor.
-The front Velcro patch is 3.5"" wide, which is wider than all the morale patches, so you have leftover loop patch showing on both sides, and looks tacky.
-The seller info said Optics Planet, which I know and trust, but was actually shipped by shopHYDRA. It arrived in 4 days, BUT, in a bubble wrap envelope, and was smashed, wrinkled, and deformed when I got it. (I hate that!!)
Now, the same day I receive it, the seller is still listed as Optics Planet, but now qualifies for Amazon Prime shipping status! Not cool, Amazon.
Bottom Line Opinion-
The Condor operator cap is a much better quality hat for half the price, so wait for them to get this new pattern, and buy that one."
"Feet hurt instantly. Therefore, returned instantly."
Very cheaply made. The bag didn't last me more then 3 weeks with out a big hole forming in it.
Touchscreen feature does not work.
"Not at all as good as I had hoped.  It went flat pretty quickly and had almost no cushion and no arch support after just a few days.  The Acorn brand slippers are way, way better."
"This suit is super-small.  It is a knock-off of the Robin Piccone crochet from Nordstrom, in which I wear a size 6.  I am curvy but do not have a big butt.  I ordered a Medium in this and still looked like a stuffed sausage.  The bottom part is made very small, probably to fit the Asian slimmer, less curvy physique.  Returning this."
"The material this shirt is made from is thin.  I mean, like Old Navy $5 Tee thin.  If that's what you're looking for, this one is a winner.  I just prefer shirts that are heavier cotton because I want them to last more than a year.

Nice logo design though."
"I ordered an XL based on measurements, I normally wear a size 10 in jeans at the GAP. This dress assumes you have tiny boobs or they are way up in your chin. The ""waistband"" was a mere 2"" below the tight arpit. Too bad, the teal color and lightweight fabric and shape would have been lovely."
This watch was tooo small not made for adult it had scratches everywhere you get what you pay for its really cheap
after several wearings  it started to run badly. So dissapointed
They smell even after being washed and they fit small. I buy a 2X because I like shirts loose but these may fit a L.
"Love the shoe & style, but sizing is NOT standard.  Normal ""med"" width Sketchers don't work with the orthotics I must wear in all my footwear.  So, I ordered the ""wide"" ... oh my goodness!  It was much, much too LARGE.  Sorry to say, because the style is soon cute!  Returning them ...."
"Let me start by saying that I usually wear a small to medium (depending on the cut) top and am a 34C .  I had to double check the size tag thinking I had ordered the wrong size.  Unless you are really petite, don't bother (I can't image how small the actual small size must be).  It fits ok right now, but I can tell that after one washing it will be unwearable.  The length is good, but since it is so tight it rolls up at the bottom.  Too bad."
This was not what I expected. It is poorly made.
"This shoe looks very cute but the size of the bottom is to narrow for my feet, I felt half my feet was outside and they are not wide. I had to return it"
"cheap fabric, very odd fit"
"Didn't like fit on shoulders and color/fabric, returned."
"cuts accross and squeezes toes, foot slips down squashing toes into the front of the shoe. Needs a nonslip orthotic. Not very flexible when walking. I have purchased much more comfortable pumps for less. Very disappointing, don't buy."
"Pretty, but I can't wear them  They don't have correct backs; they don't fit on & they have fallen off both times I wore them! Luckily for me, I was at home & didn't lose them, but I really want to wear them out!! The color is sublime, but it doesn't matter if I can't wear them! The seller should check this, & send me new backs "
These are very uncomfortable. The toe seam area is very bulky. I am a hand knitter and circular sock machine knitter of socks and I am very familiar with how machines construct socks. In this company's case they put too much fabric in the seam area. The elasticity of the socks is not comfortable and they do not stay up well. Would not buy again and have not worn more than once.
completely unusable with thicker ties and shirts. such a hassle
"Even though these are petite size, this fact was not noted anywhere in the description.  Also, I am 5'7' and usually hem my pants to ~30"". These pants in large just came to my ankle bones.  The fabric is thin and soft - I suspect nice for sleeping.  But, I have to return them due to sizing."
"They fit great, felt great but ran 20 mins after I had them on....pretty expensive for a 20 min use....I won't buy them again"
"Too tight, too narrow and too short for size 9 regular shoe. Disappointing because I've ordered this brand before. Dont order from Amazon unless you have prime. Return shipping charges apply. Order from Zappos if you cant go to a store.  Also the orange was not bright it was more rust colored."
"My US Army Sgt. Major of my SF gave me a nice one from Beirut, this one's rope sides are half the size & with 5 strands sits lower than my 3 roped sides."
"These are not black but more of a deep purple color. If I wanted purple earrings I would have ordered purple earrings. Having said that they are pretty and I will wear them eventually, but not with the black dress I wanted to wear them with. If you want black, don't buy these."
Yuck! The cheapest quality ever.. Omg I'm Shock at the poor quality .. It's what I would expect at a dollar store. Don't bother! I'll return them if they will do a free return. I hate them!
"Looks a million times better in the pic than it actually it.  Its good enough to wear everyday but NOT for anything 'special'.  Also, its VERY fragile and would need to be hand washed.  Pay more and get a better quality."
The earrings are beautiful....it shows a nice little white box with a blue bow on it that its packaged in but when I opened the package it was in a baby ziploc instead of a nice box with a bow on it.
"It's crap. Granted it was cheap but when I opened it the stones fell off. It wasn't worth sending back, so now my son just playd with it bc he likes to put things on his wrist."
"Very skinny, even though the picture looks like a moderate straight leg."
This runs extremely smal!!!! If you are usually a large don't expect a Xl to fit either! Arms are way to tight you can't move!
Runs too small .Because it ships from china i just don 't bother to send it back its in my closet waiting for the owner.
"disappointed actually.  Jacket is small, and very thin.  I ordered two of them for work and can't wear in the winter time as its too thin, and the advertised item said JJ Perfection , when tag says, MICKEL  and to dry clean.. I don't have time to take these into a dry cleaner.."
"I should have gone through the Carter's store. There are stitches missing in these bodysuits, requiring some repair before I can give them at the baby shower.

The colors are great - but these are not Carter's quality."
was smaller than I thought it would be
"I got the 9.5 and 10.5 figuring at least one would fit, but the 9.5 is WAY too small (painful to walk even a few steps) and the 10.5 is a little big, the 10 i guess would be exact but it wasn't available in the colour i wanted (usually half sizes are a bit redundant but it seems in this style they're needed).

Also it's a bit of a narrow fit, and my feet are quite wide, it's wearable, but not ideal.

The 10.5 actually make a bit of a weird farting noise as i walk is my feet are sweaty, but they might not do that if you get exactly the right size, or maybe if you had long feet that filled the toe.

I wouldn't recommend ordering on line unless you are sure of your size [e.g. already own another colour] or are prepared to fuss around returning them.

The purple is not as impressive as it looked in the picture :(

Overal quality of materials is pretty good from the looks of it, would be a nice shoe if you got the right size and have a narrow foot."
I usually like Fruit of the Loom cotton panties but the quality cotton is very poor and the fit is loose because of the poor quality and weight of the cotton and the elastic band.
"The shoes were beautiful and I loved them. I noticed they were really stiff but shook it off as needing to be broken in. I did so by wearing them to small errands and for a little while around the house. I noticed they are also slippery and were a pain to drive with because my foot would glide off the pedal with these on. I went out to a friends place for a few hours, did nothing strenuous and woke up the next day to swelling and bruising where the opening of the shoe met the top of my foot, even in the same shape of the opening. Also very tender. Not happy at all and really disappointed, these can be dangerous for people as far as slipping and falling or bad circulation. I get it that you may get a few blisters with new shoes, but swelling and bruising is too much. They are also starting to get worn out already after wearing them a few times, notice they aren't very breathable either."
You can barely see the asymmetric design element because of the pattern.
"I returned these after Christmas, picked em up for my wife.  The picture shows full length they barley came to her mid shin.  They were very thin material and poorly made.  These got 2 stars because Amazon made the return process and account crediting super easy/painless this is why I love Amazon!"
"Gapes at the ankle. Received these last minute before my daughter's Homecoming.  We had to fidget with the straps near the ankle so that it didn't look bad.  If the situation had been different, I would have returned them."
Very Cute.. BUT I ordered a bigger size for my daughter because I thought it would fit her for awhile.. But I just tried it on her & its WAY too small. So now its useless. Ugh now I guess next time if I ever do order from them again I'll have to get my product 5 times bigger so it will fit.
I really wanted to like these boots.  They were very comfortable except for the toe box.  It was wearing a sore on the side of my toe to the point that I just couldn't walk in them.  I had to send them back to Amazon.  I must have odd shaped feet or something.  I have tried three different brands and haiven't found a pair that fits yet.
The watch is very nice but the gold color of the face combined with the light color of the handles makes it very difficult to see it. I had to send it back for a refund and purchase another Casio watch that was easier to see.
I ordered my usual ring size 7 buts its small for me otherwise the sizing its good quality also I didn't like the color its dark not like the bright color in the picture and not shinny
I bought one of these a few years ago. It was a great watch but a few weeks ago I got a DROP of water in it to where a little condensation formed on the crystal. I brought it home and blew it right out. The watch still worked when I brought it into the jewelers to send into Lumonix to get cleaned up. The first estimate they gave me was $325. . I asked the jewelers if they were nuts. He called and spoke to his rep and the tech and they dropped the cost to $195 . Why would I pay these when I could get a new for this price. I ask the jeweler if when he met me if it said STUPID across my forehead ? Needless to say I will never buy another Lumonix watch.
Paper thin and the seams were already coming undone.
The seller should have caught this as it had white foam showing right in the top front next to the first lace hole. Too bad too fit seemed great but I lost confidence in long term quality if seller can't catch white foam insulation on a black boot top front and center. I had to return it.
got them washed them and they smelled like chemicals of some sort washed them twice it did not help had to throw them away
"Actual size smaller than anticipated. Cloth material was very stiff, not soft. I returned the item."
"I got these as a gift on Christmas.  Immediately put them on.  Pranced around the house and then played Cards Against Humanity for 4 hours while sitting on my butt.

They are falling apart now. I'm super disappointed. I haven't worm them since 12/25"
It was crap. Save your money.
"These were 120.00 in post, but I was billed 126.00. I usually can go a few years on 120.00 shoes, but these shoes started falling apart within the first month. Don't waste your money!"
These socks out of the package are way too long. I plan on washing and drying them and praying that they will fit me right now they go about 6 inches above where it they should end.
"IT BROKE AFTER A MONTH USE, THEY DIDNT ACCEPT A RETURN OR EXCHANGE.

WASTE OF MONEY."
"The bag itself was too long so mom only wore it a few times.  Mom just wanted enough space to carry her key, but it was overkill!"
"These are not a soft or comfortable as I was hoping for. the arch support is somewhat painful, but could be because I have flat feet. I was just hoping for a comfortable house slipper to wear around...not sure I can wear these for very long."
"Garbage and not authentic ISOTONER. Expensive, what exactly did I pay for? No smartouch anything. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED."
HAD A FUNNY FIT
"I normally wear 3x shirts which usually fit a little loose.
I ordered this shirt in 28/30 wine color.
The shirt has a ""5xl"" tag on it, but it fits like a 1x, maybe a 2x. The material is pretty stretchy and it fit tight."
Got a short sleeve instead of long.
I love the design and fit but the back strings are coming apart and I haven't even got to wear it yet.  I have to invest in fabric binding tape to keep the damage at a minimum.  Very disappointed.
"Size was inappropriate based on the scale it was shown with the product information. Also, the fabric looks good in the picture, but it does not feel like a good quality fabric. I am returning it."
"This garment seems to me to have been designed by someone with no idea of the shape and needs of a woman's body.  There is an area that covers the breasts that is lacy, but there is nothing resembling cups to support them.  I feel like I have been squashed into a tube with lace at both ends.  I need to wear a garment with support because of back problems, and this camisole does, because it is nice and tight, do that.  I was hoping, though, that it would also offer some breast support.  I am not overly buxom (despite wishing it were so) but I hang out over the top of this if I move around very much.
I gave this one star because I star rating was required.  I would have preferred to give it no stars."
"The first image of a shirt is not same as on the second and third image. Please look closely before order it, it is not same material, same quality or same shirt. Be careful."
"The costume itself seemed to run a little large. Except for the boot covers. Now, I have very slim legs, but they wouldn't stretch at all so it was impossible to get them over my feet. They were completely unusable so I was very disappointed with that. The hat arrived very squished and never quite took the shape it was supposed to have. The coin purse also seemed to be malformed and gaped open no matter what I did. The quality was also lacking, which is common for the cheaper Halloween costumes, but I was expecting a ""premium"" costume to be somewhat better made. The costume was cute, but with so many issues, I would not purchase again."
Way too light.  Advertised as heavy and warm.. Very thin.  I will be returning this
Terrible fit!!!! Fabric was disappointing.
"buyer beware, you get what you pay for.  Yes the dress looks beautiful on the computer screen however when we recieved in the mail and opened it was really cheap looking.  I returned it the next day."
"Too Small, I don't like it!!!!!!!"
"The tag indicates the movement is made in Japan and the strap is made in China and it shows.

The mesh band is cheaply made and is locked into the case at an uncomfortable angle for my wrist. It would look better on people with much wider flatter wrists. The clasp is good quality and doesn't look like it will break anytime soon. The case itself is VERY thin and it's very light though made with decent materials. Not what I was expecting from a $100 dollar watch.

The watch face does look very elegant up close. But the thinness of the face would make it look better on a thin flat-wristed man who doesn't care much about quality."
I order size 26 because I have a pair of the exact same pants that I bought 6 months ago at a Lucky. store These were MUCH smaller.
they broke in my purse ....
Not even a 3x
"Cute.  Was a second hand costume,  but the helmet piece was cracked and there was no mention of that from advertisement of the product."
"Be careful when ordering, these were very large both in the toe area and width. I had to send them back and the next lower size was not available."
"Very nice boots, but very small and VERY narrow. Had to return."
I am in the process of widening the front piece. Lets see if that works.
I was only able to wear it one time because it turned brown after that.
The worst dress I have ordered so far and I'm a prime costumer. Not flattering at all was very disappointed didn't wear it gave it away
"I bought a few of these before knowing about any issues.  Be careful not to tug on these in any way.  If you do, prepare for the clasp to release from the necklace fabric."
Bought a s birthday gift for sister- unfortunately her birthday was past the 30 day return policy so when she opened them up recently and they were way off size wise I emailed amazon for a refund but was denied by the seller as it was over the 30 days.  So now I'm out $70 for the green pair- totally upset and would never buy from this seller again.
Terrible sent it back. Too small and cheap looking. Back looks different than from.
"I liked this concept and really wanted this product to work. My daughter only feeds from one side so thought this would allow me to pump the other at the same time she was feeding. The first time I wore it out was for 6 hours. Gave me a blocked duct because it was too tight. I followed the size chart and although the material is stretchy, it didn't work for me. Plugged ducts are no fun."
"Bought that to give as christmas gift to my boyfriend but it looks like something that you buy for a clown costume on halloween, looks so cheap e it's just too shinny.. it looked better in the photos. Will return it."
"Since I only got one pair in the box, but paid for two....?"
"The finish on these items lasted 4days, however beautiful when they arrived."
"Looks cute. Til you put them on, then (as your toes are jutting out of the peep toe of a shoe that's supposed to be your size) you realize that you must be in some sort of mid-evil foot torture device. They squeeze, rub and pinch everywhere! Blisters are sure to form within minutes. These went back ASAP. Even if they were sized correctly, the are incredibly stiff, hard and uncomfortable. Definitely not good for your wedding day as I had hoped! (Unless you're into excruciating pain on your special day)"
Poor quality! I bought it for my husband. He wore it once and the ball that pushes into the hole just popped off! Customer service was good and refunded our money.
Way too small for an overnight bag. More like an XL purse.
made with very cheap material. first and last time i buy CK t-shirts.
Too big and clunky but I kept them.
"although the fit is good and very comfortable, I do not like the color wash (high impact) on these jeans, it's really blotchy.  I didn't really notice until I was trying on clothes in the department store and looking in a 3 way mirror.  hideous."
"It makes your boobs point outward, I don't like it."
Cheaply made. Seam came undone the first time I wore it. I would recommend paying for a higher quality one.
I like the simplicity and style even it comes with canvas wrist band. It also gives fairly accurate time. The problem is the quality of the glass cover which can easily be scratch.
"This is one size fits all for Asians. It has to be. I'm not very fat but i couldn't get the waist past my thighs and they would have definitely been a few inches too short. (5'7"" tall, 40 inch hips for reference.)

Oh well. I like how they look so i cut the legs off and added elastics at the top to use them as extra long leg warmers. The legs fit my legs fine, it's just the waist on this thing is tiny and not very stretchy."
These are terrible earrings. Theyre cheap and the class does not work. I sent them back.
Very narrow toe and the bottom of these are VERY slippery. I almost fell just wan;king around my house. They are cute and affordable though.
"These are a complete joke.  I'm plus sized so I ordered the 2x size which is what I've ordered in other similar products.  These were large enough around the band but they were teeny tiny in the cup area.  I wear a DDD cup, so I am large, but so are many women my size.  IF you are a B cup or below I think these might work for you.  I didn't return these since I bought them on special and didn't want to bother with it, I donated them to a women's shelter.  Don't rely on the band size to translate to a comfortable cup size in these bras."
"Don't like,a waste of money"
I picked up this jacket during a 'Daily Deal'. It is not high quality. The first day I used it the pocket ripped. The zippers are plastic and don't work well. I jacket is very bulky- I was hoping for more of a light fall jacket. You can remove the inner jacket from the outer jacket but when you wear the outer shell it feels very large- too large. If you are looking for a jacket you can do better than this.
handles seem too flimsy. The bag is large which is the best part. the separation inside is Odd but definitely not for me.
The size 11s barely fit my 10.5 feet.  I tried walking in them in my house and they slipped off as I walked.  They were not nearly as comfortable as my Sperrys.  The only purpose I could discern for the large jelly pad in the heel was to make a lout squonking sound as I walked.  Maybe that would go away with time but I wasn't about to risk forty bucks to find out.  I also wet a small section of my slick concrete garage floor and they were much slipperier than the Sperrys which don't slip at all.  Save you money and go the the Sperry outlet store or vendor of your choice and spend half the price for mo betta slippahs.
Incredibly poorly made.
"This item took months to ship and arrive and then arrived with the face totally shattered. I mean, for $4 bucks I guess it was worth the risk. But seriously, what a disappointment."
"These are my 10.5 month old's first pair of sandal sneakers.  We went to the Stride Rite store and had his foot measured for the first time and picked these out.  I love them.  They are cute, look comfy, and my son has been walking more and more since we got them.  There are just a couple of things I think could be better.  The first problem is that the velcro isn't that sticky.  It keeps coming undone.  Another problem is that the tongue seems to shift off the the side a lot.  These things don't bother him the least bit.  He keeps them on all day without complaint.  Tonight he seemed upset when I took them off so he could get in the tub.

Overall I think they could be a little better made for what I paid for them, but I still think they encourage my son to walk, so I'm happy.  Also, no red marks or blisters after the first and second days wearing them.

Update 5-23-13:

After less than a week we had to return these because they made blisters on the tops of his big toes and the velcro would not stay closed at all.  He wore them maybe three times, but they just don't fit his foot right, even though they are a wide width.  Luckily, the Stride Rite store was understanding and issued a refund. I ordered the Stride Rite Tony to replace them and they've been going strong all summer!"
This is probably hands down one of the worst items I ever bought. The straps broke the first day I wore them. I was at work where I am sitting most of the time in front of a computer and 5 hours into wear them the strap broke. It wasn't a bad looking shoe and the size was accurate. It is just extremely poorly made.
This charm was silver coated and changed to a brass color.
"I bought these because my first pair was  PERFECT!!  Wore those for a year and never had a minutes pain, so I ordered these with another pair to have a couple options, but they are way too wide.  I have narrow, thin feet and after wearing these for less than a day I am now covered in sores from them rubbing across the top of my feet.  If you have wide or fat feet these will be great..otherwise stay away!!"
"Fit as expected, fell apart after first wash."
material is cheap...shorter than expected
Advertised as 4XL(us 2xL) is about the size of a large... Returning back
They look great but the fit is awkward... I had to cut off the black legging part that was attached below the cuff line--now they fit better!
"These fit perfectly. However, they are extremely see through. If purchased, I would recommend to wear them with a t-shirt that completely covers your bottom or even a dress."
"too small, well made and quite nice but not the correct size"
"Does not fit like it looks in the picture. I'm 5""11... The arms and waist line are SHORT. Very light weight material."
Very disappointed. Cheaply made. Do Not Buy!
It turned brown after short time
There was way too much room between the strap and the top of my foot- seemingly for a much bigger or fatter foot.  The length was fine.
"Feels like a cheap knock-off of a similar kind of bag from a better manufacturer (Eagle Creek, REI, Osprey, or anything in that class). If you won't use it for extensive travel, and instead will use it as light-duty pack for beach trips or the park, then fine, it'll probably hold up okay.

For anything more, I wouldn't trust it. I've traveled extensively with similar style packs from other manufacturers (mostly Eagle Creek and REI), so I have some experience with how this kind of pack needs to be constructed to hold up over time. This one doesn't meet those standards at all. The fabric is thin, and doesn't feel like it would hold up to even moderate road trip use. I certainly don't think it would survive many trips through airline baggage handling, for example. The straps are also thin, with relatively weak stitching and buckling materials.

The removable daypack is nearly useless as a pack. The shoulder straps are a silly construction of light mesh webbing between thicker fabric edges. Uncomfortable, not durable, and inconvenient (the mesh easily snags on just about anything). The capacity of the removable pack is also quite small (probably a good thing, considering the poor shoulder straps), and there is only one interior organizing pocket.

Overall, can't recommend this pack for anything. For light use, you're better off with a less expensive pack without the bells-and-whistles (hidden shoulder straps, removable daypack). For moderate- to heavy use, or any real traveling, you're better off spending a little more for a better-quality pack from a better manufacturer."
"Pretty, BUT if you look close you see a few Cracked and crooked stones. I received a return...and will return it myself as well.  A few stones have been damaged and are not the same level in the setting (height) with the others.  The TAG was cut off and stuffed under the earring's display in the ""fancy display/gift box"" that also appears not quite new due to general handling wear. MOST IMPORTANTLY though... THE Thick flat ear posts (with 4 edges) and weight (swinging) can make for sensitive (ALMOST IRRITATING) wearing, because the POST ITSELF is not round, it is flat. Hmmmm.  These ARE VERY PRETTY though and I love the cut and size of the stones.  The oblong shape is nice and the clasps are ok ...one is a bit looser than the other, but again they are obviously used.  If you can get a new undamaged pair and have big piercing holes you MIGHT LOVE them!"
really surprised for the price it should have been a better quality.
If you're a size 0 this is the dress for you.
did not look anything like the picture. Returned is right away!
Broken zipper. Cheaply made. Very small. Not worth the postage to send back. Will give to resale shop....or my four year old granddaughter. Gerrie
"Very thin, see-thru material. Very skinny arms. Did not fit. Got the biggest size & couidnt even get my arm in it. I'm a size 10."
"These fit great and work as expected until you start moving. And then they ride up and create this sausage-y tightness mid-thigh (think of putting a rubberband around your thigh and you'll get the picture) because the legs are up too high. And I found this out just by trying them on; I can't imagine it gets any better by wearing them all day. Keep in mind I am pretty athletic at 5'5"" and 120 lbs, so it's not a cause of me being a tad delusional and ordering a size too small."
Size too small.  Order a size up.  Had to return the one I got.
Somewhat wide in the heel. Just not comfortable.
I gave it as a present. Unfortunately the chain broke after the first wear. Sad.
"It's much bulkier than I expected. Because of that, I don't even wear these because I don't like the sizes."
"The foot bed is too slippery , your feet slip n slide around on them, not good quality."
"Well I don't have a thick foot so the straps were not even touching the top of my foot. Pretty pretty shoe. I should have read some more of the comments, because another lady wrote about this too. Bummer."
They were so cute but too small so I had to return them.
"Arrived ripped.  Had to send back.  Only option is a refund, not a replacement.  I'm bummed because I was really looking forward to using these for my trip."
"The bow on the front was not sewn on well and it fell off about an hour after we had been in magic kingdom. The elastic on the legs of the shorts was rough and my granddaughter did not even wear them. She is very thin so it was not that the legs of the shorts were tight on her thighs, they actually were loose, but she took them off and refused to wear them after 5 minutes of having them on"
"My daughter absolutely loved it and couldn't wait to wear it.  Wore it to school today and said her toes were hurting and the width was too narrow...  I ordered a size 2, she is a solid 1.5  .  She will not be wearing them...  very disappointed."
"I'm almost always a medium in everything.  I'm very generically sized.  I'm almost 5'6'' and weigh about 130lbs.  Large boobs, small waist, large butt.  I ordered this in large, and it didn't even come close to fitting. It was tight and super short, and I'm not exceptionally tall.  I'm average.  The sizing is just way off."
"I liked the feel of the socks, however, they are so tight they cut off the circulation at the knee. I even tried pushing them down my legs a little and that didn't work for me either. Can't use them now."
"I have had three pairs of these over the past three years. I LOVED them! So comfortable and found myself wearing them daily. My feet were tanned in the shape of the shoe! Since I loved them so much I decided to purchase them despite the new negative reviews. I'm thankful for free shipping and returns. These in fact have changed. The material is cheaper, they are more narrow and as I walked around the room my foot was being pushed out of the shoe by the toe strap. Too bad Columbia made a change. Next time I find a shoe I really love...I'll buy several to stock up."
"This is cute but the top is WAY too small. Measurements are a 39-29-39 (D cup) I ordered a XL, and the top is so so tiny. If I lift my arms everything will be hanging out. The shorts are okay. I wouldn't recommend if you are even a C cup."
"Terrible quality, wore them once and already a hole."
"The holes in this belt are totally inadequate for the waist size it purports to cover. My husband is a 34-inch waist, so the 32-44 inch belt should be a good fit for him. However, there are not adequate holes to support his waist size. He'd need to gain a lot of weight for the belt to fit him properly. The picture shows the belt in the smallest position possible, and it is still much too large to do its job."
Poor quality and has a metal loop at the bottom... didn't work for my dress at all (mermaid style wedding gown).
"This hoodie is ridiculous in sizing! Too bad, because it's nice and cozy inside."
Too tight. Runs very small
I have to give them as a present... Those underwear didn't fix any 12 old month baby.. but a 6-9 months
"they simply suck, you get what you pay for, they distort the vision and make you dizzy, no good by all means."
returned these as my husband did not like them at all!
Warning! When you cross your feet the metal piece on the shoe will destroy your other shoe. It's sharp and rough around the edges and I have scratches all over the side of my shoe. That is POS design!
"These fell apart after 6 months, came apart from the soul. Look good yet quality is terrible."
"came super small!!! I bought a size bigger just to be safe, and it felt 5 sizes too small"
Cute shoes but they are a lil too narrow. My son has flat feet but most shoes are fine. These were returned the same day we got them bc they're tight.
"I can't actually answer the questions about size and wear because I didn't try them on.  I am sending them right back.  The boots rock side-to-side on a flat surface which does not offer good stability for knees when hiking.  They also do not have a flat inside insole, so I cannot use orthotics.  I wish all shoe descriptions would include what type of last is used.  Look well made."
"Not a super high quality, but that was expected given the price.  But, the sizes run SUPER SMALL, and what appears in the photo to be an elastic waist band really has ZERO give."
"The picture is very misleading. The one I received was plastic! Bad plastic! It looked like something you would get out of a 5 cent machine. Honestly, save your money as this makes me feel scammed and stupid."
"Im not even sure how late I recieved this. At some point I stopped counting the days. When I did finally receive it, the tank was in a generic plastic bag. There were no tags on it and no inner labeling (size tag at neck/wash instructions at inner bottom). Still don't really understand what that was about. Tried it on just to see if for some reason the tank fit so well that despite ALL of the marks against it, I would want to keep it for that reason alone. It was way to small and bunched awkwardly below the breasts. I already had a nursing tank that I purchased from Walmart (Loving Moments) that is the same style and cut. It was a quarter of the price and manufactured exponentially better than this one. Save your money and go elsewhere."
"I ordered these shoes because of the reviews and because they were, well, cheap....
All I can say is you get what you pay for. First of all, they did fit and were fairly comfortable. However, within the first hour of wearing them, the plastic insole had ripped in two places. Everything my foot touched caused this plastic to split. I was not kicking things or scuffling my feet. They looked awful after one day at work. I am too embarrassed to wear them again. By the way, I work with someone who ordered two pair of these shoes in different colors. She said that hers did the same thing. One day and they were toast.  My advice would be to spend another $10 or $15 and get some decent sandals that will at least get you through the summer."
"Very cute.  But very thin material and I got the largest size and it was still to small.  I'm 5'8"" and 165lb. Slit in dress was not meant for women with hips.  Slit opened from my front inner thigh to mid butt cheek which isn't very public appropriate"
Didn't look like the pic. Sent it back.
"Beware, you DO NOT receive the designs and patterns pictured.  We were sent three pair of solid white, a solid blue, a solid purple, and one pair with a design, but it's an ugly one which isn't even shown.  Nothing aggravates me more than sellers who advertise one thing and send something entirely different.

Beyond that, the underwear run small, are flimsy, and aren't worth the money you pay for them."
"I'm a 42C- fairly firm- but these are just too much nothing. I bought the 2X- and the band is comfortable. There's tons of nipple show through, and no support.  I might as well be wearing a fabric halter top- that would have about the same level of support.  I bought these on sale, and they were cheap, but I can't see what use they'll be to me.  I guess if you want a bra that doesn't do much, this would be for you.  It might be ok to sleep in- but I don't sleep in a bra.  I'll be sending these back."
For those of you who actually need arch support (I wear orthotics in most of my regular shoes) I don't think the arch support in these was sufficient.  they were cut a bit too small as well
"VERY upset with this purchase. Looked for big and tall and thought this print looked great. Sadly when I received it, it was NOT meant for big and tall. Way too tight first time I wore it. Feels cheap and thin as well. Very unfortunate.  if you're XXL, DO NOT GET THIS SHIRT. it's bulls***"
"Not as pictured, look more like capris and the leg is very wide."
"Not great. Cheap price, but you get what you pay for. Chest area/arm pits are unusually big and wide, but the rest of the shirt fits fine. The bottom seam is coming apart after one wash. I like the color and how cool it kept me while working out, so the poor quality is a shame."
"So much shorter than it says, def not knee length. I'm 5'8"" so I expected it to be shorter, but not as short as it actually ended up being. It ended up being mid-thigh length."
Cute for a costume. Be ready to wear them all the way extended because the metal clasp that should tighten them up doesn't actually work.
"Loved the design of this shirt, but it was too small and I had to send it back."
"It just looks nothing like the photo, it is so misleading and disappointing. I feel bad leaving one star but, it was awful."
"I sent these sandals back because they are so  heavy and uncomfortable.  Normally, I adore Born shoes and sandals but these were a big disappointment."
It's minimal bounce which is great for us big breasted girls but after a while the straps lose their velcro-y ness and you have to twist them around itself to make them tight.
Too large. Hot.
I thought it's a sweater which is what I have been looking for. but it's not.
kind of lack luster
Let me first start with I love this bra and how it fits! However major down fall is that the bra tears at the cup I have purchased 5 of these bras and all of them do the same thing. For the price that's ridiculous!
Worst wallet ever. Got it as a Christmas present in one day the button broke off.
"Item was too large and not cost efficient to return.  Needs to be less flimsy material. If have narrower head go down size.  Don't assume, as here, that high school senior needs large."
Too long.  30 in feels like 31 in.
"I wouldve liked to love this. But for $16 this is not worth it. I wouldnt call this a bargain. The tulle is literally tied around an elastic band and cheaply slopped a bow on the front. It also fit pretty darn tight. I will say the onesie was cute, seemed to be of decent quality but a little big, especially around the collar. I will be returning this because of the tutu and sizing incompatibility. "
"The shirt came from China so the sizes are VERY off. I ordered a 5x,I got it but in China a 5x is like an American medium!"
Looked cheap and on a plus size person it's a big no ! I bought this for my mother and she looked so much bigger ! Returned !
After putting them on the first time felt comfortable and supportive. Trying them out walking around the house have the first signs that if have issues... Blisters on back of heels and pinkie toes. Needless to say returned them.
I liked the dress but it was too long and a little snug. It sits in the closet. It is very pretty but doesn't quite work for me.
these were not for me too big too wide and not very comfortable
Not good
These run incredibly small!
I bought this bra - still have all the tags on the but I can't return them as I waited too long (I was in and out of town) anyhow they were too small for me.
"I am so disappointed! I ordered this hat in the grapefruit color for a trip to Central America. I paid extra for over night shipping. The hat that arrived is dark purple, I don't have time to return it and get what I actually wanted. Super cute hat but it's the wrong color!!"
"I expected a decent weight material as these are sweatpants.  The material is very thin, unlike most sweatpants."
"Dress is a beautiful color,  very long,  hemmed up well. The decorations had to be glued down they  were lifting up. They didn't stay glued down though seemed to be cheaply made. Somewhat disappointed in the quality."
Loved it when it arrived.  Now the corner is already tearing.
Terrible! Do not order. They are going back!!!!
I am not a fan of the silky material.  I tend to sweat a lot in these and start to stink.
"These didn't work out well for me, the didn't stay up securely and there's very little silicone to hold them up.  They aren't very durable either.  I ended up buying a better pair for my wedding. They look nice though."
Paint came off in 2 weeks
"I love my new shoes!  Very comfortable. I didn't notice the white buckle in the pics of the shoes. I got lots of compliments at work when I paired the black jelly platform with black and white skirt. Cute and fun shoes. Follow-up:  I bought these last summer.  I forgot how cute these are.  I deciced to get more wear this year after only wearing them once last year.  I don't walk much at work, but I started to notice a slight ""click"" when I walked to the coffee bar.  No worries.  I removed one shoe when I returned to my desk and discovered the side separating from the base.  I inspected the other shoe to find more damage.  Not sure if I can save these even with a glue gun.  Too bad. :("
"I don't know what Liputian made these, but they most certainly run small and narrow.  I ordered a size 8.5 EE and received something that wouldn't fit a small child."
"The sales transition from the buyer was great however am not impressed with the bra itself.  I have regular bras that are more comfortable. I find it hard to put on because it rolls up, flattens the breast, bottom tends to ride up while wearing it and nipple shows through clothing such as t-shirts.  I am not a large person, wear a size 8 clothing and size 34C bra.  I bought the medium which is actually too small.  The only use I could see anyone using this bra for is to use as a sports bra and I would still choose a cotton sports bra over this product.

I would not recommend this bra for anyone."
broke after two uses  right down the center
"I ordered this as a gift for someone who's a Potter fanatic and I must say, those who left glowing reviews must've received something entirely different than what I did.  The box is nice, the packaging is impressive looking, but the wand itself looks NOTHING like the one in the photo - the one I recieved was tan colored - not brown at all.  The thing looks like a butterscotch stick with a little stain slapped on here and there (very little stain, this thing is 95% just plain tan-colored).  Worse still, it has a big trademark logo and lettering inked onto the wand itself that cannot be removed - it's printed along the wand near the handle and is VERY noticable.  Worse still, as others have stated, this wand feels extremely fragile; almost like it's made out of glass, not resin.  I was actually scared I'd break it getting it in and out of the box - this wand will not hold up to much of any handling.  The reviews of children playing with them or casting spells with them must've recieved something very different.  I guarantee you, if the wand I recieved was waved back and forth like a conductor's baton, it would snap off at the handle in very quickly.

VERY unimpressed and disappointed in this product, especially for the money spent.  I didn't have time to return it and ask for one that actually was brown, so, that's my experience.  This thing is a piece of junk."
"The top fit very good, the pants not good at all. There is no way in the description that said the pants is a low rise, hate the pants. The only reason I did not returned it, is that i needed it fast. The material is inferior, the only reason it received a 2 is for the top.  Would not recommend this product."
"Out of all of the products that I have ordered over the last decade, I have received all of them except this one. What a coincedence"
This fit really weird.  I wouldn't buy anything like this online again.  Personally I think buying clothes is a hit or miss online.
Was excited to get it fast but sadly had to return it cause it did not fit what so ever. I got the XL (I'm a 38dd) & my boob didn't fit at all. Ugh
"The quality of this bag was really bad.  The first (and only time) I used it, it ripped out 12"" on both of the bottom seams--on the first leg of a three-stop trip.  Thank goodness I'd packed things inside a garbage bag inside this bag in order to keep them dry,otherwise I'd have had belongings falling out all over the place!  I had to duct tape the bag together to get my stuff home.  SUPER poor quality.  I've requested a refund, so hopefully that will go through fine.  But my advice is to avoid this bag and buy something that won't rip out the very first time you use it."
Awkward. Large in some areas(middle of foot and toe area) small feeling In Others. Cheap looking and uncomfortable.
"These shoes were awful!  My main complaint is there was hardly any upper leather on the shoe - it was as if part of the shoe was missing.  When I tried the shoe on, most of my foot hung over the side of the shoe because there was very little leather to cover the upper portion of my foot.  A real cheap shoe.  I should have know better than to buy this shoe - $29.00 - you get what you pay for."
"These Bali bras that I got are NO WHERE near the quality of all 30 previous purchases of Bali bras.  These 2 bras were cheap material, cheap plastic connector's on straps that rub and irritate, and the fit is Nothing like all of my other Bali Passion for Comfort bras.  Maybe because they were manufactured in Honduras-???? Who knows?!?  But the fact is that these last two the quality was Very Very Poor-will never purchase these online again.  Will go into Bali store to ensure the quality that I am used to for the money that I pay."
"The only reason I give this 2 stars is for Amazon.com's Excellent Customer Service (as always).  The belt looks nice, has a quality name, but is POORLY made.  Mistakes in automated manufacturing happen, I understand that, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and opted for an exchange.  Same defect (rivets not properly secured) on the same portion of the belt twice...  That's enough for me.  Why should I waste my time and Amazon.com's money to keep returning inferior items?  I have requested a refund and will not purchase another Columbia branded belt again.

If you decide to purchase this item, I hope you have a better experience than I had."
Stitching on left strap around U-shaped piping was noticeably different to the point that they may be defectives or seconds.  I have bought several pair of this style Sanuk over the years from various retailers without issue.  These are very comfortable but had to return this purchase.
Way too small and fabric seems super cheap but doesn't matter since it doesn't fit
So inexpensively made of inexpensive materials it did not have the quality of even a CVS reader.
"You wouldn't believe how long these things are.  I'm over 5'8"" and the waste band comes up to chest. The waist is easily as wide as my shoulders.  You'd have to be at least 7 foot to wear these.  Absolutely surreal the size of these things.  The tag says extra large, just like my last pair, but...
Just look at the picture"
"Vestal has some nice thoughts about watch design that just fall flat on their face. This is just another of their overly heavy, badly executed designs. The hands are just as much of a failure as several of their other ones like the ""Constrictor?"" No lume on an hour hand is just plain stupid. Chronograph complications are also just unnecessary imho."
"This top has no stretch to it.  I have many scrubs in the same size, but this one doesn't allow me to move around comfortably.  It feels too stiff."
"I give this two stars, as I am not thrilled with this romper.  First of all, I ordered the white.  It's not white at all.  It's more of a dirty-white/ light grey.  It looks as if it's been washed with a darker color that bled, or you just can't afford to do laundry.  I'm 5 '5, 115 lbs and ordered the small.  The shorts are WAY too baggy, and don't look good at all.  It is pretty comfy, so I give it 2 stars for that only."
Ran smaller than described.
did not like these shoes.  they felt a little short in length.  also they looked ugly like a cross between a corrective shoe and baseball cleats.  not cute.  really did look like golf shoes an old man might wear.  i returned them immediately
very cheap not what i thought it would be like. o well better luck next time for me a a
"These socks say they are ""cushion"" crew socks. I'm still looking for the ""cushion"". Maybe if I wear two pairs at a time I might have some cushion. These socks are thin, rough and not comfortable. I have bought these before last year and they were good socks. Don't know what happened but these will be used for rags."
"My daughter really loved these boots, they fit well and were comfortable. But the zipper broke after two months. :("
battery died in 5 days after getting it. Felt extremely cheap. I got what I paid for and returned for my money back
"I should have read reviews before I bought. Ten pairs, as soon as I washed them, they went a size smaller. I tried them on first, PERFECT. I know cotton shrinks, but its been years since something I bought shrunk after I washed it. BOO! Now I will have to buy more at a larger size. Not happy!"
No...just no. Way way too small. I'm very disappointed:(
Not what I had expected. The area (flaps) above the zipper are huge and stick straight up. I'm returning the item bc this is not what at all the size or shape I was expexting.
"The edges are frayed like this was just a pair of shredded rights, all torn apart with loose threads everywhere.  Its completely unwearable"
"Adorable costume and seems to be well-made (I didn't test it in the wash), but the sizing is way off! I ordered the 18-24 months one for my tall 15-month-old and, right out of the box, it looked too short. The width is right but the length is ridiculously short.
I compared it to her 18 month sized Carter's onesies and it's shorter by a lot, then compared it to the 12 month ones and it's still shorter!
I used the size chart so this is unacceptable. Very disappointed."
Ordered 2 sizes bigger than i normally wear and it's still too small can't return so if you buy beware you will be stuck with this item
When the box came I new immediately that it was going back. I don't think the jacked weighs 8 oz. I thought this was a much heavier weight. I did not even bother to take it out of the bag and try it on. I think it must have had tissue paper for a lining.
"Disappointed, too small to hold my phone and billfold."
No this is different i have 2 other French toast long sleeves this is so long i have to return
The colors are vibrant but this outfit is an epic fail ...I can't even walk in the shirt it's so tight down the bottom like a mermaid suit or something
The taper was so big I couldn't get them in.
"item not as described, returned"
If there was no stars I would give it that; it  looks ok but the material is wide for larger women it looks horrible at the bottom this shirt is only for sizes 0-4 don't buy if you are a women size 8 n up stay away I cut mine to redesign  otherwise it looks like a printed trash bag complete waste of money totally regret will use for a dish rag
"This dress came quickly and fits well. It was cute and flattering. However, not enough padding to keep me in the top of the dress.  I also thought the bottom of the dress would flare more, but it doesn't. It wasn't the right kind of material to do so. Also, the little sleeves wouldn't stay in place kept rolling down as the dress had no support. I really wanted to keep this dress. Returning it and still searching for the perfect dress."
Runs a bit smaller than I thought it would be.
"This is the worse costume ever! If I'd been as slim as the model it may have worked, and I even went up a size but  looked like a dumpling in it!

 I'm 5 feet tall, ordered a large, normally wear sizes from 8-12.

I ended up just using the cape in addition to what I scrounged around at the last minute, and gave a 10 year old child the rest. Only reason not returning it is because it was worn."
"I went to the store and this guy sells me all these inserts, two pairs of shoes (I purchased these black ones online because they were out at the store), and all my foot problems were going to be solved.  After 4 months of limping around on the shoes with the inserts I went to the doctor - who immediately told me to throw away the inserts, go back to wearing regular shoes, and you'll be fine.  A week later I was back running at the gym."
Nice shoe but though i have ordered same size hush puppy in the past these were much too narrow.
"A huge lesson in ""you get what you pay for"" the tiny black beads feel like plastic and the elastic it was on snapped and broke the first day. Poorly made."
"Well constructed and fit properly, however it wrinkled so badly I couldn't use it for the intended purpose. I bought the shirt in a bright color to look cheerful in travel photographs. It does not travel well, and in the pictures it looks like it's made of paper."
"I've worn a lot of Propets. With this one, the heels have no padding and rub up and down when I walk. Fixing that with heel protectors resulted in toe discomfort. I think overall these are not quite true to size, esp. for someone without your own heel padding, so to speak."
"Ugly, fits weird, all over I'd never wear it.  No way.  Thank God it was relatively inexpensive"
Followed up after being washed one time. Also it fit but I got asked if I was buying an a lot so maybe a little too long because I do not have a belly
Keeps bad time. Always loses about 2 hours no matter how many times that I reset it.
Returned. My foot fit in the shoe but the top of the shoe pushed down really hard on my foot and squashed it. I took them off within one minute of trying them on and back they go. Dissappointed in Merrell. This is the 2nd Merrell pair I'm returning today.
"Could have been a great shoe, but SQUEAKS like you would not believe. The materials and design used for the footbed liner result in very, very loud squeaking with every step. I tried adding paper towels or thin fabric between the insert and the footbed. This did reduce the squeaking somewhat, but it was still too loud. Ended up returning the shoes.

UPDATE 2018-JUNE
Picked up another pair at a local store, thinking the squeaking issue may have been due to a defect with the first pair. Nope, the new pair from the local store had the exact same problem. If anything, the squeaking was worse. Had to return those as well."
"A little smaller than my similar Condor and Fox Outdoor hats. A little tight on me. I think my head circumference is just under 23 1/2 inches which should put me inside the upper end of the ""one size fits most"" range. I ended up returning the hat after looking in the mirror. I just happened to turn my hat backwards to look at the back and noticed that the long Velcro strip on the back wasn't straight and looked ridiculous."
"I ordered 3 of these and ended up returning all of them.  If buying for a narrow foot, do yourself a favor and go with another brand.  My 3 year old has very delicate and narrow feet, I ordered the regular/narrow not the wide and it's still so wide. It looks and fits terribly."
"I never even tried it on. The heel is made with plastic and it looks just like plastic. I also did not like the brand of shoe. If the brand of the shoe had been in the product details, I would have never ordered it in the first place. They are just really cheap looking shoes. I passed on them."
"I would have loved this if the size was more true.  I normally wear a small, ordered a medium and should have got a large.  I've already worn it so can't return it.  If you get one you should order at least a size larger than normal."
"After the first wash, the elasticity was stretched. I could hardly keep them up."
Cheap thin material. Have to wear a tank top under it. HATE IT!
"Look like Walmart ""Rustler"" Wranglers, very redneck. They are supposed to be slim but are so gathered at waist and balloon around hips and thighs. Very disappointed in Wrangler brand, but it's almost like these are some knock-off, copy cat brand like Rustler, re-labeled as Wrangler. Would not recommend."
I was really wanting to love this necklace but it's extremely overpriced for the product you get! I will definitely be returning it.
"These gloves are supposed to be for 7-9 year old children. My daughter is a very tall 7 year old girls, and the gloves were waaay too big. They almost fit me, and I'm an adult. They look cute, but the size is way off."
The shoes are very Hard and unconftable.
"This top is really cute on but the dye comes off on your skin ALOT if you sweat in it.  I wore this for about two hours outside on a humid day.  When I got home and took the top off my skin was blue around the chest and neck area where it touched the skin.  I showered with different scrubs and soaps three times which got most of it off.  I washed the top in a white plastic basin for dishes...I rinsed it and dumped the water out at least twenty times before it just left a pale tint in the water.  After hanging the top to dry it is a lot paler color, but still attractive.  I have other colors in this top...all bled some onto the skin...but this color was the worst.  The other tops I washed and rinsed by hand only had to be rinsed about three times to get most of the runniness out of them.  These tops do hold up well, and if you hand wash and hang to dry they don't shrink.  I would definitely recommend washing before wearing!"
"If you are going to wear wingtips, they ought to be of classic proportions. The toe box on these shoes is slightly widened--not so badly to the point of a box toe, but noticeably so that it detracts significantly from the sleekness of the toe. If you compare the toe from the superior view to a very classic oxford, you'll notice that it is less round. This gives the shoe a ""clunkiness."" This is, of course, incredibly subjective and I know that Rockport prizes comfort. Just writing incase there are any other buyers out there who care about such details."
"Color came a dark mustard yellow, too big and too sheer like panty hose"
Poor quality & horrible fit. Doesn't fit on my (adult) head or on my kids' heads as its not deep enough so just falls off. Can only use as a hand puppet. Waste of $ (& it wasn't cheap!!). Assuming the other positive reviewers were friends and family of the vendor.
"sizing was small, material was lousy, fit was horrible. May be fine for less chesty mamas, but it was a horrible bust for me."
"My jacket came with some really gross looking brown spots on the lining, and I immediately started breaking out in hives after I took it off,
so i'm sure it was mold. Other issue was it was completely crushed up and wrinkled from the packaging.  What can you do with faux leather with wrinkles?  I have to return, very disappointed."
"Nice style, but beware...although listed with women's shoes, these are MEN'S SIZES.
I ordered an 8.5 (womens), and ended up receiving an 8.5 MENS, so a 10 in womens. So only 2 stars."
"Too big but my chief frustration is that I just can't get the wrinkle out when I opened the mailer pack?
Helpful suggestions welcome"
"I was very disappointed because it didn""y look as nice as the picture"
This shirt is very short when it arrives. You get what you pay for!
I haven't even had these shoes for 2 months yet.  The suede on the top of the shoe is rubbing off and looks very worn already.  The soles are already wearing down. I'm very unhappy with them.  I have a similar pair that has lasted 3 years!
"Arrived in a timely matter, but not as pictured or described.  Came in a bright neon orange color, not the nice pumpkin gold as shown.  Also, runs small.  Disappointing.  Had to return it."
"Felt cheap, returned."
"Washed first time, shirt shrunk!"
"Poor quality. This is the second pair of these shoes that I have owned. The first pair was absolutely on of the best pair of dress slip-ons that I have ever owned; perfect fit, high quality, long-wearing shoe purchased directly from Dockers. This pair is a sloppy fit and have not worn well. The fake leather upper starting fraying at the edges after a few months, the stitching is awful and the show just has an overall look of low quality. Docker either drastically changed their materials and manufacturing processes or this pair of shoes was a cheap Chinese knock-off. I have replaced them with Clarks Bostonians."
"This would make a nice summer hat to wear in Antarctica
It is polyester with a polyester lining and what looks and feels like a silicone coated polyester imitation linen shell.
This has the same breath-ability as my gills at a thousand feet below sea level.
I think you would be more satisfied if you took your ten bucks, bought a cold pint of beer and poured it on top of your head in the sunshine."
"I purchased these for my wife, in short they where to small, like two sizes to small.  They would not exchange them, had to spend another 40 bucks to send them back, there went all the savings.  If you are going to buy this boot order them big.  Will not order from them again."
"Imagine a set of amorphous memory foam mattresses slapped loosely under your feet and covered in cheap polyester fleece-- impossible to stand upright, let alone to walk around in. And not even the tolerable type of memory foam! I would give them to my puppy to chew, so they might serve a purpose but the materials are surely toxic. Acorn used to design slippers, but these are just awful sloppy sloppers. Booooo!"
"I like the look,size,color, but had yellow stripe of paper, looking closer found a cut<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scala-Men-s-Dress-Straw-1-Piece-10-11Mm-Laichow-Braid-Boater-Hat/dp/B002NSM3Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scala Men's Dress Straw 1 Piece 10/11Mm Laichow Braid Boater Hat</a>,defect, to return it..order another one?(no exchange), 4 dollar more would think about it.."
"Heavy duty boots however I ordered a 1/2 size larger than my normal but could not budge them on , they run way too small made in china maybe thats why  order way bigger than  u would think !"
"Very tiny and returned immediately for credit. No problem returning either, I appreciate it."
"THEY LOOK CHEAP, BUT I DIDNT WANT TO GO THROUGH THE BOTHER OF RETURNING THEM.  PROVES THAT WITH JEWELRY YOU REALLY MUST SEE THE PHYSICAL ITEM."
I personally did not like these because they did not come with instructions on how to put them on and the snapped at the first con i went to. The best thing to do for the Attack on Titan belts and harness system is make it your self with elastic rather then pay for pleather straps that will break if you tighten them to tight.
They were too narrow at the widest point of the foot.
About half of the non-skid rubber treads came off within 3 weeks.  We have wood floors so these socks aren't very useful.
These shoes smell terrible.  They small of a very strong chemical which fresh air and Febreeze have not lightened. Strongly recommend you stay away from these shoes.
"Very nice pants but far from an American size xsmall, small or med. They are more like a girls size 10. Cute, but not for an adult unless you are under 100 lbs."
"Very thin material, and a back seam ripped the first time I wore it. I even bought a size up. Too bad, the cut was cute, and material was very soft. But I haven't ripped denim on purpose since the 80s, and don't plan to start now."
"First of all they run small.  I have size 11 feet and am a little used to having to wear shoes that are too small.  I found them comfortable enough, if I wore them with thin socks.  The problem is that one of the zippers separated after wearing them only half a dozen times or so.  Though they are stylish, the workmanship is very poor!  I would stay away from these as I see lots of people have the same problem.  They ended up being wasted money as I can't get the zipper to re-engage."
"It's pretty, but the dress looks cheaply made, and is very sheer. It did not come with a belt. Will pribably fit a size 0-2 woman."
Developed holes after my first wash. Had to donate it already.
Did not fit whatso ever!
Not as comfy as advertised.
"I bought these for my son because they are supposed to be so ergonomic, but every time my son wears them his little feet smell.  I constantly wash his feet and the shoes, but  it continues to happen.

We also have crocs and some cheap flip flops; his feet have never smelled before.

Also, it looks like the ribbons are two colors in the picture, light and dark blue, on a blue-grey colored shoe, but when I got them , there was no dark blue color; it is all blue-grey.  I know it is minor, but I was disappointed."
These are at best worth $5 gas station grade shades but I wanted the style with polarized lenses. The frame doesn't fit completely comfortable with the size of my head. These are spring loaded but the metal is very flimsy.
Unbelievably too small
No where near plus sizes. Get some real plus sizes up here and stop false advertising
"even though they're a great price, and they're very warm they are sooo god damn see through and as soon as i bent over the bum split. save your money."
Very uncomfortable and the straps cut into my feet.
"Didn't care for the springwater. Compared to my ""reef star cushion"" and ""Sanuk yoga "", these are way to stiff. These were sent back."
"2.5/5

Pros:
- I got 48 beads when it said I'd be getting 45
- Came with a free small binder ring

Cons:
- Beads are actually a much paler pink (practically clear), they are put on a pink string to make them look a like a more vibrant pink than they actually are.
- I don't believe these are a real gemstone, they look like they were made in a mold (there's one of those lines going around it that you'd get from two half sphere molds pressed together)"
"they was too small I am a size  6 in regular legging but down are like for  women with size o
mean if you have a little of button do not order , any how I do not believe in one size fix all"
"This was obviously a man's size.  I gave it to my husband  It was not just ""Too large"" it was WAY WAY TOO LARGE!!!"
Seemed like a great deal for the price but pilled like crazy in the very first wash.  Not worth it--even for 10 bucks.
This sucks - these used to be the best leggings.  I shopped around and then gave up and came back to them and now they are see-through and much cheaper feeling.  Too bad!  go back to the higher quality material but I don't know if I'll buy again soon.
"I really like the way they look. But after literally 2 uses they are coming apart. DO NOT buy these if you plan on walking in them. And if you're not going to be walking, maybe you should just stick with socks.

One star for looks and warmth. -4 stars for functionality."
they fit like gloves not bc i got the smaller size- they are my size but I don't like my dress to show all my contours and this dress is designed that way.
"Length is okay but toes are snug and the shoe is too wide and loose around the ankle.  The metal makes an annoying jingling sound when you walk that can only be described as ""spur like""."
"Smaller than I'd like.soft leather but smelled horrible..like car emissions.delivery was fast but probably won't order from there again, primarily because if the stench..after 2 Weeks if use the purse is already showing signs of serious wear."
The canvas is very cheap looking.
Too large it should be large not xl
"The synthetic leather on those boots looked very cheap to me, and they were stiff and tight.  I have narrow feet but found them to be tight across the top of the foot and pretty uncomfortable."
"It's true to size and fits perfectly, but it is very uncomfortable without extra padded inserts due to it being hard on the inside.
I would suggest paying a little more for something better or if you get this, buy dual padding insoles at your local store"
"Nice material but you get what you pay for.  I washed on gentle/cold, dried on low and wow did this shrink.  Had to throw this in the donation pile.  But it was 10 dollars so I should've known.  Normally I wear a small but bought medium so maybe you want to go up a couple of sizes."
Did not fit my needs.
"Looking very good ,very comfortable also... but they actually ripped off at the first time use( in about one hour of use)......"
Its just a bit too small which causes a lot of problems.  The clear slot for your IDs isn't deep enough so your cards stick out a little. Throughout the day they come out more and more.  The other card slots are also too small and are very hard to get out.
"This ""wide width"" sneaker is actually more narrow than some medium width sneakers I tried on."
Size is good but it does look cheap and nothing like leather.
"This top fits nicely, but unfortunately the material is cheap and the first day of wear pilled.  After one wash, the material bled.  I cannot recommend to purchase."
The calf area was too small but the foot fitted well.
Looses color fast
"cheap, won't stay on, fits horribly"
"Loved the bra but the piece you adjust the strap with is thin plastic.....it broke when adjusting the strap, I would not reccomend this bra."
The quality of the elastic band is really bad. It's not even a few weeks since I got it and the elastic threads are already coming out.
"Sizing is not accurate, i ordered the smallest and i try to wear it seems like it is XL on me"
Too small!!! An XL isn't really an XL!!  I wear XL shirts and the vest is too tight / not long enough. Waste of money
"Very pretty earrings but the backs don't stayed screwed on. I bought these for my two year old daughter who has her ears pierced since she was 12 weeks and the back to one of the earrings wouldn't stay screwed on. We lost the back within days of her wearing the earrings. The company was very nice and sent replacement backs. Sadly, we experienced the same issue with the backs."
Very dissapointed for the prices. I am a small girl and these still didn't reach my elbows. They were almost 3 inches below that. If these were cheap party gloves or a costume accessory I would be more understanding. Now I have to buy new ones.
I purchased these socks thinking they would fit on my feet but they didn't.  I was really shocked when I tried to wear them and the pair of socks barely fit over my feet.  Looking at the picture it looks like the socks would at least fit near your calf muscle but these socks did not.  I was glad that I requested a refund and received it electronically it.
"Didn't fit very well, didn't last very long, but I expected that"
"I was sorely disappointed in this item. Bought a large according to the size chart. It was HUGE!! The fabric was flimsy, legs were 12"" too long. The wrap top had A LOT of fabric. Returned."
"I get dry hands, dry cuticles. I am always looking for a therapy to help me not have so many hangnails, and rips.  Crabtree &Evelyn Nail and Cuticle Therapy smells like a pine tree to me, which is not pleasant. It absorbed quickly and left my cuticles soft which is what it is supposed to do but I get that from plain old cheap coconut oil."
Contemplating sending it back.  The material isn't as nice as I had hoped and it arrived covered in chalk marks from the dress makers.  They didn't even bother to clean it before sending it out.  The dress fits great through the bodice it's the sleeves that are stupidly small.  If I do keep it I am going to have to take it to an alterations shop and have the sleeve removed.  For a dress that costs this much I expected better.
"I wish I'd never bought this purse. Yes, the painting is lovely (I got Karmic Koi), and the leather is soft, but I wish I had paid attention to a reviewer that said this clasp was horrible. I think she may have been being nice. The clasp has no hold at all. At first, I thought I was putting too much in the purse, causing it to ""burst"" open. So, I stopped carrying a hair brush. Still burst open, and spilled things on the floor, or in my car, or at the store. I stopped carrying my cell phone in there. I stopped carrying my wallet (keep my atm card with my cell phone). Now, I have a lovely art piece on my shoulder that can't actually act as a purse. I wish I'd sent it back right away and gotten a different one. I figured I could make it work with magnets, but the clasp isn't steel, so magnets don't work. I've toyed with creating some sort of loop toggle, so that even when the clasp flips open, it won't actually pop open and spill my stuff. If I had any stuff in there. Can I make it work? Probably. But honestly, for this amount of money, I was expecting something I wouldn't have to jury rig in order to make it work for its intended function."
"I cannot believe I spent $50 for something so obviously cheap. Everything that you see and touch about this unit is plastic. It may work and work well.and if it does, I'll amend my review. But I am not optimistic. And the only reason I am not sending it back is because I doubt if anything I could buy for twice as much would be of better quality."
"Looks good from a distance,  but the material is cheap: dots are actually painted on it. The cut is ok, too, but my expectation is for the white dots to start cracking after the first wash and then this dress will go to trash."
"runs small, looks nice tho"
I returned these shoes because they weren't as advertised.
These shoes were very stiff and uncomfortable. I have narrow feet and they were still tight on the sides. I got blisters almost right away and ended up just getting rid of them.
"Really, really, really small. They look well made, but small. I figured people were exaggerating, but no...really small."
Fits very small. Only purchase if you have super narrow feet.
"I wear a size 11. When I first got these they were maybe a half size too big. Less than a week later and they dropped 2 sizes and no longer fit. If you do order get 2 sizes larger than you normally wear, leave them outside a few days and they should fit or just make it easy and pick another shoe."
"This was very pretty, but the material - particularly the lace/trim - was VERY scratchy and uncomfortable. It was very flattering and did look great, but I couldn't stand the feel of it, even for the limited amount of time I intended to wear it."
"Okay. If I could give these less than one star I would. They are advertised as gray but they are literally dark silver glitter. Which is fine...if you're going for the magic mike stripper look, which for our wedding my fiance was definitely not looking for. Can't even find the damn things to return. But yeah don't buy these unless you want to be the disco ball of the party."
Yo big for 51mm
way too tiny.
A little sloppy looking and cheap. Maybe it was my body type but I had to return it. Worth a try with the free shipping.
"These shoes were bulky. I bought these for a 3 year old but I did not keep them, I returned them based on appearance."
"I wanted to like these shoes, because of the cute design, but they were a little too narrow and not very comfortable.  What's the point of casual shoes if they aren't comfortable?  I do have some foot problems, previously had surgery, so if you aren't picky about comfort or arch support, maybe you would like them more."
It looks really nice.  There are two things that I did not care for.  1.  It is too cushiony.  I have to walk all day at work and it just doesn't give me that stable feeling like my Dansko.  It ran slightly bigger which also makes it difficult to walk in all day.  I will give them to a friend just as a cute shoe and not of everyday wear.
Arms are too small.  I bought a size larger for a loose fit and the body fits but the arms are too small.  I expected it be light material but is is extra light and the material feels rather cheap.  I like the style and the large variety of colors.  I do wish the material was nicer and the size did fit.
i have bought other 2xl dresses from other places and i am a regular xl this is so no the right sizing
Cute. Can turn your finger green. Just coat with clear nail polish every week and it helps.  Biggest problem is that the stones fall out after about a month.
"I ended up giving this away.  Doesn't fit right for a short woman.  I am 5 ft tall.  Pulling it up higher still doesn't work.
Nice quality.  Wish they had petite lengths."
"The packaging was spectacular....  But I can't say the same for the pearls. They are just not of the quality I expected from the description. Sadly, I have to return them."
Fabric way to thin.
"The description stated that these socks were for 1-3 year olds. This is certainly not the case, as they were much too small for my 2-year-olds. The quality is very thin and not so great. I ended up giving them away because I couldn't use them."
"bought this earlier this year and it is still sitting in closet because it is so huge especially the bodice of it, the belt is cheap. bad material for a tropical climate."
"these were delivered and look totally different from the picture.
i thought i was getting a black and white frame but i got
a black and brown tortoise.  does not look at all like the frames pictured here.
i am a bit disappointed but will keep them"
Ordered these and had some high hopes. however they were way too narrow. Tried them off and immediately put them back in the box and set about the return.
So cheap!
"I always wear 9 1/2 W in Asics.  I ordered my usual size and my toes touched the tip of the shoe while sitting down.  I don't know if Asics are changing their sizing or if it's this particular shoe.  Unfortunately, I had to send them back."
"This is a beautifully made coat, but it's just too small. It's cut very small across the chest-I'm a B cup and I could barely keep it closed."
Not satisfied...purchased as a gift and my friend did not like it. It looked cheap and was not something she would wear.
"This particular shirt happened to fit; two others of the same size did not and I had to return them; for one of them, I had to pay return shipping costs, which should not have been; if you order a size and it fits, and you order more of the same shirt, you expect that it will be the same size...not!  I am also disappointed in the fact that the shirt has already faded (navy blue).  The bad thing is that these shirts are being used for uniform shirts and I had to pay to have them monogrammed, and now they are already fading; I am not a happy camper!"
"Shoes are cute but they came in a box that was all beat up and old. It was clearly not new. I was planning to give these as a baby gift, but couldn't because It looked awful. I was assuming this was a new product in new packaging. Not the case."
"Nice shorts - great material. I like that it has the elastic inside to make the shorts smaller. However, it was still way to large - really, just huge on my son."
ZERO STARS  I bought this ring 10-30-14.  Wore it for 2 months.  It no longer looks like sterling silver.  Now it is more like scratched stainless steel.  I should have known better.  Could have found better at a carnival.  Total waste of money
"I ordered a size 9 it felt more like a size 8 I will return for a larger size. But the shoe is cute, vibrant red."
"Quality is excellent, but waist is too low"
"The grommets were broken upon opening box. I had ordered these for my son's birthday and so they were packed away without my checking them. Never again, he was so disappointed that we couldn't use them for hiking."
"Not happy with this purchase!  Necklace not as pretty as pictured, It looked cheap in person - giving to my young niece to wear which is fine for her age just not for me!  With fashion jewelry you take a chance when ordering online and not in person.  Will not order this brand again."
The quality is very poor and it is not 100% Linen.  There is a lot of Polyester in it.  THE NERVE to falsely advertise to unsuspecting customers!
"The color wasn't the same, there were strings hanging all over it, poorly put together!"
The fit is baggy and long. Very thin see through material even for an undershirt.
These are supposed to be assorted colors - I bought them for my 94-yr old mother. She was very disappointed that they were all white.
"Really, really cheap. The watch band seems to be made of compressed paper. I will quickly donate it to Good Will."
"I bought this in a 7.5M, my regular size, but in the process of returning it.  The front of the shoe is comfortable with a rounded toe but the length is a tad short and the strap digs into the back of my ankle so hard that I took it off after a few minutes and knew I would need to return it.  It is a beautiful shoe though and so am ordering it in an 8M and hoping the problems with the length and the strap will be resolved by ordering a half-size larger.  Plus, when I went online to look at the larger size, the price had decreased by more than $20 so I am happy.  Just hope this one fits!

Update - Received the size 8M and tried it on - the back strap was much more comfortable but the front of the shoe was a little too roomy  but I  thought it would be OK- so, I told my boyfriend to make reservations for dinner so I could wear my new dress and these shoes (which went together so well) - fortunately, I got dressed before my boyfriend was ready so I decided to walk around the house in the new shoes and after a minute, I noticed that my foot was slipping forward as the front of the shoe was  too big and the side of my right foot became so painful that I realized that these shoes had to go back too - I was very unhappy as these shoes were perfect with my dress - luckily, I have another pair of Rose Petals shoes (Aubrey) so I dug those out of the closet and slipped them on.  The 1"" difference in heel height  makes for a much more comfortable shoe and as that shoe in a 7.5M fits me perfectly, I will have to send this style back and stick to a 1.5"" heel from now on.  It's too bad because this is a gorgeous pair of dressy heels."
"This hat is waaaaay too big (long). Even when cuffed (like in the pictures) its ridiculously large. I will have to return it.

The material seems nice and warm though."
Great looking shoe but too narrow and no support!
I like the feel and shape of the pants but surprisingly they wrinkle easily and they are too small for me (in the legs).  I'm normally a size 6 and have slender legs.
I ordered the same size I always do and these shirts are way to small
"Here's the thing, I was going for the length & bought a Med...length looks nothing like the photo...nope.  It fits right on my waist & right at my wrists...thought it'd be a bit longer...if it gets put in dryer, will shrink to doll size. I live in the South but from Brooklyn and too lackadaisical about it to return...so I'll represent until I grow out of it...literally."
Felt very cheaply made. Almost disposable.
I ordered Xl-XXL expected to get in an Xl yet got a XXL wrong size not sure how they pick the size for you? Lol IT FITTED OK YET THREW OUT THE DAY IT STRECTH TO THE POINT IT BEGING TO LOOK TO BIG. Didn't take a picture didn't like the way it fitted after a few hours of wearing it. So I trashed it Must have for the price In the right size
Not made for wide feet also it still fits small they are okay on comfort but seem cheap made not as expected was hoping for better
"These boots are so cute, but they are pretty heavy for little feet!  My  3 year old daughter won't wear these.  The soles don't bend when she walks."
Horrible manufacturing. You can see the glue all over the show and the ribbon was dirty.
"it is Big, even with a belt it looks silly on me."
"These are no more supportive than wearing a t-shirt for support. Very stretchy and made from a polyester type material. If you're using them just to hold up your pants, they might work if you buy a smaller size."
"I had to update my original review. The skirt is definitely cute, but it fell apart around the stitching. Very disappointing."
"My daughter is in the 20th percentile for height, and these tights were still short on her, I wouldnt recommend. I ended up having to buy a pair without the ruffles :/"
These were very cute but way too narrow for my sons chubby little feet.  We couldn't get his toes into the front section at all.
"Purchased this set recently and after taking it out of the box I immediately decided to return it as the luggage appears like it will not hold up under the duress of airline handling.  I thought $170 was a good deal...too good.

It looks and feels cheap.

If you're even traveling once in a while, you need a bag that's durable and that will absorb some wear/tear.  Do yourself a favor and conduct a little investigating and pay a little bit more for a good product."
This review is based solely upon the fact that my strap has broken (the metal clasp that attaches it to the bag) and I have reached out to Texbo through Amazon and have NOT received any feedback or reply at all. What makes a good product great is great service after the sale.
The green amethyst is almost clear. It is not green as shown in the picture.
"Cheap lenses, cheap frame, just all around crappy glasses.  Oh and I for got to mention that when I received mine that BOTH lenses were scratched real bad.  If you want quality glasses get a pair of Spy glasses."
Returned the item. I did not care for the cut or quality of the shirt.
"This ""dress"" is no longer than the bottom of my daughter's bum. The dress is also see through. She is wearing this with leggings and a tank because it is completely inappropriate otherwise. Too bad. Pretty dress. Wont be good unless you are 5 feet tall, MAX."
I want a refund
The top fits weird
Did not work as expected. Disappointed.
to small by 2 sizes
"This dress is well made and nice fabric but fits way too small and a bit awkward. It's not as flowy as it looks, it's a tighter fit with more of a straight cut as opposed to more of an aline cut (as it appears). I am 6' and XL dresses usually fit me very well, I ordered this in XXL and it was tight and uncomfortable."
Pay close attention to sizing descriptions Before you order. Had to return
"Not worth the money. Way to small AND it smelled like gasoline. Had to wash it twice and yu can still faintly smell it. Print is cute, but its a waste of money. No point in shipping it back either bcz it will vist me even more....."
Was for a gift for a Batman Lover so Disappointed not a true size 4x way too small. Not worth the trouble to send back!
"Returned this belt. The teeth cut into the ""leather"" and let loose. Trimmed the leather twice more and teeth kept cutting the leather."
very bulky and scratchy not what I was expecting
If you wear over a size 14 this is not for you. Definitely not for overly-curvy ladies. This had odd puckering at the base of my back because of my butt. If you have an exceptionally large chest it will not cover everything.
Very uncomfortable. Hard as a rich insole. Narrow across the top.
"Good watch, stylish..but arrived with scratches on the face.

Third photo is the women's version of this watch, it's the one on the bottom."
These are not comfortable to wear and I felt they were too small for me.  I think they shrunk after my wife washed/dried them.
"Very poor quality.  I needed it for a vacation to haul some of my scuba gear (2 wetsuits, 2 sets of fins, 2 masks, and towels). Weighing at the airport 44lb.  Definitely did not exceed the weight limits. The bag made the trip  but 2 of the seams on the end have split out.  I purchased it so far in advanced of my trip I cannot return the bag. It's a very cheaply made bag. One time use only."
"Average quality.  Sits too low on my nose - nose pads are too wide, unless your nose is wide."
The ring does not fit together like the picture shows.  It also looks very cheap and does not look as good in real  life as the picture shows.  You also have to pay return fees when shipping back even though I returned it within four days of purchase.
"Bought this for my daughter. The fleece-look bit that is the lining..ONLY lines the top of the inside of the hood and STOPS part way down..at shoulder/neck level....so you have fleece ...then (the inside) gray material.
It is NOT plush at all...and not actual fleece.
This really is NOT a jacket.  The zipper is Slightly off center not completely as in photo.

Basically this is a ordinary gray hoodie with an extremely cheap awkward zipper. You get what you pay for.
Very very disappointed.
Will take a photo and post it soon."
took forever to ship and was a knockoff
"I'm really sad to give such a low rating. When I first got the shirt, I was in love. This style is so cute, yet modest for our little ones. The color is vibrant and the material is soft and stretchy. However, even though I followed the cleaning instructions, the elastic all over the shirt seemed to unravel in small pieces. The shirt is no longer wearable because the small white elastic pieces are sticking out all over the place. Because of this, the shirt had completely lost its shape and ability to fit normally. I bought two different colors: yellow and green, and the green shirt did not have this problem, only the yellow one. 5 stars for the green, 2 for the yellow."
Honestly we went to the mall and tried on rings and my daughter was a size 3 there; this ring was WAY too small it wouldnt even go to her nuckle in a size 3. So im Just saying this is a fail!
"The material on this is very itchy! Not to mention the sizes run super small, so if you order it make sure you order in a size or two up from what you are!"
The one I received had all of the clips broken and bent. The product is very thin and cheap feeling. I was unable to properly test it as I received a defective product. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
look like hospice sandals - yuck! thank you Amazon for return option
Serves the Purpose. Not great but not overly cheesy either.
"I love OTBT but these are just not comfortable.  They fit but the design doesn't feel good.  I waited to late to return them too.  : (  And the color is odd on the brown.  Look closely at the picture - there is what looks like white overspray around the bottom all the way around.  I'm sure it was done to make them look distressed, but it just looks like white overspray. I will likely use brown shoe polish to tone it down some.  Not a good product from OTBT."
I would only buy these if you absolutely want water proof boots because your sacrificing flexibility. I wear and wore red wing irish setters all the time and never had a complaint. This is the first time trying water proof ones and not liking them. They feel hard as if their made out of plastic. I wore them to go out and use snow blower in driveway and they were hard and very very slippery. I guess the cold temps didn't help. When I walked in the cold driveway it sounded like I was wearing hi heels or dress shoes. Not a good work boot feel and certainly not flexible.
"I was really disappointed in the quality of this tank. I've gotten better quality for the same price when The Gap has a sale. And no way is this ""longer-length!"" It's a regular length and nothing special. If I hadn't used my Amazon Prime points and didn't want to waste them, i would have returned it"
Turned black not sterling silver. Don't buy.
These shows are very narrow. My daughter has normal feet and can barely squeeze her foot into these shoes. I regret purchasing them.
"I have been picking out some ugly old lady shoes and these are one of those pairs. They are, however, comfortable."
Jeans were very small said there were a 2 online got them to my house they like look a size ten be more accurate with sizes and stop tricking people
Ordered 2- both broke the first time I used them. Plastic strecher plugs broke and wood chipped off. They went back.
"There were two reviews when I bought this bag...one loved it, one hated it. Decided to take a chance, well...I HATE IT. The metal rings are so heavy the bag flops all over. The interior design is ridiculous. What a waste of money."
I need a belt with these jeans and the stiching is already fraying after 2 months of normal wear.
"The shirt is nice but I followed the measurements and purchased size up from my normal size and the shirt was too big. Hate paying for return. If the size chart was correct, it would fit perfect and I would give it 5 stars."
"Attached to the bag, walked a few steps and broke."
"I would not but these again. They're all right for around the yard and house, but never for work as I'm on my feet for seven hrs. and that would never work with these shoes. No arch support or cushion of any kind."
This necklace is really cute - it is very tiny and delicate - but as with other DogEared products it is very cheaply constructed. I wish I had listened to the other reviewers who mentioned it breaking quickly. Mine broke beyond repair for no apparent reason within the first two weeks. Big bummer. Save your money.
"Product was cheap, in both price and quality. I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't super skinny. I didn't bother returning it, but I haven't worn it, either."
"I'm between 10.5 and 11, so when trying new shoes, I went for 11's. I've been wearing Merrells and Newtons, so I'm used to a bigger toebox -- this one wasn't just normal, it was tiny -- felt like a band was wrapped around the front of my foot. My feet ached for half an hour after just trying them on -- I'll stick with Merrells. Back they go ..."
"Sent it back. Got a refund. I purchased a xxl women's size. It sized  to be girls fit.
Too bad, the wife liked it, but can't use it, it's not a xxl size."
It's hard to find FULL length robes these days...I saw this one and had to have it but it's VERY heavy...I mean...REALLY heavy...it's like lugging around a king size quilt...so I only use it to go outside in the winter to walk the dog out back...love the color and that it is a terry robe but WOW...you'd never get cold wearing it.
Sucky
"Does the job of an undershirt for my girl that has to change after school, but I wouldn't order these again.  Very scratchy material."
"I originally gave this dress 5 stars for the quality and value. However I've had it for 3 years now and needed to replace it and was disappointed that they've changed the style. The zipper is no longer in the back but on the side. Which everyone knows is the worst place for a zipper. It makes the dress fit extremely small while running the risk of busting that cheap invisible zipper. So disappointed with the changes they made to the style.

Original Review 2013: Bought this for Oktoberfest and it is as pretty as the picture. Great quality and sooo affordable. I was looking at Dirndls from Germany since the only ones I seemed to find were costumes. The cheapest authentic one I could find was over $200 from a German site. YIKES! So I decided to see if Amazon had anything. And they did! They have a great variety of really pretty Dirndls. I would definitely  recommend buying from this seller. Fits true to size chart. I am a 2 and ordered the 32 which fit perfectly. I'm 5'3"" so it was a bit long on me, but I think typically they are supposed to be. I prefer my dresses a little shorter so I don't look so short. But I know it will look perfect once I hem it. Can't wait to show it off at Oktoberfest."
"Nice, big and light, but not cotton, which was my main search term."
Didn't fit right at all. Too big and too small at the same time. Made my boobs look like weird smushed cupcakes.
These shoes fit great and are great walking shoes.  However they are going to Goodwill because they are ugly as snot.
This would be perfect if the horn wasn't HUGE... I only use the chain now...
Very transperant
"They are not soft or comfortable, or proper fitting. The only way I could wear these boxer briefs was to turn them inside out and even that didn't make them wearable. The bands around the legs is so thick that they're noticeable while wearing a suit. Impossible to wear with jeans. They went into the Goodwill donation pile after a few weeks."
"These are cute, but there's no padding on the footbed.  Uncomfortable if you're doing any walking or standing.  They are true to my size & width & the quality of the shoe looks good."
I work outside and these do not keep your feet warm.  They are also heavy and bulky to walk around in all day
I was very unimpressed. I sent it back.
Horrible work and size was inaccurate
These were to big so I ended up giving them to my cousin. To my knowledge she likes them
See through and meant for a girl with no bust at all.
too small and very uncomfortable
Used the battery in 1 day
The handles were way too short - not in proportion to the size of the bag.  However the laser work was well done and bag nicely made.
Love the fit of these pants and the rip stop material. I have worn these pants for several years and they just don't last long. The crotch goes out pretty quickly and the last pair I bought the upper leg blew out and ripped about 8 next to the seam. Unfortunately I noticed on my way to work and had to make a quick stop and buy safety pins to get me through my shift. Im sad to say I won't be buying these anymore as I really liked them.
The shipping took a while but when I did get it and put it on it was like a XS! I ordered a XL... I doesn't make any sense. I wonder sometimes is everyone in China and Asia are all little size 0 waking around. How is a xl a xs that's crazy. Anyway rhe back is really cute I can still fight in it so I'll probably wear it with high wasted pants. I don't recommend unless you wear a small. But don't order a small order a xl.
"Decent skirt, not too see thru - came with a hole, so that is the reason for the low review."
"Great squeak. Our toddler loved it, but the sole came off on the second day of use. Returning it!"
"I initially like the bag, however after just two days of use, the buckles on the sides broke off and the inside pocket seems to be sewn wrong to where I don't have much room in main compartment. Sadly disappointing."
can't fit on to anything and looks  different than the photo here.
"Do not waste your money!  I bought this mask for my four year old, knowing his head size was slightly above average.  Description stated fits ages 6-12.  When I tried it on him, took me several minutes to even work it onto his head and pull it down properly.  Has zero stretch to it!  It was obvious within seconds of getting it on it wasn't going to work, and my son tried to pull it off himself, but couldnt.  It took me another several minutes to work it off his head, resulting in tears.  I couldn't even imagine trying to put this on a twelve year old!  Buyer beware!"
This turned the boots color to dark brown
"I like, and still like, the first one I bought, but the second caused a rash and severe itching. After some research, I learnt some bras have formaldehyde on them, and can cause this misery.  I suspect either formaldehyde, or some other chemical, were used on the second bra, causing distress.

Natori, review your production process and remove chemicals like formaldehyde as well as any other other toxins.

Update: lowered the stars to 1.  I'd give zero if I could.  This is an expensive bra, and one of the straps has stretch out! So, so disappointed."
"Very disappointed - these came up right at the top in a search for ""triathlon shorts."" I wanted a pair of bike shorts with no padding for a triathlon - swimming is the first event, and I didn't want to feel like I was wearing a bulky wet diaper while cycling and running. Since these were so highly-rated, I ordered them. Well, these shorts don't have flat seams, which is surprising, because they are pretty standard even in cheap dancewear. If I rode a bike wearing these wet from the pool, I'd end up with blisters from the 1/4"" raised seams in the crotch. I'm sure they'd be fine for less chafing activities."
"This was not good.  I love the style, but the fabric was horrible.  It was a shiny polyester blend.  I have this jacket in black in another brand and was hoping this would be a hit.  I could not believe my eyes when i opened.  If the fabric was not shiny this would have been great.  It came packaged well in clear plastic bag and came in a timely manner but the material.......terrible.....I returned"
Sizing was alot smaller than my other pair of Easy Spirits. I usually wear 7 1/2 wide in all Easy Spirit shoes but these were too tight in both the length and width. Sadly I had to return them.
First I got without strap and other one is different logo on.  Im not sure its is newer one or not..
"Hated these.  Way too short and bulky.  I'm 5'9"""
"No doubt, these are cute sandals. But that is where my satisfaction ends. I have an average width foot, but found the upper part too snug and stiff. I wore them around the house for about 1/2 hour and they left marks on my feet. Also, there is no arch support. I returned them immediately."
"I understand that this is sold as a mini dress but it's not even that. I ordered the largest size possible based on reviews. I'm 5'1, 155lbs, 34DD. It smashes my boobs, the back length is long (past my butt) and the front is far too short. It's too short as a dress and too long as a top. As you can see in the pictures, if I wear it with jeans it is very awkwardly long in the back. By itself, it is way too short in the front and has this weird static cling that I can't get rid of because of the type of material. I contacted the seller for a refund and they offered to send me another item, keep the dress they said. That was almost 2 months ago, no replacement item. This 'dress is just a very awkward length, especially the front to back ratio."
"I bought a size 6.5 for women and I received a size 6.5 for men, I'm an international customer and it is very expensive for me to send it back to US."
This didn't work out for me .  I don't think it's maternity .. but it would probably work better for a small pregnant lady.  Very thin material
"no 100% cotton , amazon advertisement it complete wrong"
Very cheaply made...straps fell right off. Not a bargain buy...
Cute shoe but not for my foot. I was hoping for a comfort bootie but it wasn't. Sent back knew I wouldn't wear much.
Not my favorite wrap.  I ordered a few to go with my wedding dress and it just did not feel formal enough. It looked like a very basic cheap chiffon old lady fabric and there was just no dimension to it. So I returned it.
Was no real support
"I purchased a size based on the size chart and it's way too big.  I'll be donating it.  It's also quite thin.  Good for layering, bad for hiding any bumps."
Not worth your time! If you even recieve it. Good luck getting them to respond to you if it doesn't arrive! ~
"Very long! I bought these and one other pair with trim design on the bottom which I do not recommend.  They are uneven in length so the trim at the bottom is also uneven. Then the pattern at the bottom front of the leg doesn't even match the pattern on the back of the leg, all of it--uneven--horrible! Very poorly put together and I don't feel for the price they are worth it at all--so be warned. Material is ok, but there may be shrinkage since they recommend air dry and hand washing. All one pattern pants were ok."
"thin, stretch out after wearing a few hours, will not buy again"
"Way too big ordered the wrong size do to incorrect product description for materials and the style of jean. This called Mid Rise Skinny Womens Jean Super Soft Super Stretch. Which is 81% cotton, 17% polyester, 2% elastane.  Not the 98% cotton and 2%  elastane that's stated in the description. With that being said you have to size down, maybe even 2 sizes since there super stretch  jeans. Compared to 98% to 100 % cotton jeans you don't. Since they are super stretch they are going to stretch out so size down.  The color and style is perfect. So mad I have to return them do to misinformation. Make sure you ORDER THE RIGHT SIZE when purchasing . Also the description needs to be fixed so shoppers are well informed when buying these."
"The material is cheap and, no matter how many washes it goes through or howucb softer I use, it still feels itchy. It is quite small also, so definitely size up one or two sizes if you're wanting it to look like the picture."
"I love the facial sunscreen but this left little white ""beads"" all over my face. No matter how much I shook the bottle or blended it it there was this little white ""bead residue"" all over my face that would not soak in or blend. Im so disappointed in this product as it was not inexpensive and I was hoping to use it on my upcoming tropical getaway, just purchase their facial sunscreen and use Neutrogena tinted makeup instead. Total waste. so bummed"
I am a small. 2-4. I ordered a medium based on reviews. I should have ordered a large. This fit like a cropped top and very snug. Order AT LEAST two sizes larger if you want a correct fit. The material however is very nice.
Looks like a cardigan; is a shrug. Picture is misleading.
"It's quite large. I would say it fits a  toddler with a shoe size 13. The quality is quite cheap, the picture of Belle fell off after just 1 wear"
"I wish I had the option to not give any stars at all. I'm also glad I didn't pay very much for these because they are total crap. The size is unrealistic. The legs were so skinny and incredibly difficult to get over my foot. I couldn't even pull them up over my butt. Wth! Unless I lose a good 30lbs, and possibly my entire butt, I won't be wearing these pants. Ever."
i wanted to love this item but it is just awkward.  neck is too narrow and length is too long
"This dress is SHEER, there's no 6 year old who would not notice. The dress is cute but you can right through it."
"The color isn't a nice red like the photo.  It's a dark brick, dirty color.  Yuck!"
"Pantyhose are not made like they used to be, these had a run in them on the first wear!"
"I bought this for my husband and it was short for the length, compared to other 36"" belts it was only 34"" long. we returned it."
"the ""bra"" was horrible and barely 2 holes connected with string. I actually ended up throwing it out and only using the panty."
Came in timely fashion.  MUCH smaller than shown
"Out of the package, stitching coming out. Poor quality. Honest review. I want money back"
I just received these earrings and went to put them on today and the clasp just broke on the twisted ones when I was putting them on.  So disappointed I didn't even where the pair once! I will let you know how the others hold up but it literally just slapped off..
"It's a good looking shoe, fit good on my foot but slipped off my heel every step."
The panda necklace was missing stones and the paint was messed up!
This boot is nothing like what it looks like in the picture. It is a hybrid motorcycle rider/ night worker boot. It was very disappointed and returned immediately.
"I ordered these shorts only to return them the next day. They are very unflattering. I am 5' 2"", so they might look better on a taller person."
"I took one look at this dress and returned it. The picture suggests a much prettier dress than it is. It is entirely tooo short. It is more like a tunic top. In addition, the construction must be improved or it will just be disintegrate in the washer everytime. Not a winner here."
"I normally wear a 9 - 9 1/2 shoe, so I ordered a size 10 since others said they run small. My foot wouldn't even fit inside, so I returned them and ordered size 11s ...they were STILL too small. Not only that, one of the shoes didn't have its top eyelets for the lace. I will be returning these as well and then begin looking for a different brand of climbing shoe."
"Import junk.  Didn't New Balance use to make their shoes in the USA?  Now we pay top dollar for junk made overseas by people making slave wages.

Whatever the case, these shoes began to fall apart after two months.  I can't say as I've ever had that happen before.  Usually they last half a year before they fall apart.  Amazon gave me a full refund.

I buy shoes made in the USA now.  I recommend San Antonio Shoemakers.  Their shoes are unbelievably comfy and last for years and years.  It's better to buy one pair of shoes for $200 in 2-5 years than two pairs per year for $50-100.  You make up the extra money potentially in one year already, if not two.  Meanwhile, you get better shoes, and you're not filling up landfills with this import garbage."
The strap keep on coming out once you lock it will come off after awhile it's easy to loose it
"I read many reviews and ordered those leggins, but don't make my mistake! Quality is low, still they are pretty warm: I wear them with my snow pants and go for a walk with my little son and feel ok (-10 - -15 C) if U r going to wear it like this U can buy it, but if U want to wear them like pants don't"
This case is gigantic and the covering is cheap looking
"Great fabric, but runs small"
Smaller than expected and poor quality stitching on seams.
"I loved this bag for the first week and a half. Its nice and roomy, plenty of pockets and space for your needs. But then the strap broke. On the end of the straps there are metal clips that connect to the bag. The clip broke and makes using the strap impossible. The handles on the purse itself are becoming worn and doesn't look as nice. I've put the purse back in its dust bag and am donating it."
Shorter than pictured. Hems appear poorly constructed. I don't expect this to last very long.
Not horrible but looks better in picture than in person.
chain broke. 1 month after i bought it. too late to return. beautiful otherwise
"Bought 3X shirt for my husband, who wears a 2X and he could hardly put it on.
Bought M for my son, who wears a M and it was too small, even before we washed it."
I had to send it back.  Very bulky.
very fragile - had multiple runs within the first couple of hours of wear. Did not fit even though i followed the size chart. Will not order again.
"horrendous quality - they claim these are leather, but it's plastic...and what's worse is that they fall apart very quickly - i was foolish enough to order them in both black and brown and BOTH pairs had the heel crack apart from the sole of the shoe as well as the uppermost eyes busting apart when trying to lace them up...never again"
"This rating is for fit only because the look is awesome...beautiful colors and embroidery. However, that's all useless if you cannot wear it, and this is definitely not a ""one size fits all"" item. This tank would be well suited to larger, curvaceous body styles. Smaller women beware, this totally looks like a maternity shirt and is in no way flattering on smaller frames. In fact, I am small to medium framed and this was ridiculously big on me."
It Was not what I expected
"I know why its so cheap, its a bad design. Im a size 6, and I couldn't get my foot in it (normal size foot here). The zipper is fake, and it has a very narrow opening. Maybe if you're incredibly skinny, or a very small child with large feet, but I doubt it.

Sad, cause its a beautiful boot."
"I wore them for maybe 2 hours and my feet were throbbing. I stopped using them, and wear them with sock to get them loose from thw toes."
"The fit wasn't what I was hoping for - it's not as long on me as it appears on the model (on me it hits right at hip level) and the sleeves are too short. Also, the fabric is very thin and hasn't held up very well after a couple of washings. I'll probably get one or two more wears out of this around the house or doing yard work (it's too junky and unflattering to wear in public) and then unfortunately will have to toss it."
"omg! WAY WAY WAY too small!! and a foot too long!!! I'm 5'9"" & they bunched at the bottom. don't waste your money!!"
"So comfortable! Way too short for men though. Bought these for my husband, but he had to give them to me!"
"Did not fit right , seemed too big poked me a lot, returned"
"I have no idea why they would manufacture these and sell them only using the bra size as a measurement for them. Sure, it fit my bust just fine, but I could barely get it over my hips! They don't take your waist or hips into any consideration when selling these.
Otherwise, it was fine I guess. I have to send it back and they don't have any other sizes so I can't say if I liked wearing it or not."
"Hare to get on, the straps break. It wasn't worth returning as they were cheap. I would not buy again or recommend"
These sandals fit tight and within less than 30 minutes had to take them off. They were attractive and looked to be well made but I had to return them for comfort reasons.
The 1st pair I wore got a rip/hole in the crotch area the 1st time I wore them.
Colour fade with one wash
Runs extremely small and the tie is not in the pants. It's separate.
"This product is horrible! I am 5'8"", a size zero (xxs) in brands like BCBG and Bebe and an xs in most brands where that is the smallest size. The dress arrived with a small hole in on the side near the arm pit and the zipper was so flimsy I didn't even attempt to zip it all the way . I have usually had great luck ordering dresses from Amazon and this brand had good reviews. If you are use to high quality bandage dresses do not by from this company. They do not take returns unless they sent you the wrong dress. I don't like this method and Amazon should stop selling there products. They say if you got the wrong size it is your own fault. I am so extremely dissipointed. I feel cheated by a deceiving Asian based company that stole $50.00 from me for a poorly made product."
will be returned as it is too small for our 18 month baby.
Was much too small.
Tok tight i ordered and x large. And still too night
"I was very disappointed with this product, hair was falling out and it didn't look all that impressive.  I guess if your using this at night only for a Halloween costume then maybe it's worth it."
"Adorable, but the posts broke off after two wearings."
"Ick! Stiff, uncomfortable, very narrow toe box, came up too high on my ankle and rubbed by ankle bone. Felt like I was wearing wooden shoes"
"It says for winter but when it arrive is for warm weather, has 4 models, hot,warm,almost cold, winter cold, they send me the warm weather one so is slim and helps sometimes but not always"
"I am typically a size 4 dress. I am 5ft 5, 120lbs, the dress was way too tight and the neck line is plunging. Looks like a classy dress on line but is super slutty in person."
Do not buy! As soon as I out this watch on it fell apart
I sent it back to small for junior high schooler
"Sorry, had to send it back.  I have some of the same in black from last year.  More support, but the black fleece leaves my toes all black even after a year of wearing.  This pair just too squishy.  Could not wear as a shoe, just not comfy enough for an expensive slipper."
These shoes look beautiful online and when they arrived.  I bought two pair one black and one tan.  Unfortunately when I wore them my feet hurt so bad I could not wear them the full day and in fact I only wore the black pair once for less than half a day then took them off.  I'd like to return them because of the fact I spent money on two pair of shoes that I can't wear and they weren't cheap.  No stars is appropriate...
"The shirts are cute, wide for the size we ordered (medium, 4) and look quite cheap but for a kids screen shirt that's pretty typical. My biggest complaint and issue is that we did not get the colors or heroes shown in the picture. After returning them twice, we never did get the right ones. We will not be ordering again."
This seemed to have good control.  It just didn't fit the way I wanted it to.  Not very comfortable.  Just wasn't what I wanted.
Got a 6 in mens. Usually wear an 8 in womens. The shoe was too small. Need a 7.5.
Very pretty but very poor quality!!!!
The quality is not very good. Thin bandage material
Received late & very wrinkled. Top is very pretty & style & colors are as described but stitching is horrible. The workmanship is poor which limits use of the top for beachwear cover up only.
Tight on my thin calves and thinner than I expected for the price
cute shoe but they run very small for an American.
Poor quality.  Shrinks when you wash it.
"Look, I really liked this product when I first purchased it because it fit well and I love the samurai design. However, after just a couple months the fabric is already beginning to fray and come apart. Such a shame. :/"
"When you bend your arm it hurts you elbow, you would think it has a space molded for your elbow or is padded inside, but no the inside is a flat plastic not shaped for a bent arm, so imagine that you grab a plastic sheet of about 3 or 4 mm thick place your elbow in the center and tie both ends to your arm then try bending your arm, that's exactly how it feels, and since is not shaped inside it doesn't stay in place either, I thought it could be because they were too big for me, but then I imagined how my elbow would hurt if they were tighter. Bottom line I am returning them."
First they were too small.  Second they were cheaply made and not worth the price.  I sent them back.
"This is not silk nor satin.  It is a polyester blend. But if that's what you're looking for, this would be perfect. I bought this because it was advertised as satin."
"Cheapest of the cheapest quality, and I've had cheap. I returned it."
Quality is very bad nothing like the picture. The flower looks awful. I will never put it on my baby's head. Very disappointed. I give no stars.
Very short or too small
Very cheap quality and way too small.
Product too large. Has what is like a pin poking into my daughters foot. No response from company
"This yoga pants will be going back.  Even though I bought a size M based on review advice (normally I take XL or 1X) , they would need to be hemmed several inches...."
Got lost in the USPS delivery center...go figure if someone should use this shiiping option for luxury items...
I expected a heavier weave since it is labeled a blanket... it's a scarf... no wow factor
I own a pair of these already but ordered a second pair and they are narrow.  Sad to say this brand may not be consistent.  Decent arch support if you can get a pair that fits.
Had a hole in it. Very thin material. Disappointing to have a defective item before first use.
"Super cute but the plastic around the piece that goes between your toes is awful. I couldn't believe how much it hurt.
Another reviewer said to cut it off but I was afraid I might ruin the shoe so back it went."
Was looking for this style---would have much preferred if they had quality arch support.
Poor quality. Sent back. Very see through and thin.
"I own a pair of the dark blue flypaper jeans already, purchased from Ross. When I received my (supposed) exact same jeans from this seller, they were not the same. They looked and felt like knockoffs. Flypaper jeans are light, soft, and slightly stretchy. The dark blue pair I received were stiff and everything about them looked a little off. I laid them next to my other pair, sure enough, they look like cheap knockoffs.

Oddly enough, I also ordered a pair of grey jeans from this seller, and they came as the typical light, soft, and stretchy jeans I'm familiar with."
"I wanted to love this jacket. I needed a cute ""work"" jacket for gardening and I generally love everything Carhartt. Unfortunately, this jacket has one of the weirdest cuts I have ever seen. I am 5'9"", and I usually wear a size 6 or 8. I ordered this jacket in a medium and it was almost too tight in the chest area, but flared out into a what almost looked like a peplum, at the bottom. I am not busty, so the fact that it was small through the chest was surprising, but the way it flares out towards the bottom, makes me wonder who on earth this jacket would fit?
 Too bad, because the fabric, color and lining are all features of this jacket that I really like. I am reluctant to try a different Carhartt style, unless I can try it on before purchasing it. This jacket is going back."
The color is too orange for me.  The material is rather strange and although it is synthetic it doesn't look at all like leather.
I liked the look of the wallet and all until I found the little hidden warning on the inside of the pouch. It said this product contains chemicals that are known to cause cancer. Not something I was interested in.
Item came in an envelope. Earrings were smashed. Necklace turned my skin green and Rose Gold rubbed off after a few wears. Great product for one time use if you order it with a box to keep it safe during shipping.
"These sandals didn't fit as well as. For some reason, the foot bed was too shallow and unlike other ones I purchased. It's strange. It also came in an unmarked box. I got the silver ones and brown ones, and only the silver ones were shallow. I'm being purposely vague in some aspects because my original post was not approved, which is odd."
The cut is skimpy and when you wash them they shrink. The crotch is not wide enough to support the narrowest of panty shield which most women of child bearing age rely on about 25 percent of the time. I am an enthusiastic Amazon shopper but I will buy underwear in stores from now on.
"Save your money. This is junk. Half leather, half vinyl. Mine is falling apart after 1 month!"
"Why-why-why are shoe size's not standard in ballet shoes? I just enrolled my 5yr old daughter in ballet class and ordered her standard size 9 shoe size in the capezio shoes. Unfortunately, I did not read all the reviews, nor do I see the size chart (at least not shown on my iPad). Anyhow, shoes are too small and now I'm stuck with them.  So annoyed!"
"This wig was terribly itchy and hot and would not stay put, not matter how many bobby pins I used. In addition, it had a lot of bald spots and really did not look good once you got up close to it. However for 2 nights around Halloween, I suppose it worked well enough. The next time I need a wig I'll spend a bit more money for the comfort."
I receive one pair larger than the other after ordering both of the same size the info on both box say 3.5 but after opening l found out one is 4.5 other than that they are fine
"I purchased two pair of 505 jeans because the two pair I owned were finally wearing out after about five years.  Their longevity is a testament to Levis.  I bought these jeans without trying them on...why would I?  They are the same jeans I have been wearing for decades.  When I finally tried them on at home I thought I had returned to the 70's.  They are very low rise jeans - the only thing missing was the 10 inch wide bell bottoms.  The genius who decided to ruin a classic rather than simply introduce a new lower cut style, has probably destroyed relationships with thousands of life-long customers.  I will return these jeans but never return to Levis until someone undoes a huge mistake."
AWFUL quality
Too goddy so i returned them.  :(
Do not waste your $ on this. They're so thin and your nipple shows right through and they don't hold anything at all.
Foot slipped around to much in this shoe.  I have sent it back for a refund.
It looks pretty but looks are deceiving. It. is made from very flimsy material and does nothing. Its a waste of money.
cheap product.  not shiny and looks very very poor quality for pewter.
"Size is not the same tha USA made or Mexico Jeans made
Will be very good , that Amazon include where has made.
is not the same Lesotho that USA or Mexico. I think that in Lesotho equal that China They never  saw a American tall men."
"I ordered this headcover with the matching pin.  The cap came, but after waiting a few weeks I was notified the pin was delivered.  It wasn't.  I haven't seen it.  Amazon refunded the money for the pin, but now I have a hat without the decoration.  The hat is too plain for me, and I don't like the color I chose.  The pink look more vibrant in the picture;  Altogether I am not happy with my order."
I'm not plus size and these were waaay too small in the calves. They also seemed cheaply made. Noticed they were not made in the US. Expected better from this brand.
broken the first rain
These shoes have an oddly shaped foot bed and they are very wide.  I had to return them.
"You should be able to choose the colors/patterns you're getting.  These were odd.  I ordered according to my hip size and they fit around the hips, but they barely covered my rear (which is not particularly large) and the elastic rides up my cheeks.  I'll go back to my trusty Jockeys.  They cost a little more, but they're worth it."
arrived loose and broken.....the piece that locks to the stud behind ear is broken....don't know what I'm going to do since it's a Christmas present........terrible......
"It showed up with a huge kink in the chain and it's not fixable. I'm returning this product immediately, I was very disappointed. Only buy this if you are fine expecting it to be broken. Had higher expectations than this. Good looking, but not wearable"
These moccasins were nice for a very short period of time.  The return window closed on Jan 31 and on feb 7 they started falling apart. The stitching  is coming out and they will need to be thrown away.  Very disappointed in Dockers and will have to look elsewhere for a good replacement that will last.
I have worn them only a few times and they already getting holes in them. Pretty disappointing.
"I loved the design of this wallet, with the clear slot to display ID on the outside and its compact size. However, it falls short in person. For one thing, the makers call the color cherry, but it's closer to burgundy. More importantly, the zippers are stiff and awkward, and you need both hands and much maneuvering to get them closed. This isn't a good thing in a wallet that's supposed to be carrying loose change. It's a good idea, but if I'd seen this wallet in person I'd never have bought it."
In only 3 weeks they are beginning to come apart at the seams. With no scuffs or scraps the thread just falls apart at the seams. Happens right at the inside of your foot where your toes bend when you step.
It's not even hemmed. Just go buy some cotton knit fabric and you've got this item. Returned.
Zipper broke after a little over a month. No one strives for quality anymore.
Runs very small. The size chart is not accurate.
"Never tried them on they were not what what was pictured, sent them back  never to order again"
"bummed, it is too small"
Too narrow for my narrow feet.  Passed them onto a friend's child with skinnier feet than mine.
"I love the outfit in the image however the top was stitched together wrong, the sleeves were different length and the neck didn't fit my child.  The pants were so tight around the ankle I can't imagine any infant fitting in them.  The sweater is cute and I can mix it with other outfits we have.  I was very disappointed in this item."
These run way too small. First pair I got I could barely fit up one leg. I wear a med and they fit like an xsmall. I had to order an xlarge just to fit okay. They are comfortable if you can get the right size.
One rod broke within a year of use with only vey mild weather.
Horrible quality. Stones fell off after a day
Nasty fabric.
The size was totally off and I have a history of communications with this seller about issuing my refund for the returned dresses and they have not gave me my refund yet. I am totally dissatisfied with this purchase and seller.
Lovely idea but not warm enough for NJ winters
Too wide in the front part so they look strange
Not too bad looking but really narrow
One of the bars broke really fast.
"Lost the luster after wearing it for a few months, not even on a daily bases."
This chain broke in less than 48 hours of wearing it.  Can I get it refunded or replaced?
I sent it back because it was too large.
The reason for 1 star is only because the opening to the boot was extremely to wide.  I returned them so I have no idea about the wear and tear.
"Seemed durable. The smell that everyone complains about is no different than any other new smell but all the pockets, including the inside largest one are way too small to fill even close to a traditional diaper bag.  Was looking for more room, not less."
"If you are a petite person with a small head, this hat is not for you.  Even though it says you can adjust it, it wasn't enough for me with a 20inch circumference. Lesson learned, best to buy hats at an actual store. Kmart had good ones and I ended up buying two there."
"It is useful for its purpose, but its too big and really ugly."
I bought this dress as a surprise for my spouse but had to give it to my 10 yr old because of how TINY it was!!! It's really sad because i was truly looking forward to wearing this for date night. :(
"YOu may as well throw your money in the garbage or give it to charity as these are worthless when at least 2 sizes too small, shouldn't be allowed to sell these as stated."
I bought 3 shirts so I tried one on for fit. Put the one shirt in the laundry and it shrank by at least 1 1/2 inches. Purchased tall sizes as I am a tall man. Not worth my time I'll stick with carhart and Baurer for my clothes.
Way too big! I want to return them...ordered a medium for my teenage boys. The width fits but the fingers are enormously long
I have never received the ring. I got the earrings and the necklace both separately but never received the ring!!!
"You get what you pay for, the fabric is awful and fraying and the tags in the back itch I can't wear these for more than a minute in a seamless garment spend the extra 10 cents and use a heat seal label it should be common sense to do that in a garment."
I have to return them. Although size 10 as requested my toes barely fit on the front.
Way too small and tight fit size.
"I got this to downsize my wallet. I also ordered the Crabby wallet here. I have to say at the same price the Crabby wallet is much better made and has more features.

As for this wallet it is already having issues with the stitching falling out and the logo is already threading away. I really wanted to like it but especially at $15 it's not worth it. I am not sure how it has so many positive reviews."
"While the product material is good, the sizing is off.  The Chinese just don't ""get"" American women I've decided.  I'm 5'8"" and 140 lbs and usually order a Size 7 in underwear.  That is I used to be a Size 7, when the manufacturing was done in America.  These panties in Size 7 are in reality more like a 5 or 6.  Buyer beware.  Of course you can't return underwear, so I'm stuck with these."
"We returned this immediately. It didn't work. Kept saying ""ERR"" when we turned it on. We returned it through amazon, and bought a different brand."
The gold one is pink. It's not as vibrant as it shows on the website.
What a waste of money. It doesn't look a thing like you'd expect. It has pockets and the sewing is sloppy. Don't waste your time or MONEY!
"Thin material, & it had no shape to it, so a very unflattering fit. Had to return it for rfor a refund."
These are cheap and the lenses pop out and can be purchased cheaper at party supply stores.
MATERIAL IS THIN & CHEAP LOOKING.
so small so stiff not cool
it was cheap it turned colors i was expecting better quality not what i expected very disappointed will never order again
Would not fit a doll. Save your money....horrible.
fits weird - the one we recieved was very poor quality - a seam tore the minute it was put on my husband's head.  very disappointed.  they sent another one and didn't want the defective product back.  new one is a tiny bit better quality
The fabric is too thin and no matter how pretty the different versions are in the front - you always end up with an ugly mess in the back.
Came with batteries but never got it to turn on. The only reason I am not returning it is because it is more of a hassle to do so than just throw it away.
"This is a knock off product (Levi's Mens 559 Relaxed Straight Leg Jean, House Cat, 31X30 )!!! The stitches, the patch, the buttons and markings, they are not really the same with the original Levi's clothing!!!

Don't buy this one!!! I'm still working out with Amazon to give my money back!!! The seller is Amazon and yet they are doing this!!! I'm really disappointed!!!"
"It was intact when it arrived, but that's about all I can say about it. It's cheap and chintzy, you're basically getting what you pay for. I guess I shouldn't have expected much. I'd recommend you save your money and look elsewhere."
I am and 8 and got an 8 but  my foot might as well have been in the atlantic ocean the things are HUGE!
I returned these shoes. They were big and arch felt wrong.  I have worn Merrell shoes for years and most are very comfortable.
It ordered this shirt in 2x but caught 2XLR and It is huge. I won't buy here anymore
Do not purchase this unless you have small breast and are the size of a 12 year old girl.
It was surprising to me how a pair of such low heal shoes can be so uncomfortable.  Most of my shoes are heels/platforms so I wanted a lower shoe.  The strap that you slide your foot into is hard and rubs on the foot.  I returned them.
"This is a child's size and lengthcloak, maybe for a 8-10 year old. The fabric is thin and unlined, and unravelled at the ends during the first wash."
"These pants fit about 2 sizes smaller than the size chart explains.  If you are an athlete they will not fit you correctly.  If your thighs and your waste are the same size they will fit well.  The material however is very cheap, they fray, and the zipper broke after and during the very first wear."
Picture makes the ring look better then what I recieved
Beautiful show but leaves a sore on the top of my foot
I returned it.  way to small in the waist only.  fit my bust and arms
these didn't fit my glasses.  i got the wrong size!  smh
"These glasses are built for pin-heads. They will crush your brain. A throughly badly molded set of shades. I sent mine back as ""Un-wearablle"
The material is not of good quality.
"Made cheap...looks cheap.
Put it in trash where it belongs."
Send it back. The strands were coming undone & the top fit awkwardly
"Did not like the costume at all.
Terrible fabric. Not what I expected"
"I am 5 months pregnant and have some low back pain and SI joint issues.  I need a hard soled shoe to walk around the house in and thought with the great reviews this product would be perfect.  Unfortunately, these just never felt comfortable.  Also, I really dislike the style - too old lady-ish.  Given their great return policy, I still wanted to give them a try since other reviews said they helped with their pain issues.  I gave them a fair shot and ultimately decided against them.  I've returned them and will look for something else."
"These are not the jeans I was expecting. I ordered the straight-leg version but I do not think the pair was labeled correctly since they are not like previous versions of Lee Riders I have received in the past. As you can see from the photo, the pant leg is a lot narrower than the Lee Riders straight leg pants that lies beneath the ones I bought. It is too much hassle to return them, so I will wear them but next time I will go to the store so I can be sure they are labeled correctly."
Actually they were too small in the hip area and far too large I the bosom. Difficult to put on. Returned!!
"If you're looking for a nice bra, this might be the one...but order one cup size smaller.  They run big.

I purchased two of these bras based, sight unseen, on the reviews.  Big mistake.  I was deployed overseas and really did not have much of a choice.

When I recieved the bras, I was pleased with the quality of the construction and the feel of the fabric.  They are soft and pretty.  Then I put one on.  ICK.  Not so pretty.

I am definitely a full B, even a C cup in certain bras.  This bra had all kinds of extra fabric sticking out around the nipple area.  They stick out like a long boob-cone.  The cups also separate the breasts too far and give entirely too much ""individual breast definition,"" if you will.  I looked like I was wearing a 12 year old's training bra when I put on a tee shirt.  Ridiculous.

Of course I could not exactly send these back from overseas, so I simply tossed them into the donation bin.  I'm glad that others were able to enjoy these, I certainly did not."
Cheap feel. Very flimsy. Not the same quality as other shoes this brand.
"Yes, I would say that it is one of the most confusing digital watches I have come across.  Confusing in how to program it and the function of the buttons.  However! That isn't the main problem.  Every time I want to see what time it is, I have to push the 'Light' button to light up the numbers on the face.  How weird is that?  Thought about taking steps to return it.  But it is was rather inexpensive so I feel the hassle and cost of shipping it back is far more than it is worth."
My son have been wearing mitten (hand made) for more than 2 years but he refuses to wear those because they don't allow him to feel things and also they are too tied when you try to put those on! i bought the size up. Will still keep them in case we go ski and he changes in mind but..not useful for now
"My son is 5 and wears a size 2 - the socks sizing were not correct because these sock were too small. I gave them to a relative who is 3 and they just barely fit him as well. Be careful on the sizing, go up in size!"
"These do not live up to Teva's typical quality standard.  They are chunky, cheap and EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE.  The thong divider rips into the flesh between your first two toes so much so that it makes them unbearable to wear for longer than a few minutes at a time.  Also, they look super cheap and chunky.  The only redeeming quality I can find is the color of the straps.  It's a very nice neutral color, but the cheap spongy look of the soles, cancels this out.  I wish I could take the straps off and put them on the sole of some Chaco's:(

I do not recommend these if you, in any way, care about the comfort of your feet!"
I ordered the wide width and they're still too narrow.  The shoes seem like they're sturdy and made well though.
"It did not come with watchband pins, so when I went to change out my watchband, I couldn't use it. I have the pebble time round, which has very specific pins that can't be transferred to another band. So now I'm returning it. Don't get if you have a pebble time round."
Small for a men's 13
I ordered according to the sizes given. It was WAY too small and cheaply madethe buckles ripped off! In the bin it went.
"I adore Lucky Brand & typically wear a small, but this see-through shirt definitely runs small. I found the fabric a little scratchy & the fit unflattering. This one will be going back."
Received wrong dress totally.  Returned for refund
"I ordered size 7 which is the size I normally wear, but when I tried them on they are too short.  I measured them against my other size 7 shoes and they are about 1/2 inch shorter.  In order to send them back and get a larger size, I would have to pay the postage both ways, so I will keep them, but will not be ordering shoes from Amazon again!"
"When I received it it was tangled and since I purchased it awhile ago I'm still trying to untangle it,"
Nich belt. Extremely thick and none bending belt.  However what the belt joins the belt buckle will tear off very easily.  You can not repair the belt if it breaks.  I know I found out the hard way.  I only wore the belt four times before it broke.
"These are cute socks. Disappointingly they're definitely knee-high not thigh-high. I am 5' 6"" and they barely come to my kneecap."
Too small and the star won't balance
I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTER WHEN ADVERTISED!
The picture showed a low profile turf cleat.  The actual shoe had full cleats meant for outdoor soccer.
I am a size medium size 10 pants and this item seems to big. it rests right over my hips rather then flowing around the hip bone like its shape. While the compression garment is on the board pushes and rubs up against my hipbones making it very uncomfortable I think I would've chosen a different style so I don't get rub.  It does seem to be made out of some kind of dense cardboard covered with a nylon material there are cuts in the cardboard that allow it to be flexible to wrap around you.
Runs way too big. Returned
"Too smallpox tight and when it's washed it may just go on a doll. No stretch, crappy material."
Poor quality. It was ruined within 1 day
"Doesn't fit as expected, kept rolling down, really tight,"
"These shorts are awful.  I bought them for my son, who actually is a 31 waist.  They were very inexpensive, and I should have known better.  Should have sent them back.  Have yet to find someone who actually can wear them....I would NEVER recommend these..."
cute but way too big for a small boy.
The gap between the picture and the picture is too big to be worn once.
I expected better quality for the price.
"These do not fit very well at all. The toe comes to a point, last time I checked I am not an elf. They do not stay up very well or fit very well even with a guarder belt. If you are a small girl, do not buy these, these are made for larger women."
"This shirt is huge. When you order I would order true to your American size. It also has those little fringes on the side that are like the lazy man's fringing, which looks terrible. The shirt is also very thin. I thought it would be more like a sweater dress but it is no way near."
Its too big but its very comfortable I ordered the right size but its still big and it when I ordered this product it's zipper broke first time trying on jackrt
"If you have normal to wide feet avoid these socks.

We bought these socks for one reason and one reason only.  The picture showed that there were no extra elastic feature in the middle of the feet.

These socks are not the ones shown in the picture.  The picture doesn't show, but they have extra elastic feature in the middle of the feet that will hug your feet tight.  So, if you have normal to wide feet these elastic feature will suffocate your feet and your toes will lose blood circulation.  In result, your toes will be cold and they will sweat.

If you have narrow feet, they might work for you.

I want sellers to show pictures of actual items.  To me, that's a false advertisement.  Don't lie to us."
"The Wasatch GTX is generally a pretty good boot.  They are comfortable and maintain good support on the trail.
Generally they have held up pretty well in the two plus years that I have owned mine, but they have developed cracks where the rubber toe cap meets the upper near the sole* that will soon render them useless once the GTX liner is exposed.  This happened WAY too quickly for a (nearly) two hundred dollar boot.  It's sad, because other than this detail, the boots were pretty good.  *I should note that this is NOT something that regularly happens with boots
that I wear due to sizing or foot anomalies."
Broke after a few uses.
"Not as comfy as I would have expected.  It was nice to be able to open up the wrap for skin to skin, but the ties irritated my skin when trying it on, so it is going back,  Seems expensive."
Nice shirt but it's too small on my boyfriend he ended up giving it away to my son but it's nice I bought it for him to and wear it I think is not exact to size
I ordered this dress and a whole different dress came!
"This IS NOT a Coin Purse in ANY WAY. Its a fob ONLY. Pretty, but the crossbody purse it matches has 2 small very cute fobs on it already."
Horrible quality. Snapped off where the pin attaches to the face from normal use.
"I like the fit of these jeans in the hip, but the ragged holes are an issue.  These jeans will not last.  The ragged holes are too big and have already begun to separate, showing skin."
This crappy ass shirt was very misleading.  I thought this was for girls and am still not sure who its for.  It certainly does not fit my daughter 10-12.  Do they make that size in a womens????  From another country too expensive to send it back
"If you have wide feet, do not buy these shoes they run very narrow, hated to send them back as they looked great and seemed like a good quality shoe"
"I've purchased these through the years, but the quality sure has gone down.  Not only are they smaller than they used to be, but the material is noticeably thinner.  The old ones, which are probably five years old are thicker than the new ones. Yikes.  I wish they'd bring the quality back up because I really used to love these booties."
I didn't like the shirt...sorry
First day I wore it. The leather strap broke. Super cute. But wasted my money 
LOGO STARTED CRACKING AND FLAKING AFTER FIRST WASH.
this product fit like a garbage bag
small for size 4. cheap quality
"They are not cut full enough in the seat so they don't fit me well, they ride up.  If I buy again I will need to go up a size, not good for the ego."
They don't tell you this is coming from China - don't waste your money or your TIME!
I ordered my regular size. 32FF. It is a very flimsy bra. Not good support. Material very thin and would easily rip if worn more than a few times. Straps very thin for the size cups as well. Returning this one.
"One of those unfortunate waste of money 'meh' moments. Yes it clipped paper currency well enough, but physically it proved to be inconsequential in size when the wad of cash started thinning down, hampering its ultimate usefulness. I've since gone to other means of clipping my cash and this clip has found its way to my 'IDK if its misplaced' pile."
"could not fix it after it came apart.  I was expecting better quality than this, and was quite disappointed, and embarrassed since it was a gift."
"Pretty shoes, well-cushioned, good arch support, and quite comfortable. After wearing them about 5-6 times though for a full day, the rubber tread of the sole separated from the shoe in the heal area and flops when I walk. Will attempt to re-glue, but very disappointed."
haines fit better
"I currently own two other pair of Nunn Bush lace-up shoes and have pretty much exclusively purchased Nunn Bush dress shoes for the past several years. I know I have owned at least four different styles and I always order size 11 1/2 M...always. They always fit VERY well and are comfortable, that is why I ONLY purchase this brand.  So I purchased these shoes. Silly me, they didn't have an 11 1/2 M, so, seeing as how I learned back in elementary school, so many decades ago, 11.5 is the equivalent of 11 1/2, I ordered the 11.5 M shoe...NOT EVEN CLOSE! These shoes are tight around the ball and arch of my foot and the length is off a bit as well. The shoes look very nice and I am very upset that I can hardly wear them. How can the same company produce shoes labeled with the same size that are radically different?"
The black paint chipped off within a week... And it doesn't glow in the dark. Cheap...
Not right to size
"Fits SUPER small. I usually wear a medium or a large but wanted this to be extra large and sloppy, so I ordered an XL. It fits like a medium and it is not off the shoulder at all. It's more of a boat-neck fit. I decided not to return it, I can still wear it just not how I had hoped."
"First I'd like to say I already own a pair of 90 degree leggings for workouts and running! Very pleased with they initial product, so much so I wore them in my first 5k so I was excited to purchase my secondo pair for my next 5k. However, what I just received is a far cry from what my first purchase experience had been.  The material is almost completely see through... I mean just running my hand along the inside I can see my fingernails through the cloth.  To be clear I ordered the same size large as the first time,  difference being color and style i.e., long vs. capri. I think it's because of the color pattern as well,  seemingly rich and vibrant hues are lost when the pants are barely stretched.  I'm hoping this is a malfunction and I will be selecting another color to replace these because my first pair have been such great quality.  I'll keep you posted on how that works out!"
Have not had good luck with Bali in the past but decided to take a chance. Should have listened to the reviews. The material on the outside of the cups doesn't match the material on the inside and it wrinkles. There is no way to fix this. Will not order Bali again.
"The shoes do not fit like any other Eccos I have had and I've been buying Eccos for more than 15 years. I have probably owned 25 pairs at least of Eccos over the years and these are the only ones I cannot wear.  Really disappointed.  The shoes slip at the back and even after ordering a non-slip insert, the shoes still slip."
cheap. this is not real fruit of loom product
Seams fall apart poorly stiched
"The hat is ok for the price but Amazon should seriously include dimensions for items such as hats. This description doesn't include the circumference of the hat nor the rise of the hat and the brim size, which make it difficult to estimate when you're making a purhase.  People that review these items don't really help because they say things like ""got lots of compliments"" or ""looks beautiful"" or ""bought as a gift and loved it."" How do these comments help a buyer to make an informed decision? Luckily for Prime members it's free shipping both ways, but what if you didn't have the time and needed it right away? In my situation I just wasted this order because the fit is ok around the head but somewhat large but the brim is too wide and now it's too late to get something else. I wouldn't have ordered this if it stated this in the description or if someone took the time to write it in their review. This is going back unfortunately."
Ugh was expecting a lot more from all the good reviews. The cheap material and design of this shoe keeps giving me blisters and cannot wear them around more than 30 minutes.
Product came indented on right side cups. Also it won't stay sticky.
"Product stitching fell apart on shoulder one wear in. The material is nice but product was defective, too lazy to return. Bummer."
"has a really weird smell, bought as a gift for my grandmother, she says she got the smell out and that she loves it, but I don't see her wear it ever."
A corner stone fell out one week after purchasing. I was very careful not to shower or clean while wearing. I would not recommend for an every day ring.
"I love the style and the height of the heel. However, the shoes have a strong gasoline smell.  Too bad that I will have to return."
"I'm so disappointed in these pants...I read the sizing chart, took my measurements and bought a size small.  They fit great everywhere except they were ridiculously tight in the thigh... I work with children and I need to be able to go from a standing position to sitting cross legged on the floor quickly, but these were so tight in the thigh that I could barely sit normally, let alone with my legs folded up!  I reordered them in a medium, thinking that I could always take in a slightly too baggy waist myself, but they were HUGE!  Like, absurdly, dragging on the floor, pooling around my ankles huge..  I have a fairly average body type: I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs.. only really 'big' spot on me is my rear end, but the smalls fit fine for me in that area.  They had to go back"
these hurt  my feet athouth they are wide feels like they are still to narrow. Dont really like the cushion it has and they hurt in the back of the ankle . not woth the price .
The rubber piece of the heel fell off after wearing only twice. I've contacted the seller to see if they will send  a new piece to replace it.
"I was really excited to try these. When I got them I was surprised by how thin they are. I've had other mittens that are thin because of Thinsulate material so I thought this may be a similar material. Not so.

The fit is good. I generally have to buy large or extra large gloves. These are extra large and they fit nice. Not too snug and not too loose. As Goldilocks would say ""they are just right.""

The part that goes over the fingers doesn't overlap enough so your fingers easily slip out or the flap falls to the back of the hand. I like the strap that holds the flap in place when you don't want your finger tips covered. I've had other mittens like these and never had a problem like this.

The thumb flap is a good idea in theory, but Isotoner needs to do more research before they put them on other mittens because the thumb tip doesn't remain covered. Mine constantly comes uncovered even when I'm not really doing anything.

Overall I am very disappointed in these. Even if I purchased from a store I wouldn't have known these things until I bought then and wore them, and it's easier to return them in those cases."
Very ruff material. Itchy and doesn't fit like a woman's sweeter almost like a mans sweater. I would suggest not getting this sweater.
"nice shoe, I have 2 pair in different colors.  This pair was not only too wide, but too long.  Same size as the others that I have purchased from another source.  I returned this pair."
"Not worth 18$, cheap hot mess that breaks before you even get it on, I pulled this up over my boney waist and the pearl on left side popped out of the stitch. I am 5' 105lb.

Don't waist your money"
"These pants are probably made for yoga, but they are too tight around the waist and thighs and then flare out at the bottom.  They aren't cut for curves and aren't comfortable.  Also, they're made of very thin material. The other issue is that I ordered a product advertised as new, but I received these pants with no tag attached, they were wrinkled, threads were hanging off. They were crammed into a three-inch square package as if sent from somebody's basement.  Very disappointing. I've had this issue before, and even though I love Amazon, it's something other customers need to be aware of.  Not sure if this review will actually be posted - as I'm typing, an automated tip from Amazon is telling me:  ""reviews about the product are more helpful than those about the seller and shipping."" I understand caveat emptor, but do wish someone had told me items sold on Amazon are not always new."
"These earrings look ok; not too fancy, considering their price. The lock on one of them didn't click, the lock was probably broken"
These are pantyhose thin!  They should be described as footless pantyhose. The pattern is cute but you would have to wear these under a dress so no one sees your panties.
"The pink looks more like purplish pink, okay for the price but not the same exact colors like picture"
would be cute if the xtra large would have fit even my 10 year old
These socks got holes in them right away.  Even on the top of her foot.
"After a five hr shift on my feet I felt like I could barely walk.  It was just my second time waring the shoe but compared to other Rockports I had bought these really ended up hurting my feet.  I didn't feel any extra comfort.  I am a bit different since I stand all the time at work as to people that can sit down, probably many of the other reviewers.  I exchanged it for a walker rockport and am much more pleased with them.  I've owned several and think Rockports are still a great shoe.  I just didn't see any extra support and didn't want to keep it to long to decide."
This dress has no shape at all.  Huge.  A shaped from the shoulders out.
Bagged at the ankles from the first moment.  It was a very dressy NYE event.  They did feel nice to the touch with a classy subtle shimmer. Baggy ankles did detract from the image I was trying to portray. With some clever tucking in the toe of the shoe and a switch to an closed toe maryjane pump allowed for my show to go on.
"These do not stay up! Beward. There is no actual waistband in these. The band is made out of the same product as the panty (no elastic or anything) and they stretch and fall down when you walk, taking your outer garment with them. They come in a pack of 15, I have 15 pairs of panties I can't wear. Serious design flaw for plus size panties. They seemed to be fine out of the package new. I tried them on over my other panties, so I thought they were ok, but as you wear them, they stretch and begin to fall down. I had gotten them, tried them on, liked them, washed them and then wearing them, realized the issue. Beware. I was grocery shopping and could not keep my jeans up, because these were down below my hips pulling my jeans down, it was embarrassing."
I got the package and wrong item came.
Two of the five shirts had brown stains on them.
"The look and fit was fine, but the seam on the side came apart within a week. Very poorly made!"
"Feels cheap and poorly made. my wife really does not like it at all, i waited too long to give it to her so i was unable to return it or i would have done so already."
"These have heel slip and I can't wear them. They do have the the build quality and comfort I need. Its a near perfect fit in the toe area, which is really difficult for me. However, they just slip on my heel and there is no fix. I sent them back."
Had to give to my grand daughter.
"I searched for ""silk nightgown.""  This one is polyester."
It looks good but not at all durable. The chain broke even before I wear it!
Super cute but they all broke within a week
bought L and still looks like a small US size. cheaply made. Don't waste your money
I've never had a problem with Reeboks until now.  Really bummed
Very thick waffle texture.  No drape and not pleasant to wear for exercise.  Not very attractive either.  The description could have been clearer on this point.
"I ordered a black shirt and recieved a brown one. The shirt is pretty, but it would be better if the straps were adjustable considering that they're very long. It's a low cut shirt."
"I am fairly small, 5'4"", 110 lbs, so I was very surprised to find that I could barely get this bra on. The band was so tight!  I could've used at least two more inches in order for it to be comfortable. The fabric was very soft and felt comfortable but the tight band made it impossible to wear. Shame."
One star... yeah...bad product. Never purchase.
Not at all what I expected. Thin and can't even wear them
"worn maybe 3 times,.....into the closet they went.  downright hurt."
"Pants way too big, upset I missed return date by 2days"
"I got those boots today. Those boots were OK quality, the leather was ok too, not that good quality. The biggest problem those boots to make me return is the shaft is huge, especially the calf part. I have normal calves,about 12.5inches but when I put my legs in those boots, the calf parts were so lose, lots of space left. Then if you look from outside of the boots, it made my calves look huge and fat with lots of space inside. But they are kind of tight at the ankle/vamp part without long enough zipper, so they are not very easy to put on. Then I usually wear size7.5 M, but those boots fit big and wide. My feet didn't feel any support in the boots, too long and loose. I just can't keep a pair of boots make my calves much fatter looking. The arch support of those boots are poor."
"Sizing is way off I wear twelve and this, which is marked size 12, is at least an inch too large."
Not what I expected. Don't like the way the material covers the watch. Just not tor me.
Unfortunately not very satisfied with this product. The top is true to color and fits very good at first but it looses fit after washing and is kind of poor quality (which should be expected in this price range)
"I thought I would save a few bucks by buying Croc Flip Flops from Amazon; mistake.  This style runs small, tight and the toe box is short. My feet are not fat nor are my toes even remotely long; these are rendered unusable."
I love this style but my wide feet just won't allow these to work for me.  Best for normal or narrow feet.
I need them to put women with real breast in these cloths it will give me a better view of things...my small ass boobs and that bra do not match at all..but it suppose to be a small
"Gold Toe Fluffies were soft acrylic a few years ago but now are stiff, unpleasant, cheap cotton.  #SAD"
"They look cheap,they looked more like leather in the picture,they're ok,they are comfortable but they just look cheap"
"I was astonished when I saw the lightweight construction of this. It great on my feet but I was terrified of walking around outside with it or snagging the side of the shoe on a rock or wall. I would bet that this shoe would not last more tham 5 trail running sessions before your toes are stickig out.

This may be a great shoe for dedicated racers looking for an edge but not for casual budget minded runners"
They look cheaper in person as they do In picture.  Priced accurate I suppose.  But they are very thick between the toe.  Only recommended for long flip flop wearers.  I'm not and I can only handle wearing them for a very short period of time.
"Made in China Crap.  If you are looking for a cheap pair of shoes, these are it.  But save your hard earned money. First of all, I ordered a size 6 1/2 but received a size 7. Huge pair of shoes. No point in sending the shoes back to China. The costs to send back far exceeds what I paid for the shoes to begin with.
Second, the jewel toe brooch is beautiful and the reason why i purchased these shoes. However, 2 of the blue stones fell off. Not happy, but l guess l can glue gun them back on, again save your money. They arrived on time but the quality is poorly made. Service, well if you tell them what you need, pay for it and they send you something else..... How can you give them more than a star! Save your money."
"The shoes are cute. However, they were a full size too small. I normally ware between a 10 and 10.5 depending on the brand of shoe. to be safe I ordered the largest size offered, an 11. The shoes fit like a very small size 10. I could barely squeeze my foot into the shoe, let alone walk in them. I did not send back as I didn't want to pay for shipping."
"Saw this same bathing suit at Victoria's Secret for quadruple the price so thought I'd take the risk of ordering on here instead. Usually I wear a xl top and s bottom, this set comes together in one size so I just went with L knowing I have plenty of other black bottoms I could wear with the top. When the item arrived I immediately tried on... The top was soooo TINY and as expected the bottoms completely fell off. The material and hardware are cheap and appear that way upon first glance... Wish I had just saved up for the VS one!"
"The 0-6 month size is way too small.  My daughter was only 3 months old when I bought these, and I could barely stretch them over her head, and once they were on, the brim would have to be folded down to get more coverage and enough surface area to keep the hat on.  Her head circumference is 40.5cm according to her pediatrician.  I think her head is a little bigger than average, but seriously, 6 months?  No way. So.. these are really cute but were a waste of money since they were all too small for my daughter."
"Lots of room, but the steering on this is not great. Material feels somewhat cheap."
"I loved the color of these scrub bottoms. However although through waist fit fine, the legs of the pants were too long and we're very baggy (I'm a small)"
Ok to wear as pajamas
Total waste of money. They shrunk on the first wash despite me following the instructions and now my son wears them. Dont buy them. The fabric felt cheap right from the start.
"I'm 5'9"". This thing is so long I nearly killed myself wearing it on the stairs.  It's dangerous.  I threw mine away."
"Its beautiful to look at, but I am a 42B so I ordered a 2X.  Sorry this 2X must be for someone in China or another 3rd world country where the women are exceptionally small.  Oh I could fasten it, but after 30 minutes of wearing it, I believe I would pass out from lack of blood circulation.  These look comfortable, but unless you are a 36B or smaller, you can't wear them."
"I wish I would have read the reviews first. The shirt is way to small to wear. Waste of money!!!!!!!
Not only is it too small but the buttons don't even go down near the bottom of the shirt!
They say order 1 size larger...you need to order at least 2 sizes larger that's how far off these shirts are. Better yet, order a shirt from a company with some quality control and gets the sizes at least close!"
Some say these run small... mine were HUGE. I ordered a large and what arrived would easily hold two of me. They look like a 3X or something. The lable in the pants says large but these would fit a Sumu Wrestler. Disappointing.
"This shirt did not meet the standards I had expected, it wrinkled easily and was undersized for an XL size. Makes me want to avoid Kenneth Cole shirts. One time is enough."
"Runs way too small, like 2 to 3 sizes too small. I ordered an extra large and it would fit my daughter...who wears a small"
"Shirt ripped after one wash, hole in seam on sleeve. Beware of quality."
Runs very small. My husband could barely get in on his arm. I realize it is a compression sleeve but I own other products and the fit was much better.
"It is a giant parachute of a shirt, incredibly unflattering and not ideal if you're large chested."
You need to buy a size bigger and wider than you are.
Double check with seller if this is the product u see on the pic. The cut is completely different. Design is slightly too
"The solid blue socks pilled visibly on the first wash (in a well-maintained high efficiency washer, normal cycle, cold water). I don't think I'll be able to wear these in public after two or three more washes. This low quality is unacceptable to me. I highly recommend looking elsewhere."
size not as described n it was damaged
"After few months from receiving my watch Gw-4000D (different a little than watch here) and in rapid change in temperature (exit from inside the house to cold air 35f out side) fog rapidly appear inside the watch face. After that I start notice it even just from less mild changes (if the watch face air conditioning duct in a car in summer).

I was hoping this fog problem solve and with time but after 18 months went to seek Casio help, and this was there response""

Thank you for contacting Casio America.

We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing problems with your watch. How long has the fog been in your watch? It is normal for some condensation when there is a rapid change in temperature but it should go away within 30 minutes.  If you would like to send it in please follow the instructions below for repair.""

G-shock cost me around 450$ and it's ""normal for some condensation"" in environment that watch with tenth or less of this price hold still without any fog or condensation."
bought xl and it was like a medium; could barely get one on. other than that fab colors and fabric.
"Read reviews and ordered it 2 sizes up, so this may actually be true to your size, had to return it because it looked like a moomoo lol it's super thin and longer than I thought it'd be. Not cute on me what so ever, maybe better on you?"
"I usually rate things pretty high. I was expecting them to last a long time. I got them in September, probably wore them 10-15 times and kept them indoors all winter. One of the straps pulled out the first time I put them on this season. Years ago, similar Columbia sandals lasted me several seasons, maybe 5 years or so."
"It hurts on the side, I wore it for 20 minutes and it blister the side of my feet."
These costs are wind breakers at best. Should not be sold as rain gear
Returned because they are way to loose fitting
"Too bad.  I've been wearing Romika shoes for years, and I can walk for miles in them.  Their shoes used to be made in Europe, and the quality was excellent.  This pair was made in China, and I have to say the quality was not up to par.  They didn't fit like they usually do, and they were not comfortable.  Sent them back.  Disappointed because Romika used to be a go-to brand I could rely on."
"Cute shoe but definitely not for wide width (C/D) ladies. Very tight in the toes and sides. Such a shame because I love the style of these shoes, but they are the most uncomfortable pair of New Balances I have owned and I only wear New Balances."
This wallet was very cheaply made. I hated it from the moment I unpacked it. It feels like there is cardboard in the middle of the leather sections of the wallet. I only took a chanc eon this cheap wallet because it said it was made out of lambskin leather. well they forgot to mention the cardboard parts of the wallet...I returned it and purchased a Ralph Lauren Polo brand wallet instead.
I love the design on them but they run kind of small cause I got to keep pulling them up from the back
"Cheaply made, funky kinks in the one, but the one was really nice."
Very Very Cheap Made
I'm 5feet 10 inches in the socks only came to my camp so I gave them away to another o.r.tech
not a cute shirt.  The cut is very long and narrow over your hips. Falls much lower than the model.
Doesn't look as pictured. Wouldn't buy again
It lasted about a half hour outside with my 7 yr old daughter before one of the spokes had bent at a joint and broke. No bueno.
Really weird fit. Body fit perfect but my arms and shoulders were way too tight. I feel like if I flexed I would shred the shirt.
Cheap quality. Glue all over the place. Returned cause strap was broken and parts were falling off.
Decent set but some pieces arrived broken. I had no idea how to use some of them as week or what their function was. I had to return.
"I  only received one shirt, not ten and it was not Gildan brand. The one shirt was small and of poor quality."
"My mother bought this dress for my daughter (Order number 106-5650241-6425817) From far away the dress looks great on my daughter.  However, we were sent an incomplete dress. The dress in the back is shorter than the rest of the dress.  I can overlook that part.  However, the lace appliques were cut out TERRIBLY and there is NO beading what so ever on the dress.  We sent the seller close up pictures of this to show the poor cutting and the lack of beads and she asked for more pictures.  We sent her more pictures of the whole dress with my daughter wearing it and the seller believes it ""looks nice"".  Now I have to spend the time and money to fix it (trying to cut the excess tulle around the lace to make better edges as well as trying to glue and hand stitch beads).  The only reason why I am not giving this a 1 star is because it arrived much sooner than anticipated and the fit is decent. As you can see from the pictures, there is no beading on the dress and there are poor scissor cutouts all over."
"Ad said ""Twin Slim Genuine Leather Card ""  and twin means two just alike. I only received one but I paid for 2."
Waste of money pins are weak not sturdy.
"It fit fine. But I hated the way the bottom was sideways. I thought it looked ridiculous, returned it."
"It was too big in the shoulders and back, I had to send it back."
I returned it because it was too large.
"The first pair I ordered was too large and I have returned them for a smaller size.  I most often wear a 6.5 and that is the first size I ordered, put them on and they were comfortable, but for a water shoe that will be worn without the removable insert, they were far too loose and too long in the toe.  I had almost an inch at the end of my big toe to the end of the shoe, so I sent them back and ordered a size 6 replacement.

That being said, I like the colors and the quality seems very good.  It is a light shoe with a thick sole and are quite comfortable with the insole in them.  I purchased them to go to a beach where I regularly camp which is replete with sharp shells, broken glass and jagged rocks.  I was looking for a shoe providing adequate protection from contracting tetanus that also dries quickly. I think these will do nicely as the uppers are composed mostly of mesh (but with the sturdy toe cap) and the soles have drainage.  I do like the shoelace stopper/keeper.  The one feature I'm not thrilled about is that the tongue is permanently attached to one side of the shoe and another small, stretchy band pulls it towards the other side of the shoe to keep it in place.  The tongue does not seem wide enough and the stretchy band seems weak.  Time will tell on how that plays out.

As a bonus, with the insoles, they actually have arch support!  I have high arches and this is a constant peeve of mine with shoes, even shoes made for running - they rarely have enough arch support.  So, I may be using these for my workouts too, especially since I live in Texas and the summers are hot, humid, and hellish.

**Update: I just received the size 6 and they fit really well!  Just snug enough and still a little room to spare in the toe, but not too much.

***Update:  I finally had a chance to wear these to the beach.  While they seemed very comfortable while dry, they ended up rubbing huge holes into both my heels. It was like the top part of the heel just dug into my upper ankle.  I tried taking the insole out, tried tightening the laces, tried loosening them - nothing worked.  I wore them once and never again they were so incredibly painful.  It was a real disappointment because as a water shoe, they worked really well.  Just amazingly uncomfortable on the ankles."
Pretty Dress but way too small! I think  would have to go from Medium to XL! If it were not for the tag I would swear China sweatshop. I have not been able to wear it because its too small so it has not been cleaned.... I would be interested to know what happens after 1st wash.
Really thought these were too cute!  I purchased the burgundy ones but the color was very pale and were also too small even though it says it is true to size and their suggestion was to even get the size I normally wear.  Will be returning them.
"The cup material is extremely sheer. I would recommend this for very light use, perhaps only special occasions, as I imagine it would not last long as an everyday bra."
I ordered  two and only got one. The material  is nice but the layout  leaves much to be desired. I would  not  repurchase.
The shirt was tailored well and fits correctly but the fabric is really cheap and almost paper like. Very coarse and the opposite of soft.
"Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas. He says they bled all over his clothes, so he threw them out. Bummer. Great price."
"This dress is way too short. It's more of a tunic than a dress. I'm 5'6"" and the dress comes to just above mid thigh. I'm kind of upset because it would have made a really nice dress. I'm just gonna wear it with leggings."
Poor quality shirt em injury in the second set
"The worst most uncomfortable bra ever. Bought it in my regular size, runs ""very small"" , re-ordered again in a size up( never have to do that) and again, felt suffocated. Hurts too.. I'm a huge fan of the Warners no side effect line.. I have all their others bras and they are so comfortable and true to size.. But this one.. No good! That is probably why it is so cheap-"
"Do NOT waste your Money, this isn't worth a Dollar, could get better at the dollar store...."
Neckline was much lower and shorts were much shorter than anticipated. The waistline seemed slightly dropped as well and there was significant gaping below the neckline (where the fabric appears to wrap but doesn't...I still am not sure why this area was not just sewn shut). The second star is because the fabric was very comfortable and light (almost a little too light though...as if I was wearing lingerie).
"I don't know why this has positive reviews. It is really poorly made. I bought this as a gift for my fianc and when I opened the package, the plastic panel was peeling off and the corners did not meet. It looks very cheap and I am returning it ASAP!"
this shoe is the right size but the style does not make sense as the shoe slips off ones feet due to lack of support from the built up back.  the only thing i will wear built up is a neckline..
Garbage. Photocopied logo
"I don't like because it is plenty clear, transparent.. I can't use.."
"First one was missing a whisker and had a broken face. Second one had sharp edges on whiskers (I cut myself). These are not well made, and surely not suitable for kids."
"Barely covers your toes,not made well,feels very plastic-like"
"These are the WORST pants I've ever bought.  I ordered a normal pair of pants, and I get somehting that is a cross between a pair of slack, and a pair of sweatpants!!!

Never again will I order Dockers from Big-Tall....I need real clothes, and I get clown pants!"
This thing was ugly you can get a cape from anywhere don't bother
"Didn't like these.  I have a 33 inch waist, and the Mediums I bought were so huge in the waist I had to pull the drawstring super tight just to get them to stay up.  So tight, all I could feel was this tight little string all the way around my waist.  It was the only thing holding the pants up and it was uncomfortable.  Plus, the pants didn't breathe and got uncomfortably hot in the 4 minutes I was wearing them.  The ad says material is 77% poly and 23 rayon or whatever, but that is NOT the case.  The tag on mine shows a poly/cotton blend like 65 poly 35 cotton."
"WAY too narrow. Also somewhat small length-wise. I'm a solid 10 medium or 10 wide in all types of shoes, so I ordered this in a 10 B, it would have taken a 10.5 D or 11 D for this brand to fit me right. ORDER UP.
Shoes seem to be of great quality however. Returned and they didn't have my size when I went to order again."
"Zipper broke after a few uses. Disappointed with this purchase. Upon receiving I was very pleased with the appearance of the bag,I guess the construction was poor"
"Very uncomfortable, stiff."
"so disappointed they were the wrong size, not bad quality (I think.. Haven't used them) but I don't understand why they were the wrong size since I got different plugs, same dealer in the right size."
This skirt was nice.  But the sizing is ridiculous.  It was made for a child.  Not an American woman.
Not very good quality. Hood is fake and isn't deep enough to actually ware on your head.
These for my daughter perfect in the waist but once I washed them they shrank so much in length that she can literally wear them as capris. I didn't even know it was possible for clothes to shrink that much in just one wash
"I absolutely hate these. I tried to get a replacement for my Croc flip flops but was unable to find the size and color, so I settled for these. However, there is no comparison. These sandals are just not comfortable. The stitching in the insoles is oddly placed and scratchy. The gel is not really supportive and the straps are a bit narrow. Gave them 2 stars because as much as I hate them, they really look good and stylish. Unfortunately, for me, it is all style and no substance."
These socks are not plus size they are very tight in the foot.  My grandson has a wide foot and we were looking for for something wide enough to fit his foot.  This one does not.  I am hoping  they will stretch  out after several wearing and washings.
Trunks fit fine... the liner was small and uncomfortable...
They are weird. My feet kept slipping out of them and the heel was put on crooked. No thanks.
"Wanted to love these shoes after owning a previous model for years.  My old ones endured 3 years of hard use.  After wearing these about 3 times, the tred separated in 3 locations.  And I wasn't doing anything aggressive, just weight training and some basketball.  Completely unsatisfactory.  Went with some INOV8 235s and love them.  Don't know if NB quality is trashed or if this model is unique."
Just didn't look right.
Fell apart!
"I have 6 and one on order Sketchers sneakers in different colors divided between go walk 4 and go step. I decided to try these because of the reviews and the snappy color. BIG MISTAKE. I should have returned them immediately but I thought from the reviews and sketchers reputation I would give them a try. By day's end my feet and back were killing me. I order a full size up to accommodate my arch support inserts and these sneakers run small so although they fit it is a snug fit. I wish I could return them, but I wore them out and can't. I do not recommend these in any way or any form."
was at least 1 or 2 sizes small.  Disappointed.
"Way, way too narrow.  I ordered a wide and they say they are wide, but they are not US wide.  They are probably wide for other countries, but not the US.  I have worn Clark's for years and these are the first problem I have had with the width.  Held up to my other shoes they are definitely narrower, by quite a bit.  Don't you wish people would actually make what they say they do?"
The fit was a little wide. The color was as pictured. I could tell the shoe wasn't made well. A staple was sticking into the inside of the shoe from the sole. I wouldn't recommend these.
Runs VERY small....XL couldn't even get past my husbands arm.  Very nice shirt but if you are larger than a large - not worth it.
"Very beautiful, but I ordered a size 6  received 6.5. I wear 5.5 but have to order 6.  6.5  is way too large"
"Very cute hat. But it's plastic, feels like it anyways."
"These run extremely tight, my daughters weighs 96 pounds and struggled to get these over her thighs"
U have false advertised this umbrella a real blade runner umbrella has a white shaft not blue please make sure u credit my acct i WANT THE WHITE SHAFT OR i WILL RETURN IT
This costume is really poorly made and cheap. I ordered it and she wears around the house and it is falling apart. Not good for the money spent.
Heels kept slipping. Gave them to my daughter.
Way too tight- tried on for 30 seconds with tags on and had to take it off. So disappointed that I can't return it ...
Cute style. Pearls became tangled on the stand and eventually broke upon a first time use. Disappointed..:-(
Arrived totally broken. Returned.
Horrible. My wife couldn't even pretend to get this on.
"I ordered and washed these without trying them on (foolish I know) because I wear the lee comfort fit slacks to work all the time and didn't think anything of it.  I apparently wear misses not plus, these are completely different.  The waist is slightly larger than expected, the legs are baggy but the length is all wrong... I am 5'2""  (and I have a longer torso / shorter legs than others my height)and they barely graze my ankle. The cut is all wrong, and they just feel terrible.  Too late for me to return them but buyer beware, even if you usually buy the brand, try them on!!!"
"New Balance has been my Go to shoe... but no more. Every time you like a style, they change it for cheaper material and thinner liners. (See pic) Their called Response 1.0 performance inserts... but I have toilet paper with more layers!! Yes consumers.... that thin black line in the photo IS their liner. SMH. Typical behavior to reduce the quality and thereby reducing the wear time...then increase the cost. The shameful liner to my husbands new pair speakes for itself. If NB is going to reduce their liners... they should also reduce the cost to off set the seperate liners you are forced to buy. They are expensive and add to the cost of the shoes! Very sad us loyal consumers have to move on to another brand to be satisfied."
"Just didn't fit right for me. Liked the pattern but not the way the top, off the shoulder, fit.  Returned."
"Crap top, bad quality. Fell apart after two washes - Fabric stopped hugging after two washes and lost all elasticity by 3rd wash. Its a rag in my house now."
"Very pretty, but much smaller than expected.  I ordered the size I wear, but it seemed to be at least 2 cups size smaller.  You also have to pay if you return it."
Do not buy these. Do not keep drink cold & they stick together.
"After only a couple of wears, the velcro part of the Z strap has separated.  The shoes are too loose to wear.  Would not recommend these."
"The ones I got did not look anything like the picture.  This is not a 3"" band jock.  The pic has been blown up to make you think it is."
"I wear a 10 in all other Salomon shoes, but tried a 10, 9.5, and 9 in these and they were all too long, but really narrow. I finally gave up."
Wide in the heel area. Stiff. Feels sweaty when worn without socks.  Returning
"I like large hoop earrings and these were very pretty and different looking.  However, the pair I received was defective and I didn't want to replace them.  I simply returned them.  I thought they were too costly be have a defect with the closure. ."
"love the color, but returning because of the fit. Fits is good except in the sholders, to tight"
"The product was great to put on the bag, but within 2 trips, the backside plastic which held my address card, fell off and within another 2 trips, the entire label fell off...... Good idea but not long lasting."
The fit and quality of this shirt is horrible.  I wish I could give it ZERO stars. I use it as a rag to clean my car.
I'm usually an 8 1/2 but this fit more like an 8.
Seems to be made well but way too wide. 2nd pair that I've returned and will look elsewhere. If you wear wide shoes my advise is to by regular width!
Too difficult to figure out the correct size to buy.
I think it looks really cute on my girl friend but it is REALLY Small. . .She won't wear it!
"I don't even know how this got so many good reviews. The material reminds me of a shower curtain and is nearly transparent. The fit is not bad and neither is the style but I have bought cheaper things on amazon which were much better quality. If I didn't live in Jamaica, I would have returned it  to get my refund"
"You'll need to size down. Some parts fit well, but others were too baggy."
Meh quality.  It was an impulse buy and I didn't end up giving it because it felt so corny when I was holding it in my hand.
To large for support in jogging
"This shirt fit as expected, however after the first wash (before I was able to wear it) the edging around the collar dulled out and looked worn even though I never wear it yet.  So now, I can only use it as a scrapper shirt, not the dresser casual shirt I intended it to be."
I wear US medium for most wardrobes. I ordered a medium of this jacket and I can't fit in it. It looks liked they shipped me a youth size. Terrible! Is this your medium size. I can't even button it and my arms will noy go through the sleeves. I don't know what to do with it.
"It seems that the size and toe space is different depending on where the Crocs were produced. The ones from Mexico seem to run smaller with a narrower toe space than the ones from China. This makes it difficult to order because it is not clear as to where the product being sent to me is from, Why should there be a difference in size for the ""same"" shoe? Are the templates used different in different countries. It may need to be stated in the order guide where the product being sent is from, or it would be best if the buyer of the product can choose the manufacturer of the Croc. All of this is moot if there is still a difference in fit between the same products from the same country much less from Mexico vs China. That's why it is so confusing when I read the critiques of the product where some one would say the size is 1/2 to 1 size larger than stated and someone else says it is 1 to 1/2 size too small. The comparison must also state whether they were discussing a Croc produced in China vs Mexico or where ever."
"These look very appealing, but I cannot wear them. I have a rather high arch and the top cut into my foot. This is the 3rd Clarks shoe I have tried with no success. I think I just can't wear Clarks. I wish I could, as I know many love them. The styles and quality are great, the fit just doesn't work for me. I also found the built in arch supports to be uncomfortable."
Beautiful ring until the stone fall out after a week. 
"This is a junk- and I waited 13 days to receive this only to find out that it is junk. It leaves a blotchy, matte finish but most importantly- its not color fast! Any moisture that touches the surface removes the polish. I thought this was at least semi-permanant!
Buff it? Buffing completely removes the polish... JUNK."
I bought 5 pair of black pants. 4 of them had a huge hole in the crotch and 1 of them had a huge hole in the back. I need them for work so instead of sending them back I just took them to a dry cleaners to get fixed. I'm pretty disappointed and will never buy from this seller again.
"I've ruined 2 pairs of sheets. It has been washed per the instructions several dozen times and still the ink rubs off on EVERYTHING. From my sheets to the hair on my bum which then discolors the toilet seat. It is a nightmare. Also, these are sheer. I don't mind that, but it was a surprise to find out.

All in all, they went to goodwill. Truly disappointed. I purchased black. Not sure if that is the only color with issues."
they look good but the seams are poorly done. The croch seam blew out in a week. These are beyond repair.
I paid way to much for these. I was so dissapointed. The a lagging made it worst. The boots were folded in half so the fringe is sticking straight up 
"This was a gift for my granddaughter.  It would have been perfect, but it was missing the top for the doll pajamas.  Im hoping the top can be sent."
"Be aware, these are fake."
"The arch support on these shoes was phenomenal. It's like the shoes and the soles were designed by two different people. I don't have a wide foot, and I did not order a wide shoe. The box and shoes said they were not wide, But there was SO much room left over in the heel area, my foot was not secure and was just wobbling around in there. Plus; unfortunately when I wore them, they looked like grandma shoes... in a bad way. And I once owned the same pair of shoes as my grandma. If they could get that sort of wonderful sole with the arch support into an attractive shoe; I'd get them in a second."
I usually wear a size 4 & this scarf/sweater was too short to drape like the picture. I will try stretching it to see if I can get more length.
"I thought the blue fringe was part of the hip scarf.  Don't waste your money, it's a rip off & made cheap. I returned the item two months ago and have yet to see the credit."
These sunglasses are really cute but you can see the American flag design so much that it's distracting. You can NOT drive with these on at all.
Awkward fit. Way too much wide leg cut.
So frustrating! One shoe fits slightly tight the other slightly large. I thought I had two different sizes but both read the same size. I'm going to send these back and reorder. Hopefully the next pair will be correct.
"This purse is quite the bright gold.  If you are looking for a purse to stand out, this would be a good option for you.  I returned it as I was looking for a more muted tone."
"Way too small, not good quality, scratchy"
"very big won,t stay on foot"
size smaller than expected for usual size and fit
"Nice looking boot, but too small, and very uncomfortable."
Weirdly long in back.
"I have purchased 8 jackets from amazon lately and this is the worst by far.  the fabric is thinner than a t-shirt, you can see thru it.
 is skimpy - the xxl is more like a medium or large.
cant imagine anyone would buy this if they could see what they are getting,  even in a size that fits.  arrived balled up in pkg about size of a grapefruit - nothing to it."
Waaayyyyy too small for helix piercing.
The outfit was very cute and the material was fine. This romper just runs extremely small. Order 2-3 sizes up.
It came without the top button
These shoes slip right off my feet. They appear to be made for women with Wide Width sizes versus regular sizes.  I'm giving them to my mom.
"size 11 was more like size 14, I had to return the boots for credit.  They are still trying to get off the east coast and head west."
Ordered xl and received medium!!! Very disappointed! These were for a trip!!!
"Adorable, but there was a hole in the seam."
These were way too small. I ended up ordering the men's same size because of the tapered fit and shorter sleeves.
"I measured myself before ordering but the fit was horrible. The material super thin and the cup fitted really weird
Returned the item"
"I love the look of these sandals, but they were too large across the top of my foot.  Don't recommend."
"I read the reviews before buying these and someone had said something about finding holes in the socks, I thought it must have been a a defective pair but I had found two socks with small holes , mine have been only worn twice !"
The sleeves were usually long and oddly shaped so I sent it back.
"Mhhh. Looks cheap but it tells the time. Won't be bummed if/when I have to replace it.

Update - quit working after less than a year (purchased on June 13, 2017 and quite April 30, 2018. Just like I knew it would. Not more Amazon cheapy watches for me."
"I bought these as I have 3 other pair of Teva flip flops which I absolutely love. This was my first purchase of leather ones however. I love the color, but the are too tight. Compared to my other pairs, same size, they are obviously smaller in width and length. I did not read the prior reviews on these as I honestly did not think they would be any different. I will be returning unfortunately."
Shrunk after one wash in cold water and low heat dryer.
I usually wear size 8 but this one is too small for me. :-(
love the shirt.. big problem was it runs 3 sizes too small =(
It does not cover your butt. Decent quality but its only good for the very skinny.
Cute bracelet but 2 of the snaps won't work at all and the 3rd snap barely holds. It pops open within minutes of wearing the bracelet.
Cheap material. Dont waste your money
"This dress was way too big and very unflattering if you have even a little tummy - I look pregnant. Not for those with short torsos either. I was really disappointed. Perhaps it works better for taller, thinner girls."
"Wayyyy to big! My son is between a 5 and a 6 and in first grade- he is tall and thin....these things are HUGE. I put them on the smallest waist size which was okay but the length is Way out of whack. He can't wear these for another few years, and he's extremely tall for his age."
They are pretty tight and the quality is not what you would expect from pediped - they was torn apart and started look very badly after a few months of wear :-(
"I ordered a size Large and although I am very tall, I have a short torso. This Kimono Cardigan fits like a Bolero Jacket and its beyond unflattering. I loved the pattern and material, but unfortunately, it fit like it was made for a child. I wouldn't bother ordering this if you aren't a considerably SMALL person"
Great quality. Shrank in the wash  real bad. I would suggest buying a larger size then you normally wear
The earings were a gift to my mother. She wore them for a couple days.  Time them off and the hinge on one of the earings broke.  It's completely unwearable and can not be fixed.  Very disappointed.  Would like to return them.
Clarks has gone downhill big time. I had to throw these shoes away 6 months after I got them because the leather on the soles wrinkled and started peeling off.
Way too small. Plus size women have bellies. This shirt was not made for that.
pant legs are SUPER wide! Thought they were supposed to be straight leg but they must think when you order a petite extra large that your legs are as wide as tree trunks
Brought one size bigger and still to small....
The quality was poor.  It didn't fit right at all.  I was disappointed.
"Ordered ""infant"" for my 10 month old who is only 16lbs, 28inches long. I was sent the wrong size, a 1T-2T. This 1T-2T  almost fits but for the legs being too long. Torso and arms fit well.
I'm disappointed because I asked the seller which each size fit but they obviously don't know, my 10 month old is only in the 5th % growth, he's very small- the average 1 year old will be too big for this costume.
I want to exchange for the size I ordered but I wonder in that will even fit because old how small this stuff runs."
"Not happy with these gloves. First of all, the description doesn't state if they are for women or men but by the colors offered, I assumed they were for women. I feel I have an average to larger hand size so I ordered the large. They feel good initially after putting them but felt a little snug after zipping them up. Then my hands and fingers began to feel numb after a few minutes and I had to unzip them to feel relief. So as the seller recommends because they are an Asian seller, buy 1-2 sizes up. I should have bought X-large or XX-large. Next, it is touted as being ""waterproof"". I quickly ran my hand under water at my sink and the water beaded up and ran off but the second time, the water soaked through to my hand. Now the most disappointing, there are the rubber-like  ""Touch"" and ""Touch Screen Hand"" patches sewn on the glove. When seeing the pic listed, I guess I assumed they were just icons on the pic not an actual patch sewn on the gloves in two different areas. And last, the touch screen finger worked on my smart phone when I ""touched"" areas but not when I swiped my finger on the main lock screen. Had to take off the glove to do that. This product was provided at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
"I ordered an xl. Im 5'7"" 190 lbs and though it 'fit"", the buttons looked like they were busting open. I gave it to someone who normally wears a small, and it was baggy on her and the buttons still had that busting open look. The fabric quality was awesome though"
I WEAR A 40DD AND THIS BRA WAS VERY SMALL. NOT TRUE TO SIZE. PERSONALLY THIS BRA WAS NOT FOR ME.
"If you're seriously considering this watch, DON'T. I Just finished setting the watch up, and finding the quick guide absolutely useless, went online to the manual. The manual was not complete, so had to go to a YouTube demonstration to see how to set the contrast!!!. Why the contrast you ask? Because this watch will be useless in a bright sun and mostly useless in the dark. The nightlight function is terrible. I'm not sure what it's good for, except to give to my grandson who can't tell time anyway.  My Casio Pathfinder had finally started having problems, and that's why I looked at the Suunto. What I didn't do was pay more attention to the reviews. It doesn't make any difference how good it looks and how many things it can do if you can't read it. DON'T buy this watch. One star was too high, but required."
Bought this for a Christmas  gift for my daughter. What you get is a thin large scarf wit a button and a stronghold. Returning it asap.
Terrible.  Does not have any shaping or compression qualities and rolls down constantly. Don't waste your money.
"This was a waste of time. Did not fit the person I purchased it for. I also couldn't seem to find measurements anywhere which seems very odd especially for child measurements. Also it says ""black/natural fill"". Uhh.. Well it's just plain old blue! Or as we classically know it as ""Navy"".  Big hassle. Had to return it."
"I ordered a 9D. They fit like and a regular width 8. This is the second pair of New Balance that I have had to return because they are too small. I have worn New Balance for about 15 years. Perhaps someone knew makes them now.?  Looking them over, they still appear to be quality made however."
"The waist on these pants are terrible. My daughter is a slim 3 year old who wears other stretchy leggings in between a 3T and 4T. The waist on the 3T that we bought was large enough to fit a 5 year old, or like someone else said a baby was a diaper so full it's about to explode. The length was great and the color/jean thickness was nice but unless your child has the waist and butt of someone a few years older these likely won't work."
The top is too small and the bottom is too large.
"I've been buying Fruit of the Loom for many years with no problem.  This style is not the same.  The legs are wider and the elastic bottoms are not snug at all.  Even after laundering and putting in dryer, they didn't shrink enough.  I'm keeping them, but I won't wear them away from home."
icky fabric
Belt was okay and seemed like a great deal.  Till I started walking around with it and while waiting in line I noticed that it was just hanging by the loops. Upon further inspection I noticed that the buckle had come off or broken off which was held by a small metal piece about as big as a pencil lead.  I thought who does that?  It was a fairly cheap belt but I wish it could have withheld at least a couple wearing.
"I am 38DDD, 16/18, 5""3. I ordered 3XL. Not much support as far as fabric, when you are plus size support in swimwear is a neccessity. I love the look if the neckline but there is no support for chest area, so if you are top heavy and you need support you may not want to select this one. It looks appealing but in actuality there is no support."
These were way too small for what height said
"What a bizarre fit.
Sort of roomy, but so low-waisted that they cannot be worn to work.
Cheap fabric (think those bags made of recycled plastic bottles - although that fabric would actually be more comfortable that this).
Not sure what to do with them, really wish I hadn't bought them."
"I used to buy these socks years ago, but don't remember them being so scratchy. Sizing is right, but they just aren't comfortable to wear."
"Too narrow.  My husband owns a pair as well.  My feet fit on his better than mine...  Maybe, I have different bone structure since I'm Asian.  Maybe, these insoles will fit Western people's feet perfectly."
"I was pretty disappointed with the Klog Missions. I was looking for a good shoe to stand up in at work. I ordered the 7.5 and they were too small--my toes were touching the ends and I could barely get them on. I ordered the 8s and I couldn't keep them on they were so big. I loved the structure of the shoe, but ended up having to return both because neither fit. Disappointed with the big difference between half sizes. I would recommend to someone else, but you'd have to be the perfect size for them. Unfortunately my experience wasn't great."
took so frickin long to come! watch does not! fit all sizes either!!
"I want to love these so much because they are very cute and my son loves paw patrol. Unfortunately, they are meant to both fit either foot but in the end it means they look like you constantly have the wrong shoe on the wrong foot. It makes it hard to walk in them because they slightly curve out."
See earlier review.  Disappointed that lights were not working properly.
"Way too chunky and uncomfortable, which surprised me because normally I find Merrell shoes to fit my feet well and be quite comfortable.  Lots of rubbing."
"Odd fabric, smelled yucky and the arms width was crazy narrow while the length was long. It was white and looked like the photo."
Very average and not that nice looking.
Returned. The seam came out.
"The product itself is soft, comfortable and appears to be nice for the upcoming cooler weather.  They are not very thick though so probably will not be good in the harsh of winter. I was sent the wrong color. The plastic packaging it comes in says ""wine red"" but the leggings were clearly red and tagged as such inside the plastic packaging."
It was cheap looking
"I love this headband. Unfortunately it gets one star from me because I have purchased about 20 of them from various places like Amazon, Target, Ulta. They ALL break after a very short amount of time. I bought a 3 pack thinking I would be safe. Nope! All broke within the month."
Quality of the material looks thrown together and cheap. will not even give this to my friends a s a gift.
A little small.  The straps were not as sturdy as the Jansport products I am use to.
its too hard to get one of the legs in as it is cut too high. the material is soft enough.
I had to return this because the cotton did not seem to breathe well.  Very feminine and pretty.
Sizing is not standard sizing. I ordered a medium which is normally a size 8. This shirt in a medium is a 10-12.
"too narrow, too small,"
Very sheer and look cheap and flimsy.
"This is an awesome looking bracelet, but it smelled so musty, it stunk up my entire bedroom. Gave 2 stars for the look of it. It gets a zero for the smell."
"Had to return belt because it runs very, very small. Ordered XL and it measured 38 inches. Recommend ordering 1 or 2 sizes bigger. The belt did appear to be good quality."
Sweater easily unravels. I purchased two sweaters in different colors and both had holes after one wear to work where I sit at a desk all day. Thoroughly disappointed in the quality - or lack thereof.
"I was SO excited to get these because I had a pair several years ago that were amazing...sadly I was disappointed this time. The fabric was not soft inside and the fit was definitely tight (I recommend sizing up if you choose to buy these). Also, they developed holes in the fabric on my bum, near the seam at the top of my thigh area after I had worn them only 3 or 4 times. The only plus was they do look like jeans and they have real pockets."
Too  too big - I won't wear them but was not worth sending them back since they were only $2
"I'm a pretty small guy. 5,8 140lbs. Bought the 30X32. I can barely put it on and once it is on, it is sooo uncomfortable, especially the crouch area."
"Made the mistake of not reading all the reviews on these jeans before buying so was surprised when they were too tight and extremely glittery. They don't look anything like the picture at all. They look like a 12 year olds pair of jeans so yeah, I am not going to wear them. Luckily they were only 10 dollars so not a lot of money wasted."
This bra kind of squished everybody instead if supporting them. Also it was pinchy in strange places. Not satisfied but it could just be my taste in bras.
"The left hsnd stretcher came aprt upon use and I had to ""Jury rig"" it to get to function at all.  They DO NOT stretch the shoes in a useable manner.  I stronly DO NOT recommend these devices."
Cheap Cheap Cheap sent it back in a flash the material was as thin as panty hose
"Had to return, unfortunately. The tongues of the shoes are stiff and high. They dug right into the front of my ankles. Definitely would be painful to ride in."
I ordered a large and it could fit a small child. I waz looking forward to spice things up but I can't wear it and I'm usually between a med and lg in regular US sizes.
"This is a really nice shoe, but the width is way too narrow. Bought a size larger thing that would compensate. I would've had to cut the canvas to give it more room. To bad they don't make this shoe in a wider width."
"Comfortable, but developed holes after one wash"
I did not like the way these fit. I have bought NYD before and loved them these must have been 2nds or something.
"The page states: ""Body/pocket Bag: 100% Polyester""  NO.  They are 80% COTTON 20% POLYESTER.  If you're looking for these for cold weather/wicking, they are not what you want.  Will return and will probably, as usual for Amazon, be a clean transaction, but I just wasted over a week waiting for these, which I need, and now have to start over."
"I guess rompers are not made for people with long torsos! 5'8"" 170lbs ordered a large fits great every where but major camel toe"
"Received a TINY hat with a ""knitted"" look and not the pink beret that is pictured...not worth my time or money to return.  Gave it to a mother with a small child at the grocery store. This product was a BIG disappointment!  I have several berets in different colors and was really looking forward to the pale pink that I ordered."
"Too big, I'm a 6-1/2...very rough feel and not worth the price"
Huge! Two people could have fit into the size I ordered. Returned item...
These are a bit smaller than I expected and they snag on the Velcro of my boys' shoes.
Bad bad bad quality.
Too small and the fit was off
"This is not my favorite lb top.. Just ok! I have a lot of lb tops and this 1 is nice looking, lace is pretty, fits true to size but it's not very comfy and after a wash some of the lace ripped in all 3 shirts I bought! Disappointed with that.. So these will be lounge tops.."
"Firstly, The headpiece wasn't even included in the bag with the rest of the costume. So I have no headpiece. Second, the top just fits weird. It's too big, (I bought a large seeing as how I am a size 10) and it is not adjustable. The skirt is pretty cute and the gloves. The eye piece hurts a lot but is kinda cute."
Too bad product!
The soles were detached!
"I ordered this in 2X for my husband, and it doesn't fit him at all.  It actually fits ME like an XL in women's would.  Disappointing.  Order at least a size up--2 if you want it a bit baggy."
"They changed their manufacturers. I have worn 514s for ten years, and suddenly my measurements don't fit anymore. I have not gotten taller, that's for sure."
"I ordered two flannel shirts from Mak.  They were both sized Large and they were tight all around and especially at the armpit.  I'm 6' 2"" and only 180 lb.  One of the shirts was sewn off center so the the bottom buttons were a couple of inches to the right of my belt buckle. The buttons were sewn on extra poorly."
"I normally wear a size 45(11) but I like to buy a size up just to be safe. These are just plain ridiculous. First off, the tag says 12/45 which are two separate sizes. Weirdly enough, it is neither. Being so small I think it's actually a 10.

Add to the fact that it cost me $50 to ship a $30 item to Nigeria, that made it all the more frustrating."
"These sandals are super light-weight, but look kind of cheap and weren't particularly comfortable.  They were returned.  Not worth it for the price."
"When I saw these boots I just had to have them I loved the style and the color so I quickly ordered them. When my package arrived I was so happy . Ok when I first opened the package it came in it was torn badly, next the boots were not wrapped in plastics bags then when I took them out the box I noticed they had been worn then with first examining I saw the boots where very dirty on the toe of the boot . I was so up set I put them back in the box and took the package back to UPS for return the same day."
Ridiculously tiny compared to photo.
Oh my gosh this was like getting a bathing suit fitted for a child. There was no slip included with garment so I couldn't return it
The mint color is really ugly. The size and fabric are great.
"It come with a crack like scratch a very obvious a visible one. I am returning it, so sad cuz I really need it for my video project."
Did not look or fit at all like the photo. I returned it.
These shoes have a hard sole and upper making them very uncomfortable. I returned them.
"Zero support and after 2 hours, they have stretched out to 2 sizes, too big.
Amazon Customer Care took great care of the problem though."
"Extremely (like 3 sizes) too small - Color and style was fun and cute, but I ended up giving these away due to the small size."
"No separation or support so your shoulders hurt.
H h h h h h h h h h h h"
Zippers open very very easily. You get what you pay for
Excellent cushion for comfort but way to much shoe for my foot.
"I look like a burrito with to much lettuce inside, which is an awful thing to have in the first place"
Very nice shoe but much too narrow
"It looks so pretty in the pic, the design and the colors but in person not so good quality. They are very big unlike the pic."
"Ordered XL, received small. And yes, we did not get black. We got blue. Gave them to my sister who wears men's shorts as pajamas. Instead of a seam up the middle in the back, there's like a panel. I don't know if that makes them more comfortable, but it sure makes them look comical. Not sexy at all, guys. Ad picture should not show black and grey and should show back of shorts."
Not quality sweats
"I returned it
Too wide very heavy"
Cheaply made shoes especially for how much they ask. I sent mine back.  Never again in my life will I consider buying a shoe with the sperry label. The shoe offered no support all around.  No cushion for the sole of the feet.  Clarks shoes are a much better quality.
Great color but had to return.  Really small and that was the xxl
"its asking about shoes these questions. well these are sunglassses. these are the WORST SUNGLASSES I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. they are crooked, way too big, slide off my face, untighten after an hours use. extremely disappointing buying a pair of designer sunglasses to find out for them to become such crap...."
"The first time I used it, the weather was raining and windy.....the umbrella collapsed! I WAS SOAKED. not an umbrella for a windy rain."
"Way too small, it said Large but more like XSmall"
"I usually don't like Gerber cloths dues to their awkward fit. However i really loved that design so thought about buying this in bigger size, i know Gerber is usually not good with sizing.
Big Mistake!! 12 month size was still tight for my 7 month Baby!!
I like carter's better. Really soft and their sizes last even when babies pass the age requirements."
Poor quality. Do not buy.
Came from China.  It's cheaply made and the red is much brighter than what I thought I ordered.
"I like the way the shoes look, minus the laces. The orange laces are painfully bright and look cheap. The brown ones aren't much better- they're just much thicker and fuzzier than typical dress shoe laces.

The break-in period is real. I've been stretching these shoes with some XL shoe trees I have for the past few days and it's improving them, but the pain for the first few days was pretty serious. You will wear these shoes on your face - someone even asked me if I was okay on the first day breaking them in, because I was limping and looked in pain.

May return these still, but other than the laces and the god-awful bruises on my feet they look pretty nice. The leather is not quality though, and I would agree with another review that they it is possibly fake. Not sure if they're worth the price overall."
Way to baggy - felt like I was wearing clown pants.  Big in the waist as well.  Would not recommend to anyone who wants pants that have a modern fit.
"Not great quality, you get what you pay for. Lots of hot glue strings hanging off of the clips. Wish the clip was a bit smaller so it would stay in place better."
The lines on the shirt were not part of the material it was a decal/sticker. When I washed it it came off! Ended up throwing shirt away. Totally disappointed. Never buying again.
"The 7.5 size in gold must be incorrectly sized - these shoes were gigantic. I have three other pairs of Aerosole ballet-style flats, all in 7.5. These truly felt like 9-9.5. Hoped to exchange them but nothing in size 6-7 - probably because they were so large."
"Fitting size chart does not reflect actual size for this style.. Hated to pay for return on two tris at getting correct fit.
A different style, same brand, fit as expected..  Probably won't order again.."
My daughter got these as a present; and they are not like any Cushe's that I have ever purchased. Very disappointed in them. They LOOK awesome but are already showing major signs of wear....bottoms inside and out look like she has worn them for two summers. Not well made...so bummed out because they look great; the black straps are fine....she has worn them four times; and to look that wiped out!?  And has only worn them shopping....so no major trips or time on them. I would send them back if I could.
"RETURNED. IT WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN EXPECTED AND NEEDED. HOWEVER, IT LOOKED VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED."
My wife had to fill with paper the free space in the shoes.
Shrunk on first wash!
The link broke the moment I use it.... not very sturdy....
"When I asked everyone what shoe to get my son- responses were always ""Hands down, StrideRite!""

However, within weeks of purchasing these, the stitching started coming undone.  It was especially bad around the holes near the big toe- which made it very uncomfortable for my son and his toe would often be red after taking these off because the lose stitch would rub. I also got him sized beforehand at our local StrideRite store, but ordered them on Amazon since they were cheaper.  After a few hours of wear, his feet are often red with strap marks.  He never shows sign of discomfort but just makes me believe that these could run a bit small."
"I used to wear Costco's Hathaway knit boxer briefs, but cant get them anymore so looking for a replacement.  I thought i'd found them here, but ultimately not.  I saw the reviews saying they run small, and since i would normally wear a medium (33 waist), I ordered a Large.  And they actually fit pretty nice everywhere except the waistband. And even that is close, the problem is the elastic.  It's really very strong, so i'd guess it's fine if your fit is dead on perfect, but if a little snug in the waist, these are uncomfortable. They just don't ""give"" enough.  It's possible they would relax over time, but i know i won't wear them till they get that way. I just know it.
I even held them up next to my Hathaways and they are almost the exact same size, but the Hathaway waistband gives much more easily.  Bottom line: they just weren't comfortable for me.  I must say, they seem well made and were it not for this issue, i definitely would have kept them"
Hanes is MUCH better.
"DISAPPOINTED... I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS JACKET WAS A FARCE AS SOON AS I READ THE NAME OF THE JACKET... TOO MANY WORDS TO EXPLAIN ""STUDDED TUXEDO JEAN JACKET!"" & where they got TUXEDO out of it, I'm cramming to understand! I received this ""too cute to resist"" jacket 2 wks ago & have been trying to get a full refund since! We've been emailing back and fourth throughout the weeks because they said that it's hard to return things back to China, so originally they wanted to refund me  70% back & told me to keep the jacket or give it away & now weeks later they want to give me back a 50% refund! There's nothing that I or anyone else can possibly do with such a defective jacket! I'm from NY, I know good cut, style & material when I see it regardless of the price! #1: THIS JACKET READS KNOCK OFF as soon as you touch it because the material isn't denim, I don't know what it is!  #2: The sizing doesn't make sense. #3: It's defective. The shoulder pads aren't placed properly making the shoulders way off from not being fitted & sewn together properly. #4: The texture of the material isn't denim at all... I don't know what it is, but it screams possible FIRE HAZARD, which means ""WEAR AT YOUR OWN RISK!"""
arrived broken. Had to super glue the stone
"Well, I absolutely loved this necklace BUT it broke after not even two months. Literally the clasp just broke off - pretty disappointing. But it did look nice!"
"This necklace does have a felt backing like many have said and it's a little narrow for my neck. I don't even think I have a ""thick"" neck.... it flips up on the sides. Disappointed but the necklace is cute, just not functional for me. Maybe I'll give to my preteen niece."
Way too large. Ridiculous
"You've got to be kidding me! 1) The picture shows three underwear and you only get one. TOTALLY MISLEADING! 2) Basic underwear - not very good quality... maybe worth 2.00
Don't buy these underwear! You'd get better quality and price at sears. It's the truth. Calvin Klein - you totally ripped me off!"
"I ordered 2 sizes up and the sleeves are still too short.  Cute top, but if you're above average height, I'd skip this one.  I'm 5'9"", 140 lbs, and I ordered a large"
"too loose, slips off feet even with inserts."
Love it. But way too small. Contacted the seller. No response.
Runs small this is for 3-4T which is not specified in the product
HUGE and HEAVY {literally!)
Size mispresented
This belt is leather inside and plastic outside.  I can't believe Cole Haan would make such an inferior product.  Do not recommend.
Bought these for my daughter to wear around D.C. Day 2 of wearing it on our trip and the loop of the back strap used to pull them on is already coming apart. Comfort is 5 stars but this quality  is ridiculous...
Yo get wha tyou pay for short when tucked in and the sleeves shrank first washing.
Very disappointed. Recieve another pair of crocs.  Not what i pay for. Need this to be replace.
It is not true to size and does not fit. AND I ORDERED MY SIZE!!!!!!!!!! So disappointed its not even funny.
"Only good for the first few times. After couple washes, they started to slip off my feet."
Looks to fake
"I bought these boots for my wife because they had generally good reviews, looked good and because the last pair of snow boots she had been using wore out.  Unfortunately, the boots she received while fitting well, were poorly constructed.  And that is being generous.  A seam on the inside of the left boot running down her calf to her ankle was not sewn shut.  As a result, when she put the boot on, the inner materials of the boot cut into her ankle.  Even with that, she wanted to exchange them for the same boot, but obviously one that had been fully completed at the factory.  No dice.  Amazon changed the price from $55 to $165 for the same boot.  $165 for a shoddily built boot that is nice, but not THAT nice?  No.  Don't bother with these."
"Paid $12.50

These jeans appear to be decent quality for such an affordable price - however, they run very small & I was unable to wear them.
The front pockets appear to be large which is a positive.

I suggest ordering a size larger"
"I wear a 32C  or a 34B.  And this bar is really tight.  I guess if you want a bra that squishes your boobs, holds them and no wobbles, you should get this. I was expecting a more comfortable fit."
Dont come with the belt
The 2X one was a bit too large so I got the XL. Now the XL is way too tight and rolls up. Uphappy with both and really confused how the sizes are so extreme. Really confusing.
"Really poor quality, the zipper broke not even a month after using it, disapointing, I should have listen to the other reviews."
I snagged it the first time I wore it. I put it through the washer and dryer and now it is ruined. I have many other scarfs and have never had one come out like this after being washed and dried.
"Lovely fabric but a bit of an odd cut.  Has a seam just below the waist line that makes it bulge funny in the tummy.  I thought it was odd and just probably hung funny on me, but then my very thin 24 year old daughter tried it on and it fit her the same way :(  .  I also have very small shoulders and the cap sleeves were tight."
The dress is ok. The material is not good.
"Believe in the reviews that say the toe area runs very narrow. I wear a 10 B and there was no way I would be able to wear it at all. They are really cute so I was excited that they had a 10 C/D.  I ordered that size and had received it before returning the first pair.  When placed together, they are seemingly the same size. Not any wider in the toe area so they are going back also."
They fit really baggy. I'm looking for something more fitted. Returned these and went with the Condor Stealths.
"Nice looking but fits wide, back slides on heel."
This swimsuit is very cute but did not fit correctly at all - just fit kind of odd? I even had a friend of mine try it and it too fit her differently...
"Pros: Great fit. Haven't worn them out a lot yet, but no problems so far.

Cons: The smell is terrible and irritating, and  IT DOESN'T GO AWAY. I tried airing them out for two and a half days. I tried wiping them down. They are the first product I've ever come across and thought, ""A government agency should really look into the toxicity of this product.""

Unfortunately, I'd ordered another pair before I realized that the smell simply doesn't go away. I don't recommend others by these shoes."
"Liked this bag just ok!!!! If you want a bag that you can use everyday casual or dressy, this is not the bag!!!!"
"I bought 4 sackpacks (2 blue, 2red) from WORLWIDE SPORT SUPPLY. I like the design. It looks durable unless you overuse them  they will give up right away. The size is perfect for the gym, a day or 2 trip to the beach, vacation in lake tahoe or in san francisco. Really nice. BTW the packaging was very bad. I hate it. The reason why only gave 1 star."
The blue was faded really bad. Looked like 10 year old pants.
"Was just odd all around. Not meant for someone with a butt, didn't match up on both sides, unattractive ribbon, so you'll have to spend more money on different ribbon than the pants...will probably tear up and make a head band with it."
"T-shirt quality was horrible.. Shrunk and twisted after washing on cold and delicate dry. I guess that's totally punk rock though, but so is giving a lousy review for an inferior product."
"These shoes are flat and incredibly large, so I couldn't walk in them without them slipping off.  They were returned."
"Hat came in pretty crushed up. The hat hangs low, more like a bucket hat,not too impressed :("
"These shoes were sized well, but the sole fit my foot in a strange way-- big lump under ball of foot, sharp drop-off to toes.  The break came at a very uncomfortable place on my foot."
"The top part is a little bit loose for me the waist line is just right I bought size 8 and I am 5,1 and 115 lbs I normally wear size 6  so I have to return it I purchased blue color very nice color but it won't work for me the dress arrived so quickly."
"I wear Lg to XL depending on the brand. Usually with these novelty shirts I just order an XL and figure my hard water will shrink it and it'll fit okay. This shirt was an XL but fit almost like an XXL. I had a friend who wears XXL take a look at it & it seems to be closer to his size. Even if I shrunk it this shirt would be too large. The length was ridiculous! It comes down past crotch level. Maybe this shirt would make a good night shirt for a lady but for a dude who collects silly cat shirts it's not going to work. I'm returning it. COnsidering sizing down to LG but I'm still not sure about the length, if it would be too long or not."
small and very cheap looking
"After looking at the reviews, I decided to order my size and one smaller. Neither worked. These run extremely wide on the foot. I have an average with foot. The heel portion is quite tall which doesn't bother me if I put my orthodic in for my plantar fasciitis.  However, there's a bump there I can feel on my heel. Also, the instep part is on the wide side. All and in all, I had to send them both back. It's a shame as they are quite cute."
it would be hot for the summer
The lenses are too dark
Weird fit - cute dress - returned
"I wore this bra once, before the strapped broke."
"I had to send it back, it is NOT as pictured.  The photo shows a long tank, and this barely went past my waist.  If my arms were shoulder height it revealed my stomach.  Quality seemed fine, purple color was good, but it didn't work for me.  I'm only 5'8"" so not a giant by any means."
"Typical issue with online purchases - you never really know how things are going to fit until you try them on. I had a pair of Lee relaxed fit jeans from a clothing chain that I love. I haven't found those exact jeans again, so I thought I would try online. Nope. Oh well. And these were shipped without any kind of receipt or return information in the packaging. So much for returning them."
"Too small. I weigh 220 5'8"". Too short."
Very disappointed. Cheap quality.
It did not work at all.
"I couldn't fit this, the hood was weird and returning it would have cost over $100 for some reason. I just put it on the back of my chair."
the stones fell out.
The belt buckle was turned inside out.  Other than that I liked it
"Picture looks Cool, but way small- no man I know can fit this... Fell apart the minute I opened it to wrap it.  Lame"
Very narrow so extremely snug fit
It's supposed to be a shawl. Can't even wrap around once. Will not purchase from you again
"I am a real Salomon fan, and own several pair. All my other Salomon's fit true to size. This pair was not even close and were extremely uncomfortable. They  have been returned. This will not deter me from buying Salomon's in the future."
"Decorative stitching on top/sides causes sore, pressure spots on my B width/high-arched feet.  I can only wear them with socks  or with bandaids on bare feet for quick trips. Disappointed with these Clarks"
"Quality is, well, what you pay for it. Bulky rigid soles. Feels like your walking on styrofoam."
Returned because it would not hold its shape just lays flat. I like the size of the brim.
turn in black to soon
"My husband loves the fit of this boot...he has had so many people he works with compliment him on the look of the boot...but now after only six months of wear, and only working part time...the soul of the boot is separating at the toe.  Keens have always held up very well...kind of surprised and disappointed."
"I love them... so confortable... even my wife steals tem sometimes from me :))  Use them for inhouse, outhouse I use my Crocs or for more social events my Birkenstocks.

20th April 2010
Today I'm reviewing my rating... was 5, but now went down to 2... after 6 months of use they started showing small cracks all over... since there are so many small bumps on them (which are kind of nice to keep your blood circulation going), they accumulate dirt and are kind of difficult to clean... after a while start smelling bad.

After leaving them in the sun (forgot them for 3-4 hours), they bent completelly and now I can't use them anymore). Won't get them again..."
It came apart in two days. It's nice otherwise.
Not what I thought it was gonna be
Poor quality and small
"Shoes fit nicely and are great if I am in sitting in meetings or at my desk all day. I have owned  this pair for a couple months now, hoping to break them in;  the material is just too firm, very painful on top, where the shoe hits top of tow base. Not enough flex and forgiveness on days where I must do a lot of walking during the day. Luckily I have other reliable platform shoes for this however I am still looking for a true patent leather platform that will get me through a busy day!"
"Cheap fabric. Not supportive, but cute"
Made horribly!
"Not my favorite corset. I'm not exactly a pro corset-wearer, but I own around 7 and wear them whenever I can, and I don't know if I'll be wearing this one again. I wore it for the first time last night and two of the plastic boning pieces tore their way out. I was able to push them back in, but the holes they worked their way out of are still there. Not cool. Also, my breasts kept falling out of it all night. Pretty happy that I wore it as an undergarment and not by itself. The other purely aesthetic problem I had with it was the bow. When I ordered it I didn't care for the bow but figured I could cut it off. There is a piece of ribbon on each side of the front opening that tie together. It was also a little smaller than I expected, but that is likely a personal problem. On the positive side, it's very pretty. The material is very nice and silky and it looks pretty good.

To summarize: if you want this particular corset just for the bedroom, it might work out for you. If you want it as a foundation garment or to wear as a shirt, you should probably keep looking."
This product is horrible .. My daughter could have done a better job sewing this dress .. Still waiting on my refund and the product has been return !!
THERE WAS A STAIN OF ADHESIVE IN THE FRONT.
"Although the fit is true to the Lee Women's Slender Secret brand (which I love), this specific style is considerably shorter in the leg than the Flap Pocket style of the exact same size--so short I had to return them or risk hearing high water jokes."
"Very cheap.  They looked great upon arrival, but all 3 pair developed holes within a few weeks.  For the price, there are better products on the market."
Nice socks when you first get them. The heels all wore out in about 1 year.
Really run small waist small was very disappointed
Cute and light but no arch support at all. Had to return or risk the wrath of the PF gods.
FINISH IS TOO DULL
I still wore the heck out of it....but sizing chart was off on this one!
Very unattractive -- and I have nice looking feet.
"Material is stiff and uncomfortable. Fits awkward, really wide compared to length.  I prefer a longer top to cover everything when I'm moving all shift.  Seems like it's made tough at least.  I won't be wearing it though."
"Very disappointed with this dress. Upon receiving it, I noted that the fabric was  poorly made & very thin to the point of being nearly transparent. Not a good thing for a summer dress!  Having to wear a slip under this dress for modesty's sake would defeat the purpose of wearing it for summer outings, etc.  I returned this dress, as it was definitely not worth $32.95!  I doubt that I will order from this vendor again & Sadly, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this dress to anyone."
This dress is so cheap it went directly in the trash. I should've known. My mistake.
"This is not meant for a slender guy.  Length is perfect but it's big around the chest area so someone bigger might fit better.  It runs long if you like it like that.  My husband is 6 feet tall and it was even just a tiny bit longer than he would normally wear.  Texture of the shirt is normal, not really soft.  I imagine it needs a few washes to be comfy."
Completely see through.  I would like a refund.
Was shipped in a timely manner. I felt like necklace was cheap looking.
"This was a gift.  The front of the shoe was too narrow, ( Wear a wide) and the rear was too loose.  I like Sloggers better."
had to return them .  just didn't fit my foot right .
"Tag split open in the airport and luckily someone pointed it out to me as my information card was lying on the ground. Fortunately I had purchased a spare which was one of those ""jellie"" ones and that worked out fine."
"Runs big. The cut is okay in the chest area, but too wide around the waist and too short for me. I'm 5'4"" & it hits on the hips in a place that makes me look super hippy and stumpy. Also the bicep area has too much room for me. I usually go with small, so was kind of nervous ordering an X-small for fear this would be the dreaded Junior fit (which I have to wear a M or L in), but this fits more like a women's M or L would on me. Just too big. That aside, the cut is really the problem for me. It looks like I'm wearing an inflated paper bag, albeit a very pretty one.

This would be a good fit for a triangle-shaped person or even just someone with slim hips. This shirt would hide a spare tire and some batwings like a boss.

The quality is really nice! Good quality stitching and decent workmanship all around. Wish it would've worked out because the shirt is stylish in a universal you-don't-have-to-be-western to wear it and the snaps are classy. Good luck finding your fit, ladies!"
"I read the reviews and was on the fence about this item. I was envisioning a danty, simple strand across my neck. I figured for the price, what the heck?! As soon as I got it, I was skeptical and almost wanted to send it back without taking it out. But I did and put i around my neck. It's so small, I couldn't see it standing in front of my bathroom mirror. I wouldn't recommend this item for any kind of charm or pendant. It's just not strong enough. It's so light weight, I actually sent it back in a regular envelope with one postage stamp."
"The chain was nice, the cross was very light weight and cheap looking. I would Not buy this again."
These pants were weird. They fit me around the wait and around the calfs but they were baggy from the knee up. These pants were just steaight up strange.
"When I opened the package, the winding mechanism was broken. The second hand also made a very loud ticking sound, more so than other watches. I can't recommend this."
The velcro ripps off fast and we have to sew it ourselves. I don't think its supportive enough for the first time walkers. their feet seems to be too out of order anyway when they walk and these shoes don't seem to do a good job.
tooo small does not fit at all....
"This shirt was just overall a no.  My tall husband ordered the XL, the sleeves barely fit in length and they were very tight.  The shirt looked like something from a  Night at the Roxbury.  It's being returned ASAP"
this shirt is awful. it almost gas a shine to it and it fits super small. you have to wait for an approval for a return and then are stuck paying shipping costs!? do not waste your money
"I hate these shoes. They aren't as slip resistant as other shoes, so beware. The back of my foot flopped around so much in this thing that the heel cushion wore away, and left sharp edges exposed. I relaced these suckers numerous times to get them to stay put, but no dice. I can't wait to throw them in the trash. Also, the padding sucks. If you work on your feet for many hours a day like I do, look elsewhere. I had to line them with gel pads in order for my feet not to throb in pain every shift."
Really want to keep them. They are cute but really hurt my feet
"not as nice as it looked in the photo, afraid the amber will fall out"
"Definitely more red than burgundy, disappointed."
"This used to be one of my favorite brands of boat shoes.  Now they are made in China and are not sized even remotely correctly.  The shoes are too short and they are too tight even with the laces loosened.  I measured them against the existing pair in my closet and they are definitely shorter.  So I ordered a bigger size and they were a tiny bit longer but also too short but still too tight.  Consequently all were returned.  Why can't we get stuff made in some country that does not cheat us on sizing?  What happened to quality control?  I am just not going to order anything else made in China whether it is shoes, electronics, clothes, or light bulbs.  I'm done."
"Rim is too floppy and the top of my head got baked on a kayaking trip. ZERO UV protection. That is dry, get this thing wet and you have even more floppiness to deal with. Also the cord is permanently attached ... so if you don't want it you  have to cut it out."
"Ordered 2 sizes. None of them fit right. What is worse, i returned the first dress and looking to return the other one, but it says that i jave already returned it."
"Large is SO not large...maybe a large child...certainly not an adult hat.  Chintzy material, but I should have expected that - you do get what you pay for."
I thought the bracelet was too flimsy and it was too twisted I was afraid to untwist so it doesnt break
"Love the pattern, the fit, and the feel, and the price.  This pair developed a hole upon first wearing from the seam at the seat."
"I ordered these for my granddaughter and returned them because they were too difficult to get on. The top strap is not the best design, and these would usually be worn with bare feet which make them even harder to get on and off. Keen needs to rethink this design."
I received my swimsuit today and the fringe ion the top is very short in the middle but long on the sides like a shark took a bite out of it. It does not look like the photo at all. I was really excited about the swimsuit but I wanted the fringe as pictured. :(
"The photo makes this necklace looks much nicer than the actual item. In person it looks cheap and tacky. The quality and workmanship is very poor. The lobster clasp wouldn't open.  I had to actually take a pair of pliers to force the lobster clasp open.  Additionally, the seller didn't bother to take enough care when packaging and shipping so both posts on the earrings were bent backward when I received the package.  Disappointed but for the price, I guess I should have known it wasn't going to be a high quality item."
"I was very excited to get this bracelet. However, halfway through the first day I wore it I was washing my hands and noticed that the water in the sink was pink. I then looked at my bracelet and saw that the purple color was washing out- several of the beads were completely clear already! I returned the bracelet; if I wanted one with clear beads I would have ordered one with clear beads."
"Love the colors it's the only reason I gave 2 stars. Cheap materials, they move all over and roll down. The back is cute when it's not sliding up your bum. So if you like walking around with your hands down your pants adjusting your panties then you have found the perfect match for you."
These socks are pretty tight fitting as I prefer a little loosier..
"It looks good ,but I thought the material was better, it is too simple. I know is a copy but I thought it was better. If I have yo buy this againg I won't."
had to give these away because the pants were a couple of inches too short.  I'm 5'7 1/2 and they were high waters.
"So the strings on this thing are terrible!!! Its a super cute cover up, but do not get it wet!!! I did go to the beach so maybe it was the salt, but the strings just fell apart and wrapped all over my legs. It was pretty annoying. Its a little boxy too, like my booty didn't stay very covered. I'm about a size 12 and 5' so that was disappointing. But it was comfortable and cute so I gave it 2 stars. Plus it came with a cute necklace."
I ordered small but it's still way too large for me.  The fabric is very thin and overly stretchy so the dress just drapes on my body in a not very flattery way.
"I bought these because of the good reviews but am very disappointed- these are NOT waterproof!! If I could give zero stars, I would.  My 3.5 likes to splash in big puddles and even with snowpants or rainsuit pants placed over the legs of the boots, they quickly become soaked. Almost as if the water penetrates or is absorbed by the fabric/plastic material on the legs. What's even worse is that they smell awful now because of the moisture- you can take out the sole pad and dry it but the lining of the boots and material on the sides don't dry well even when placed in front of a hot furnace. I can't figure out who to contact but we are outside of the return window anyway. Wish I could get my money back!! Save yourself the hassle and buy truly waterproof rubber rain boots!!"
Turned brown after one wearing
"These didn't work at all, they came torn, and don't work."
"Very cute dress (except for those floppy butterfly sleeves), but it's MUCH SHORTER than I anticipated.  I wanted a maxi length, and this hits right below my knees.  I'm not particularly tall (5'4"") so the description is misleading.  Returned for credit."
"Waist fit as I thought it would, but I ordered 36"" inseam, and they sent me un hemmed.  Was not expecting having to deal with the hem.
Nice quality, just poor, or inaccurate description, that causes me hassle and extra expense to get the hem fixed."
"Didn't fit like I was expecting. The style was very different from pictured; the sleeves were more square and the fit didn't seem to be junior-sized. Plus, the white shamrock was much larger than pictured. Returned and got refund."
Super cute bracelet but remember you get what you pay for and this just seems a little cheaply made. I only wear it occasionally as I'm afraid it might break.
"I have owned this bag and the smaller version of it at least 7 or 8 times.  I bought the small version to downsize what I carried around everyday to the bare minimum and then switched to this larger version to be able to carry a bit more without weighing myself down.  The multiple pockets, compartments, zippered, mesh for visibility, hidden pockets to discretely carry feminine items and most of all the easily accessible cell phone holder  was and is ideal for me.  I'd carry these bags for years until I wore them out through much wear and tear.  Completely reasonable amount of use for a non-leather bag.  I'd just pop on Amazon and get another one.  Women stopped me on the street to ask about the bag.  I loved it...until last year when the quality changed. I wonder if Travelon was sold or has switched to a cheaper manufacturer.  The nylon used for the bag is stiffer and less pliable than it was, the strap is a little flimsier, the zippers are of lower quality and the magnetic fasteners are cheaper and don't hold as well.  The velcro fastener that holds the cell phone ripped off.  I sewed it back on.  I bought a brown version of the bag earlier this year -- the zipper on the front pocket broke - I actually sewed it back together which held for a while but then became unusable.  No problem.  Ordered a black version.  Received it on Oct. 24.  As of today, Dec. 8, the strap has completely detached from the cell phone holder.  It is literally held on by two threads and I'm in danger of the bag falling of my shoulder.  I just spent hours searching hundreds of bags for a replacement and let me tell you there is no replacement that will be as convenient and affordably priced as this bag.  I finally settled on the Tumi Voyageur Lugano Messenger which is much much more expensive and still not as good as the Travelon.  I am writing this review both as a warning to others and a plea to Travelon, please go back to your other manufacturer.  This bag is one of a kind and its a shame for it to be in the state its in now."
Runs large. Design and cut looks different than pic.
I was hoping that the strap around the heel would keep them from flopping around too much but they were very loose and too squishy to feel supportive.  The bottom was so soft you could feel every bump on the ground.  Glad I got them on prime day sale for $20 because they definitely aren't worth full price.  They are cute so I gave them 2 stars instead of one but I already gave them away to a neighbor since they weren't even comfy enough to the wear to the pool.
"Looks nice and like it's going to be warm. Fit as expected but it didn't come with the hat and scarf that's in the picture. It's coming from China so it will take awhile to come in.

UPDATE: My daughter has worn this coat maybe 5 times and it's already ripping in the button hole."
They look cheap. Look like a doll shoes.
"Purchased these with the expectation or being taken magically away to far away places, and yet nothing of the sort just blisters on my heels which my podiatrist says is from clicking my heels incessantly."
"wont last forever, but cute shoe and I enjoy a bunch of colorful spring and summer flats.  comfy and price is good"
"This box has a cheap, broken latch and cheap cardboard inserts that fit loosely in the box and move around and have rough edges. The inserts are too small and watches fall off of them and rattle around inside of the box. The outside looks nice but is also cheap to the touch. I am looking for a way to return. Very disappointing as I sent this as a gift to my fianc who is stationed overseas. I do not recommend as there are better options available and I am very disappointed and confused about why this product has such good reviews."
"Very thin and wrinkled.  Also my daughter's normal size 10/12 did not fit so we exchanged for a larger size, also did not fit...returning again."
"These were ordered for a gift, size was a woman's not a childs - too large!  Cannot fairly review the quality of the product."
"One cannot simply increase all the measurements of a bra designed for average cup sizes and sell it to larger-breasted women.  Shape and fit must be considered, comfort tested.  The straps cut across from my underarm, making me an odd shape.  Who would want to appear as if they had two large breasts in the usual location and two extra, teeny breasts next to your underarms?  Not I, so I returned this disaster."
"THE ITEM WAS VERY NICE, WELL CONSTRUCTED AND VERY NICE FABRIC BUT VERY STRANGE SIZING.  BODY SIZE IS FINE, LENGTH IS VERY LONG AND SLEEVE LENGTH IS VERY LONG AS WELL.
I AM SENDING IT BACK.  LINDA"
Chincy material and way small. The logos in brown were some sort of strange face...
"I like the idea of this product, however it is short. It needs to be longer. Doesn't fully cover the stomach at the bottom. Today, just three months later, I'm disappointed to report that the Velcro doesn't seem to stick anymore, making this product pretty much useless. Really ashame."
"Oh Em Gee. If you want these to fit, order at least 2 sizes bigger than your regular store-bought pant size. If you want wiggle room in them make it 3 sizes.  I ordered my regular pant size and could barely get them on, let alone button them. No way, no how.  Had to pay to return them, was not happy AT ALL."
I never wear this. It looks way too plasticy..almost like a costume accessory.
"Made of good quality strong materials, but had two dirty marks on it and was too small despite me following the size chart. Returning."
"These are a lot less cute than they looked in the photo, and much smaller than they should be for the size. I was not impressed."
"I loved these when I first got them, nice fit, snug, keeps the cold out.
I'd have easily given them 5/5 stars and indeed I did before the first big storm, then I wore them for days and found them amazingly bad.
Here's the scoop, they are absolutely fantastic snow boots, they really do their job and keep your feet warm.
But walking on other flat surfaces, slightly damp marble or smooth cement - was a total catastrophe.  It was like being on ice.
I don't know what it is with the soles but they were hydroplaning horribly, total loss of traction, absolutely horrible.
If you're out in the woods or natural grounds and earthy materials all the time, no problems.
If you live in the city and travel diversely from pavement to subway platforms to different buildings, avoid these like the plague.
You will slip, and even walking carefully with great caution, you will slip.
On that note, I regret buying these, approach with caution."
I returned this shoe... because of the brand I thought it would be comfier but it was not made for me.
Only got shirt!
Much bigger than expected very gaudy I was expecting small quarter size or less these are like the size of a child's hand and the stones are very fake looking as is the whole thing. OK for a teen or costume but not every day kind of look.
"I bought these for my 5 month old daughter who is on the big side (17lbs), but listened to the reviews that said the boots sized large so to size down. I got size 1-2 and they were way too small. I think they might have fit, but I couldn't get her foot in past the back of the shoe- it's like the stitching prevents you from putting them all the way on. I'm going to return these and get the ones that have velcro on the back."
"It looks better on screen, seems velvety in person. Also runs a bit small and narrow."
Does not conform to size indicated.
"The tag on this black and white pair said ""curvy"" meaning generous in upper calf area but this pair is very tight and constrictive on my 15 inch calf. Strangely enough the red and black pair are wonderfully comfortable. This pair is either mislabeled or not manufactured properly to size."
Looks cute but breaks easily. My sister was wearing it and one of the pieces just fell off. We fixed it but the quality is not what I hoped.
"I did enjoy how these brighten things up a bit, however.. The frames broke within a week of use. These may be best suited for someone with a small head. Perhaps women and children?"
Terrible quality and very cheap looking
this bra has absolutely no padding at all. the lining is very thin and pointed. the quality is not the FREYA I'm use to buying. I buy Freya bras for support and comfort. The underwire was extreme and overall it was a very uncomfortable bra. I'm not even sure what type of clothing this bra could be worn under.
I want to like them. But I can't walk in them at home for a minute. The front have very little room for my toes. They don't look as good on my feet as in picture. If you have narrow feet then they might work.
"I wasn't happy with these sandals, I thought it would be the same fit as the ECCO Yukatan, so I had to return it."
"On the top the fabric becomes too spliced, it looks like you see a ball. The dress is nice but not at the time of putting it makes you look fat from the top"
"too lady like for a man, have returned it, but very beautiful."
"Sadly this is being returned.  The material did not feel like swimsuit, it felt more like a leotard.  The cut was also not flattering.  This is more of a hipster style than a bikini style.  Also, this is MAXIMUM coverage in the back which means they have the tendency to look like something an older lady might wear.  My suggestion, there are other options on Amazon that offer same suits for similar pricing, look elsewhere."
"I ordered an extra large per the sizing chart, and ended up giving it to a friend because it was about a medium. If you have any girth at all this will not fit."
Too slim in the thigh area.
Doesn't have my size.
"I guess you just can't buy good underwear anymore.  These are so short they feel like speedos....I wish Dockers would bring back their old style, that's how I ended up here..."
I returned it. Too flimsy
Legs are baggy and loose
Socks slide down my heel to bottom of foot after a few minutes ...they fit OK but have a design flaw or do not have enough elastic to hold them up. Thorlos does allow you to return them so I am stuck with a $13 sock that is useless. Even cheap socks stay on your feet; not these.
"Very small. I decided to keep and not return. A seam came undone within a week. Poor quality, you get what you pay for."
I recently had a double mastectomy and needed to quickly get some button down blouses.  I  am petite size yet wanted to be fashionable which is why I ordered this blouse but it was way too small.
THE BAG WASN'T FOR ME.
"will slowly slide down and off your heel, ( come off )"
"I ordered a size that should have been a bit roomy but instead the shoes turned out to be way too small.  Had they fit, they would have been OK.  These shoes have an elasticized heel, which was not obvious to me from the picture.  Had I realized that, I would not have purchased because I don't like elasticized heels (YMMV)."
juck
It was hell trying to get them up my legs. Awkward crotch and very little stretch to them.
Sized for MAN hands and not petite lady hands
"I purchased a 2nd pair of crocs for my  husband, this time in a different style (DC Realtree Clog).  Apparently each type of croc shoe is different when it comes to the inner material used for the shoe lining.  This particular style had the normal 'bumpy' type of in-sole material except that the little bumps in it were so hard, that it hurt my husband's feet.  They were too sharp of an insole compared to other croc styles.  I tried them on myself and they actually HURT the soles of my feet.  We promptly returned them for a refund.  I would NOT recommend this particular style.  Loved the look, but wear-ability was a zero."
I've order three pair of these feathers earring and I love them all..
Cheap necklace.  I would not buy again.  I will give to a teenager or child for play jewelry.
"no support at all, cut too shallow, didn't end up wearing them"
"HIDEOUS.  Black and shiny, cheap, tacky gold edging.  Not as described.  Nowhere in the description or photos did it mention this thing was edged all over with the cheapest 'gold' thread - just Awful.  I would not give this to the thrift store."
Even after taking into account the size they were too small. Good fabric
"they arrived damaged and not at all as described. i don't know what they would have been like if they had been the gradient lenses the listing said they were, not solid nearly black, and had the frames not been warped. i was not offered a refund."
neck area is too wide it just hangs on your upper chest. i thought it would at least cover part of my face and it was too tight from what i usually wear
"Fell apart at the seams right out of the box.  I probably could have returned it but the fabric felt so cheap and was clearly poorly made, I didn't want to go through the hassle.  I love the design and it looked the same as the picture. :("
"I ordered my normal size, 9.5B, and these shoes were at least 1 size off."
It looks good but I ordered a size larger than I needed for my daughter & it is too short heel to toe.
These sandles run very small. Lost my window of return and no exchange.
"My advice - check the shoes well! I got two right feet ones. I looked at them, when they arrived, but did not ""see"".  Only saw later, when dressing little one for wedding ."
Still new has hole in crotch and its not the size they are plenty big and long
way tooo wide
I returned these shoes.  They were far too flashy for my taste!
way too small for my hands and i do not have very big hands.  I ended up giving them to my wife.
These shades lasted one month and they were broken. I wouldn't buy them again. I just went on the actual ray ban site and purchased the club master and I love them! These were a waste of 80 bucks.
"I read the reviews and thought this was a great value. And at first, I was very happy with the quality of the chain. However, After about a week and a half, I noticed it tarnished very quickly to a brown color. Since then, Ive tried cleaning it regularly with every (jewelry specific) silver cleaning product I can think of And within about a week and a half to two weeks it turns to a rusty brown color all over again. So while this seems like a good value in the beginning, its a maintenance nightmare. Spend more on a quality chain."
"More of a shirt, than a dress. Ugh"
"This is made of a sheer mesh, not chiffon or otherwise flowy material. Such little gathering at the waist.  just goes straight down, minimal fabric. 5'6"" 113 and this was HARD TO GET ON! Seriously?? The waistband stretches but the stitching doesn't. POS item don't waste your time."
leather is hard and the strap does't look good.
"These boots are SUPER....But WAY WAY WAY WAY small on the calf.  I am 5'6, 150 pounds and my calf measures 14.75"" around the largest part of the calf.  These boots actually come in just a tiny bit at the top, and although the rest of the boot fits just fine in my typical size, the top of the boot just kinda cuts into my lower leg and is very uncomfortable.  (This is wearing them with just short socks so no additional padding added.)  Unfortunately, I cannot return them at this point, so I will be needing to figure out a way to modify the boot in order to wear them."
This is a cotton shirt. Does not lay right with the elastic band on the bottom. It is also short. Honestly I put it on and its made cheap and didn't look right. This one is being returned.
I agree with the problem with the crotch of the Levi's I have jeans that are a year old they're like new but they've already got holes in the crotch I'm going to try having a patched before I wear them at all and see if that'll help but the quality definitely is going down the drain are they no longer making these in the US?
Basket soooo cheap didn't make it to halloween
"ORDERED SZ. 11 WAS SENT SZ. 10.
Boots are well made (for the price) Heel of boots are very wide.
Only wish that they Were what was ordered"
Runs large and bulky. Not that cute in person.
"These are extremely warm and comfortable (although they take forever to dry once wet, which is to be expected considering the density of the wool). Unfortunately, the construction is subpar, in my view. On mine, there is one stitch holding the upper to the sole. On my right foot slipper this thread broke, causing the slipper to fall apart. This after 5 months of pretty gentle usage. For the price I expected better."
It doesn't explain there is an opening in the front!!!
"I would stay away from this brand and these sweatpants.  My husband only had this pair for a month and the stitching was already coming undone.  I purchased two of these at the same time one in a different color and that one did the same thing. I returned that one because it was less than a month that he had these pants.  Very disappointed, because these are light and comfortable, but then this issue of the stitching coming undone was unacceptable. I would not recommend these you will be hating yourself for buying these."
I have bought this set. The zippers got broken after the first travel in all of them. Simple fact.
These are super cute and I got a size 8 because that's what I normally wear in shoes. but I had a hard time getting my foot in and then they are snug at the toe. The calf fits perfect though. I wish I ordered a size 9 instead because now they are $40 instead of $16. 
wayyyy to small... Don't know what to do with it now...
These pants are very disappointing they're so tiny there for skinny person if you're over a size 8 don't even bother ordering them. They are see-through very annoying and very disappointed
"I have ordered many items from ZAN in the past and have been satisfied with their products, however this item is not up to their usual standards.  The product is poorly made and really not worthy of the ZANheadgear name.  I was them by hand, and the stitching still unravels."
Very bad! Too small... don't buy!!
this ring is no my Zise my zise is 9
I ordered these for my unborn and Im guessing shell have to wait until shes 5 to wear these they're extremely big.
"Waistline runs large, straight leg fit more like boot cut."
"I bought these slacks at about 15 weeks pregnant and didn't bother reading the reviews. I was desperate for work clothes that would fit and be comfortable. First time I wore them the adjustable elastic in the side came unstitched and came free from the pants. It was at that point I looked up reviews and saw many other people had the same issue. I kept the pants anyway because they were comfortable even without the adjustable elastic. But, at 21 weeks pregnant I am finding that once again the other reviews are right. The thick elastic band running along the front of the pants is very uncomfortable as you get further along in pregnancy. It doesnt matter where I place the band on my tummy - it is tight!  All in all, the price was good at the time, but I didn't get more than a months use out of these pants befor they have become useless."
didn't like it it smelled really bad and very cheap material and the zipper kept getting stuck this was a no no.
Not good quality. Very cheap material. Disappointed. Would never buy again!
Where the toe knuckles align is where the wide measurement is apparently given. The actual toe box is probably where the listed size is advertised. Nothing against Nunn Bush but this is why the shoes didn't fit me with wide feet. The toe box is medium wide.
"these sandals are oversized, so ugly I would never wear them. They look nothing like the pic< also beware the footbed is a dark tan especially around the toe area and makes them look old and dirty!!!"
Stopped working with in a few months. SCAM
Too tight in the front by your face. And to cheaply made.
These scrub bottoms did not fit as expected. They didn't have very much stretch to them at all. Would not buy these again.
"RETURNED.  I'm 5'3"", 125 lb, and this was a very bizarre fit.  VERY belled out at the bottom but ok in the shoulders and chest.  Lovely color.  Overall, I did not like it and returned it.  I just couldn't live with how much it belled out on the bottom - looked ridiculous.  I really wanted to like this jacket!"
"They look nice, but too large. They are as hard as a rock. No cushion at all."
"I have the Lodis Audry-Brera Briefcase in black w/ red trim.  I liked it, and had planned to later purchase the briefcase with wheels.  BUT...It appears that this item is some kind of cloth with a very thin coat of leather bonded to it.  I discovered this yesterday when the loop for the strap broke and the bag fell to the ground.  I at first thought the metal piece had simply slipped out, but upon inspection I saw that the loop formed by the strip of ""leather"" had simply torn in two at the stitching. I wouldn't expect that from leather, and closer look showed little threads at the edge of the loop!  I showed it to my fellow engineers, and we all agreed that it was not leather, that these were threads.  This is not what you pay close to $300 for!  I bought mine in the mall, but it was about that price.  This is outrageous!!!!  Just wish I had figured it out sooner so I could have returned it.  I don't like spending my hard earned money on fake junk!"
Itchy and tight- also came slighty damaged- shoe looks like it was cut with a razor to make it- thought of retunring but after being worn a bit they loosened up
Returned. Smaller than expected
"Not polarized and very dark....like, it's hard to make out peoples' faces on sunny days. Really deepens shadows, rather than muting light. But, you get what you pay for."
Fell out easy
"Not Calvin Klein Quality. Not Calvin Klein feel. Not Calvin Klein. They are thin and and feel very cheaply made. They shrunk like Lily Tomlin after huffing cleaning products. They ARE black so thats good. Now, I really don't like leaving bad reviews but these shirts actually made me angry. I guess thats what I get for buying a-shirts instead of donating to a charitable cause."
"Can I return these?  They feel like skinny jeans, not relaxed fit."
"The shape was nothing like an arrowhead - more of a jagged blob. I returned it right away, low quality."
"Fit is very boxy and unflattering. Sleeves not long enough but extremely wide. Returned. Two stars for delivery, color being very pretty, and ample pockets."
This looked like a jean skirt I owned a very long time ago.  I was hoping to wear it with boots.  I was disappointed that this was so heavy and long.  It also ran fairly large.  I can't complain that it was not well made but I felt like I was wearing a denim tent.
Been wearing them in the construction/industrial setting for four days- 12 hour days. The material used for the insides of the boot rubs the side of my ankles and my heels raw. I have to use gauze along with long soccer socks to avoid irritation to the point of bleeding. Good work boots but could use some improvements on the comfort side.
Terrible poor quality shirt
I mostly buy barefoot shoes and find most set my toes free and are super flexible. These shoes were simply unstructured yet somehow felt limiting. Not comfortable.
I was disappointed in the quality of these. And the pandas are kind of scary for a child.
These are not real 501's! They are thin and the tag on the back looks very wrinkled. The tag looks as if it was washed and the corners are curled up. Returning both fake pair
"Sent back...just as expensive as Hanky Panky and not nearly the quality.  Understand when I say ""quality"" I am using the term VERY loosely--neither Commando or Hanky Panky are that great for $22 pair of undies however, I kept the HP and these little guys were packed up 10seconds after opening and sent back to there little undie homeland!"
"I went up half a size (6.5 instead of my usual 6) based on the reviews, but these sandals still fit all wrong - the length of the sandal from heel to toe is too short, the width around the front of the sandal is too narrow, the center strap in gold is too loose (even when the sandal is buckled tight, on the very last hole), and has absolutely no arch support. I have narrow feet, and they still couldn't be contained in these sandals."
This product was decent... the picture looked much better though and was difficult to put it on at first
Not as comfortable as I was expecting. So far I have not ever had a nice experience with Clarks products.
These shoes are cheaply made. I had bought them for my dad and they did not last but about 5 months. The sole of the shoes came apart with only light use. I used to be a fan of New Balance but not after this.
"I like these shoes except for one thing...I get a red spot / blister on the top of my feet when I wear them.  If I wear them long enough it will result in a blister.  The shoe is not overly tight, and I can't find anything on the inside of the shoe to cause this.  I have two pairs of them and this happens with both.  Have never had this happen with any other shoes.  Too bad...because except for that I love these shoes...they are fabulous to wear in the summer."
"too small, it squeezed my feet on the sides. I'm not normally bigger than a 7.5, especially in slip-on shoes, but I will have to return it for either a larger size or a refund."
Shoe seems to run small so go a size up. Also the bottom plastic started to wear off after two games.
"These pj pants are kind of thin and stiff(ish).  Reminds me of a low quality pair of scrubs. The price was great when I bought them, so yeah, I got what I paid for.  The color and print matched the pic.  No one in my house really wants to wear them though (unless there's no other option).  I would not order again."
"I didn't expect much for the price, but I did expect the necklace to be functional. Unfortunately, the clasp was bent on arrival. Poor craftsmanship. I would recommend spending a bit more for a quality product."
so small!!
Way too small order a size or two up.
I wouldn't buy twice the patterns wear off with washing
Not a great buy. Very thin and small. I don't feel it was worth the money at all. It did however arrive early by a week.
The color is more pink than reflected here and they are incredibly uncomfortable. I sent them back.
The fur sheds on this.  Is this cat hair?
Too large for a large run extra large and the quality was not what I was expected.have to turn it back
"Too big, and i don't like gold either. Thought it was silver. Brought back to ups today, hope to get my refund soon."
"I typically wear a 12M, but have gained weight recently and ordered this shoe in a 13, thinking I would be safe.  This shoe did not even feel like a 12!  Very disappointed because it is truly a beautiful shoe."
Quality was alright in the fabric and the colors were nice but they were absolutely huge.  I don't know where they come up with the fit models.
Way too small.  Bought a 24 month and would not fit a 12 month.
not the right sz  but cute cant wear it though
"The sunglasses came on time and looked fine.  However,  they did not block out any of the sun's rays. It was like being outside without sunglasses .  These are being returned for a refund."
"I read the reviews and thought, they can't be that bad. Well I should have listened. The fabric is nice, however the zippers get caught and you have to back track a lot, and the pull bars don't come out on all of them. this company sent the product with no invoice and no return label. These suit cases are only used for overnight trips now and will never see the inside of an airplane. I will never buy form this company again."
"There was nothing dress-like about this too tight, poorly made, super-thin and raggedy t-shirt. I cut it up to use as a rag.

I gave it two stars only because the seller gave me a full refund on it without having to return it."
"Item does not clasp at all, completely defective. I would not recommend this item. Both earrings defective upon arrival. No"
"The color is nothing like the pic, they are more like dark pink"
"clip was not of the quality as expected, but for the price it was a good deal. just not as good in the quality department i returned it"
returned these for a refund
Cap is extremely small. I got a headache instantly when trying to wear it. I gave the hat to a friend with a smaller head.
Almost impossible to get on and off.
"If you are looking for a lift, this is not the bra to buy! It is so tight around, its as if it sucking your breath out. I am fit tested and bought my correct size. I am unable to wear it so i will have to give it away."
"The inseam was way too long and I returned them,"
"It doesn't  look  like  the  picture, it came  lumpy. I had to  do a lot of adjustments  to  it. I'm only  5'5 so this was pretty  big on me"
Pretty but a stone fell out immediately.
"I will wear them for cleaning house and that is it.  Not enough stretch to keep their shape and they give me 'baggy diaper butt'. I am 5'8"" and size 16"
"This costume didn't even make it through the evening.  The quality is absolute crap.  It might work for trick-or-treating or something like that for a short while, but it didn't survive the few hours we were at a church get-together.  I'll give it two stars just because it really is as cute as the picture."
Two stars because the silver band was thin and slightly bent out of shape. The stone was really nice though. Returned it.
"I got it but it didn't work. its Pretty, but broken."
"While well made these boots did not work for me. I ordered the 8.5. I have another pair of boots by Sorel that I love, however these did not fit. The boots were much too narrow for my feet (slightly wide). I returned the boots without a problem."
Size large is actually a boys size 7. Quality sweater but watch too small.
"Kinda disappointed in Levi's, I ordered a pair of 505's and got a pair with 513 printed on the brown Levi's patch that is sewn at the waist. The paper labels that you remove were marked 505. They are nice, just not the style I wanted."
"I always wear an 8, these didn't fit, were uncomfortable and returned them for a refund."
"the fit was on my feet, perhaps because I have a wide foot. I returned them and got a different clarks style .The unstructured women's un.loop did feel really much more cushion than the ones I ended up getting."
Not comfortable!
"Ordered an xl and normally wear a large. Gave it to my niece who wears an xs/ s, fits her well"
The most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. Arch is so high it hurts. Shoes are very stiff. Bought for standing on my feet for 6-8 hours could barely make it through an hour before I had to change them tried again and they are just too uncomfortable. Disappointed.
It Tore up the First Day!!
these seem to fit small
"Cheap material and the arch runs so low I can't put my foot in the boot. I'm usually a 6 so I ordered a 6 and I held it up to the bottom of my foot and the length of the actual fabric part of the boot seemed perfect, maybe even a 1/4 room,  but the arch was so stingy on fabric and so tight there was no way I could get my foot in them. They're getting returned."
The fit is true to size but it is gaudy. There is nothing believable about this and it is not comfortable to wear. It looks like a ring out of a toy machine.
one of the wires popped out the side and it stabs me Its pretty but it hurts me.
I want to send them back.
"Collar was choking me. Not a ""relaxed"" fit or a high quality one for that matter"
Horrible. They hang off your earlobes not because they are heavy but because the setting is HUGE and makes you look like a clown.
"This wig is horrible. It's very thin, and the ""part"" is a mess! It's zig zaggy and no order to it to even fix it. I also bought the ""Kamo 26 light gold hair"" synthetic wig, which I prefer. The photo I attached is of the yopo wig, since no one is posting photos of the ""part"". I even tried to twist my own hair into the bangs. Yeah no. This wig sucks."
Part of the shoe on the sole came loose after only 2 to 3 weeks of trail running.  I like New Balance shoes because of the fit but this pair was defective.  I would stay away from this Goretex model because this has never happened to a pair of New Balance running shoes I've used for the last 10 years.
Dont waste your Money its is shabby and looks horrable
This was not a plus size I ended up giving it to my 13 year old daughter to wear
Was supposed to gey wide calf and got regular....
"Update to my review. Ordered a few of these shirts. Worn once, washed. Little holes all over in one. Now, I noticed another with these holes. Cute on, but very cheap, thin material!"
"One of the earrings is not seated properly into the metal setting, making an unsightly raw edge and the earring unwearable.  Unfortunate, because the rest of the pieces are placed well. Had planned to wear the necklace with a particular outfit- No time to return, and not an option to contact seller to give them the opportunity to make the earrings right."
Very cheap. Immediately returned it after it arrived.
Great except too tight on my son's toes so he can't wear them (and his foot isn't wide).  Wish they would fit!
Good fit. The material in not very soft.
"Not sure how OU GRID is defining plus size. No way was this dress the right size. The material felt cheap. Do yourself a favor. Don't order from them. It comes from China, so shipping it back costs as much as the garment."
"It is the look we were going for, but am disappointed with the quality. Made of some sort of foam. Brim is rippled and I can't get the ripple out. The hat doesn't fit any head larger than 22"". The white ribbon band is not as robust as the picture shows."
"I can't even give a star cause is TOO ugly. I usually wear M and I buy L, it doesn't fix on me, too small. The material is soooooo cheap and ugly, worst than a plastic bag. I'm so disappointed, I was waiting too much just for nothing."
"this dress is nice but it is for someone flat chested, anything above a B cup and you are exposed"
"Bad fit, stiff plastic, a complete waste of money. If you're going for a fake look, this is it. If you're looking to create a believable comb over, you'd be better off buying a bald cap, theater hair, spirit gum, and creating it from scratch."
Fit was perfect but the dye bled.
Good arch support but too much space in the toe area
They were too small and the quality were really not that great in my opinion.  I had to return them for refund.
The fit of these glasses are not the correct size and t company only take them back on your expense not theirs do not buy them
"Looks nothing like picture, very ugly on."
"I ordered 6 pairs of shoes. 1 ann klein, 4, nine west and these dolce vita.  These were the one's i wanted most!!!  The top strap is deceiving. You cannot open the top buckle, for looks only. There is a zipper on the back to open but I couldn't even get my toes past the top strap!!!  I wear a size 6 to 6 1/2 so i wouldn't think would have that problem at the top of the shoe.  Nicely made but have to go back!!"
"This shirt runs small, my husand normally wears a 2x but would need a 3 x in order to be able to button this shirt."
"They fit my daughter who is a size 1. Very frustrating, I've been a size 7 for years just glad I could put them to use, handing them off to my daughter who's the size of a 9 year old ugh"
Husband complains they hurt his feet
"There are two types of loafer in my experience: the cute schoolgirl style, and the witch. I always aspire for the cute throwback preppy-but-comfy look. These shoes are NOT that. Instead, they have a narrow toe box and a sole/heel that are narrow as well (thus achieving the dreaded ""witch"" or perhaps ""nun"" look). I was interested to try this brand, because I've assumed it's top quality, but it's not worth wearing these because the overall style isn't fun."
I tried ordering two sizes up from my street shoe size and they were still way too small. I'm not sure they would be very comfortable even if I could get the right size.
"This is an awful shirt.  It looks nothing like the image.  It's ""A"" shaped for fattys, itchy, and it hangs too low.  I literally opened the package, looked at it, put it on, took it off, and threw it away."
"I ordered these on the strength of the one existing review.  I would describe them as ""flimsy"", ""spindly"", or ""barely there"".  In all fairness, however, I probably got what I paid for.  I could have returned them, but it wasn't worth yet more postage. (The vendor charged $5.95 to ship them.)  I'll wear them for gardening.  Trust me, the sun refracting from the miniscule stones in these earrings is not going to blind the neighbors."
"Color and style are pretty but after one wearing way too wrinkly and I DO NOT iron  :  )  Even with fabric softener, all fluff and dust and threads cling to it. I ended up throwing it away, can you image?  Just not even worth giving to the shelter."
This purchase was a gift for a male family member. I tried them on and I was not able to pull the gloves on to my forearms. And I have average sized for arms. This was supposed to be  sized for adults.
"Pocket is cheap, see through material and the shipping took entirely too long."
"I don't like the curve of the post, I can't seem to position the earring in a way to get it into my ear. Therefore, I can't wear them."
I ordered the hipster but it was bikini. Package showed hipster.  Won't order again
Had to return. Not at all like the original water bra..
"hugged too much, couldn't wear it."
"The shoes and service are great. There was nil stock of the size 40 I wanted so I took a chance and purchased the next size up. Unfortunately after trying several different inserts I have been unable to find something suitable that enables me to wear them comfortably. They slip up and down and I already have one blister on a toe.

My husband is now on his second pair of Sebago boat shoes and is very happy with them.

  With regards,

  Beryl Allart"
"Gave two stars because I liked the way they looked, but could not even get my feet in them, and back they went."
"I had this on my Wish List for Christmas (brown one).  My hubby got it for me.  I was so excited!  At first, I was in love with this bag and immediately ""moved"" purses from my old one to this one.  On my very first trip out of the house I noticed a little tiny pinhead sized hole in the fabric.  I was a little upset, but figured it was bound to happen with the type of material (not a very sturdy material considering, as we all know, purses take a beating).  About 10 minutes later my daughter exclaimed ""Mom, what happened to your purse!"".  I looked down and saw that the fabric and the grommet had not been properly connected.  Big gaping hole that you could easily see the lining through.  :(  I went home and immediately changed out of this purse and back to my old purse.  We ended up sending my purse back.  I found a similar (much better quality) one locally for the same price as this one."
Good looking glasses but the screws are too small and fall off easily. They are not put together very well.
Toebox is way narrower than the usual sneaker. They fit me well otherwise but I don't like a sneaker that squishes my toes. My foot is wide-ish but not really wide. Usually sneakers are roomy for me.
"The fit is absolutely uncomfortable.  I normally wear 9.5-10 and ordered size 10.  I could barely put my foot through, but once I put it through, the boots were impossible to wear without pain.  Do not waste your money on this."
"VERY SMALL, CAN ONLY HOLD 3 CREDIT CARDS, AND MAGNETIC STRIP IS WEAK."
Cheaply made. Terrible
Creeps up. Instant wedgie. :(
Had to return this bag. It was cheaply made and when I got it in the mail there were pieces glued wrong and the zipper was not straight.
"The Boa in the picture is nothing like the one I received. There is nothing ""deluxe"" about this Boa. I ordered it for a costume, along with a yellow one as well. They came, and as I opened the package, there were feathers coming out. They were THIN and string-y, nothing thick like you would image after viewing the image for this item. Not worth the money, very poor quality."
very light material very revealing
"These are pretty poor quality glasses. I have no qualms about the lens, however the integrity of the frame is another story. 2 months into use they fell completely apart. Mind you I use them for about an hour a day as I'm driving so there was very little wear and tear. If you're looking for something to hold you over until you've saved enough for a good pair of sunglasses, these may be OK."
Beautiful but Shoes too wide Kinda deformed
"All shemaghs are not the same. My mistake was thinking they were. This is the 4th shemagh that I have purchased (not from this company) and it was a disappointment. The color wasn't quite as described more of a gold than orange, material is thin and will very easily snag and I don't see it holding upto any kind of prolonged use."
"I was very disappointed in this dress, it fit awkward - I think it is just the design on the top, I returned it."
"Maybe I got a bad batch, but these fit me terribly.  Too tight at the waistband, and too loose at the crotch so I'm not getting much support."
"These felt a bit big.  Not sure I'd say a full half size, though.  They did feel like wide width, though.  I definitely do not have narrow feet and I felt like my feet would slip out of these easily once broken in.  Last, they looked very frumpy on my foot.  The style was not quite right."
The underwire piece poked through the fabric before I even wore it. Bummer since I brought it on vacation with me and its unwearable :-(
Color was great---but the cap itself was huge.  It fit my son's head---not a fit for women.
"EDIT: originally gave these boots 5 starts. unfortunately the zipper on one broke after less than 3 months (and I didn't wear them every day), and the seam in the back split.

It's so hard to tell the quality of things online sometimes, I am especially hesitant of buying boots, but these are fantastic. The leather feels great, the zipper is high quality, the size is right and they are quite comfortable, even the sole is nice - it's hard to find boots that actually have some tread on them (this was really hard to find in boots with this style), and I'm hoping that means I will still be able to wear them, even once it starts to get icy!"
Too tight.. baby's feet started to turn blue because of fit.. baby was 3 mo old with normal size feet..no reason for them to be so tight..
"This would have been a lovely, if a little small, watch purchase if it worked according to the User Manual posted on the Timex web site.  According to the manual, to set the date, pull the stem to the mid-point and turn either clockwise or counter clockwise to set the appropriate date.  You will need to do this in each month with less than 31 days.  Turning the stem clockwise does indeed advance the date.  But turning the stem counter clockwise does not change the date no matter how many times you reverse past midnight.

I received my watch on January 29th.  The date the watch came with was ""4.""  To have to advance the day from 4 to 29 would have been cumbersome.

I sent my watch back for a refund."
"Fit was good, they were comfortable and cool, until I started walking, the legs rolled up before I took 100 steps, all the way into my crotch and then started rubbing, sad, will not purchase again."
"These weren't prime because they are sold through the Under Armour store.  I didn't think that would be a big deal but it turned out to be.  The shoes ran a little small compared to other brands my son is wearing right now.  He's in a size 6 in Nike cleats and Van's so that's what we ordered.  These shoes barely fit.  He'll outgrow them in a couple of months.  So I thought I'd just order a half size larger and return these.  The return shipping isn't free.  And it isn't even reasonable.  To ship these shoes back, it's going to cost $10.  So we're going to pay $10 for nothing.  I'm a little disappointed.  We buy everything on Amazon - even our kitchen sink.  I'm used to free returns because most of the stuff I buy is shipped by Amazon.  So while these shoes are probably fine, if you order from the UA store, you may want to try a pair on in a local store.  It'll cost less than returning them for another size."
I ordered 6W but it was too narrow to me so I exchanged it to be 6WW (I didn't buy them from Amazon) last year.  It was OK to me but few times later it came with noise from each single step.  It embarrassed me in the office so I decided not to wear them any more since last summer.
"After receiving the clothes, I found the dress was really too thin, and there was no description of it in the introduction of the web page. I was very dissatisfied."
"The first set I ordered had a small sewing defect on the collar so I returned it and ordered a new set. The second set had a huge hole in the seam on the outer thigh.
Disappointing because I really liked the fit and length, but I really don't want to order another set and risk getting another defective item. Its not worth the trouble."
To small ;(
Too small.  Can't wear them.  Donated.
The width is fine but the length is too short. I wear a 9 easily and these were supposed to fit up to 9 1/2. Friends raved about these so I was expecting them to be great. Not so much.
"Xl? More like xxxx small. My xl fit my sister, who wears a 5, snug. Are these child sizes? Not to mention, they are SO thin, and sheer, they would only be good as a bathing suit coverup. Wasye of money!"
"The stones where ok, but the braceket fits too big on the rist, would need a jewelry maker to make it smaller."
"nice looking, but not for me."
"I loved how the dress looks as pictured. However was quite disappointed when i received my package. First off, super fast shipping! But when I took out of package I realized the black was a shiny black fabric not what I had in mind. But alright I can work with that so I tried on...Did not fit me as expected and did not fit as pictured. Its a long dress but as it got past my knees I noticed it flare out. Not what I wanted. Then the back didn't fit me at all it was very loose fitting and just did not look at all like the picture. So I decided to return it and they quickly accepted and returned my money. Overall great customer service dress just wasn't as expected."
"Very cute top, but it is short.  I wish it was longer as pictured.  You are able to see about 1 inch of my skin on each side.  I love the color, but would not order again."
"If your XL then XL will never fit, Too small."
The glass got terribly scratched and blurry in two months. The leather band got so dirty and wrinkly in a few months. I was so ashamed to wear it anymore that I had to buy another watch. I liked the design but unfortunately it is very low quality. I wish it lasted more than one year.
"Nice size. Don't know how durable yet since I just got it. However, I have to give it a low rating because it did not come with the long strap that is shown in the photo."
"I had a great pair of silicone breast covers, and they eventually wore out, weren't sticky any more.  So I replaced them w/these, because the value was great!  Well, these are much smaller than the ones I loved.  They only cover the nipple, not most of the breast.  So I think they give you a strange little bulge over the nipple area, and are almost visible.  My advice is splurge for the more expensive, larger pairs.  They are much more natural looking."
Its WAY too thin. You can see the net cap right threw !! I should have listened to the other reviews.
"It's more like sleep wear, very thin and see thru. It was returned"
"I bought 12 pair of these diabetic socks recently. They turned out to be extremely cheap and made of some material that feels scratchy and stiff. Very unpleasant to wear. I washed them all, hoping they would soften up, but if anything they became worse. Since I've washed them already, I assume I can't return them. I'm going to put them all in the Goodwill bag, I guess, but I'm not happy about having spent $20 on these."
"VERY poorly made and double the price.  Typical Disney.  However, my boy loved them, til they fell apart"
"For some reason, most of the water evaporates, leaving only a small fraction of the intended shaped ice. Waste of money."
"The shoes look great, the color change option in the lighs is great. The bad part is the quality. My 4 year old used them for less than 3 months and the shoes already have huge holes in the front. So if you have active boys, look for other model, with reinforced front part."
"Too hard to get on, I sent it back."
"Unfortunately, the insides of this wallet are already splitting. :("
"so its very pretty, but when it arrived, it smelled SO strongly of BO, and like, a  mans BO soooo ??? I asked 3 co workers to verify that they smelled what I smelled on the shirt, and we all smelled it. im sure it will be fine after a washing, but this affected my review. if not for the smell, I would've gave this 5 stars.
* altering down to one star. finally got rid of the smell by washing it on gentle three times w good soaps- however, even on gentle, it fell apart. ive had to sew it on two seem lines and now gave up as the bottom is totally shredded- the material is hard to fix when it starts to tear. this shirt didn't last, so one star it is. (the other pattern I bought first, lasted just fine and didn't smell)"
Nice jacket but size ran very small.
"WAY TOO SMALL, SIZING IS WAY OFF. NOT WORTH SENDING BACK. I WILL GIVE TO A FRIEND, OR CONSIGNMENT OR SOMETHING. VERY DISAPPOINTED. WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO WEARING IT."
"I wear a 10 and ordered at 10 for a party.  My feet felt like they were breakng,  these run very small and were so painful I threw them away"
"Too wide a width throughout length of shoe, yet tight across toes. Very poorly designed with an uncomfortable fit, gave me blisters (which I haven't had in years). Too expensive for the poor quality product received."
We ordered dark olive and the hat is BROWN!!  It's not what we ordered and it seems I can't return it. I am bummed. Waste of money.  We like the hat in general--we've purchased others and they are cute.  But this one in brown is ugly.
I returned this item because it does not fit as shown.  It does not go off the shoulder.
These gloves are advertised as having a sherpa lining when in reality they have a sheep's trim at the cuff. There is no lining in them. They are no warmer than any cheap pair of knit gloves. I have to say they are attractive and the magic touch works nice.
"So I'm 30 weeks pregnant, 5'8"", and used to wear 6/8 before my pregnancy and I've gained 8lbs more than I should so far (shame on me). I bought medium capris, and they ran big. But ok. The material is VERY cheap. I'd wear it at home, as they're pretty comfortable, but for sure would not wear it outside (honestly I'm even afraid you can see through the pants). I should also mention they don't go too much over the waist, so I don't really think I'd consider them as maternity pants."
Once I buy the right size I'll leave a better rating.
lights stopped working after few days :(
"Rolled down immediately after I put it on.... Tummy control wasn't great.... The $13 one I bought, also on Amazon, worked much better than this one!!"
"The sweater arrived with a stain on the shoulder which did not come out with hand washing.  Very disappointing.  Because my granddaughters need this sweater for a wedding, I ordered another one.  I sure hope it comes in pristine condition."
I sent it back. Don't like the feel of it at all.  Under Armour is a lot better.
Most uncomfortable slippers I have ever bought. The elastic on both sides of the slipper is ragged and caused a lot of pain and irritation  to the side of my feet. to much trouble to return.
Awful!!!! It comes with a wire that makes it not useable on babies!!! I'm so mad!!!
"Loved the look & fit of these boots; however, after just stating to wear them in the fall weather, I just realized the left boot consistently sqweaks when you walk. Tried adjusting the buckles in either direction to eliminate the 'sqweak' with no luck. Unfortunately for me I guess - I am overdue on the exchange policy of 30 days. So disappointed!"
"While this bra does minimize my breastbone considerably, it is uncomfortable. The cups have too much material at the top which creates wrinkling and puckering. I tried a blouse on to see if it were obvious and it definitely is."
I did not like these. They appeared cheaply made and did not fit my face. Actually a bit smaller than in the pictures. I wouldn't recommend.
"The images on the front of these underwear are the cheap plasticky ones, and the elastic is uncomfortable and leaves red marks. I wouldn't buy these again."
The top of the shoe is too small and doesn't hold my foot in.  I walk out of these shoes with every step.  Also the sole of the shoe is for very narrow feet.  I have average width feet and my foot hangs over the sole which feels really funny and doesn't help with the overall walking out of the shoe feeling..
"It was a little small for my daughter. Plus, they were itchy when she and I tried them on, it was unbelievable! Anyway, hope this helps you make up your mind. Also, I rated it 2 stars because it looks cool."
Way too small for my girlfriend in both the calf and foot.
"Is 2 sizes smaller than tag says. Pretty, but unable to use. Will be returning."
Small size as ordered  but it came with very long sleeves and hence very expensive have it tailored to the desired sleeve length.
the links are too big... looks awkward with a small links and better jewelry.  this is aimed for maybe younger girls...
"First of all for a medium these are very loose around the waist. You might want to go down a size. The material is mediocre, but what you would expect from cheap boxers. My main problem is the color. I received 4 of the same one, which happens to be the ugliest color."
"Skirt is too stiff, too thick, too hot. The skirt portion feels like thick flannel material that has been starched and ironed."
"Pants have no lycra in them, ladies.  And the top is too short.  Do not recommend this, in my opinion.  Also, the color combo is way too dated.  It's 2016.  This color scheme is more like 1986.  Just one gal's opinion.  I returned them."
"These are a comfy pair of capris....but for exercising they feel very baggy and loose, more like pajamas than exercise gear.  They run at least one size too big, and the cotton is extremely thin.  I thought Danskin was a better brand, but maybe the design is intentional.  Instead, I'm going to use these around the house for cleaning days and bought yoga pants from TJMaxx that are much better for aerobics.  Incidentally, I bought a Danskin yoga mat and it was also disappointing...not well made and actually flawed in places."
"The most unbelievable packaging I have ever seen....its like they were worn and put back in plain packaging with no info what so ever on it.
Returned and went name brand."
"Material is cheap feeling, but I have yet to give them the wear test outside.  I don't know how they will hold us. material is definitely not rubber or even rubber like. It is dry and very light............it might be good."
"The leather was medium grade. Might as well be a 9West shoe. It was comfortable but it looks a lot better online than in person. Reminded me of a shoe for my grandmother, not something I can wear in my office. BEWARE, the seller charges a restocking (mileage fee of 5% due to gas prices), guess they don't know gas prices have gone done! You can ship back for 'free"" using their return label and they will later deduct that fee from your return...hence...NOT FREE!.

I'll stick with Zappos!!"
Way to small. I usually very between a large and a medium depending on the shirt. This one my 15 year old daughter couldn't fit.
"I have slender legs and ankles but had a heck of a time shoving my foot into this boot because it is so rigidly shaped that it won't flex for anything. As soon as I got myself into the boot, it was too large (again, small legs) so not sure who it would work for? Returning ASAP."
I ordered a size up and it is still small.
"These were the most comfortable shoes I have ever had on my feet.  However, after 2 weeks of just walking (not even running) the webbing over the toes gave way.  I went through the process of getting a return authorization (within their 30 day return policy), paying for shipping and returning.  I never received acknowledgement from Dress Code Clothing that they had received the return.  USPS tracking did inform me that the shoes had arrived on 10/10 (5 days ago).  I requested an exchange of the defective shoes.  I had not heard anything from the company and called a non-toll free number today and was told that they had received the shoes but they would not replace them because they had been ""worn""! I asked then why I hadn't been notified of this and why hadn't my shoes been sent back. The ""service person"" said I should have been notified.  I was told that ""now"" we will send the original shoes back.  I was also told that there was no supervisor to speak with.  I have never had bad service from Amazon or one of their partners, but this experience is very disheartening.  I certainly will never buy shoes from Amazon again.  Zappos!, here I come!"
"Had to return, too boxy"
These gloves are cheap looking! The picture is very misleading to the product. As a cosplayer I could not use these.
"Hi this product is not so good,to my left foot is ok,and my right foot one nr is big! How I used? I looking like a duck in the boat! :-( first time buy something what is not good! I'm so sad! :-("
"I really wanted to like these and in many ways I did but after only a few five mile hikes I've been struck by severe pain behind my second toe - an area that has NEVER been prone to issues in any of many previous shoes I've worn.  I've tried inserts with metatarsal arches but no dice, these still inflame that part of my foot.  Anyway - zero support.  Not good.

Good things about these shoes - a BIG toe box.  I do not understand why other shoe companies do not get on this bandwagon.  I have narrow heals and wide toes.  This causes constant issues with fit in most shoes but I talk with other women and many complain of the same thing.  Hello shoe companies??  (I wonder how these will work coming down steep slopes but will likely never find out now.  Do your feet slide forward too much??)"
I like the idea of the necklace. The DNA part of the necklace is nice but the chain is very short (nearly a choker) and the chain looks and feels very cheap.
"Had to return almost immediately.  Just not a good shoe for my foot shape, felt like the shoes had a bulge along the outside edge of the footbed."
I bought a size larger thinking they were so cheap because of irregularities.  Still small and haven't gained an ounce.
I loved the sparkles...however the length of the boot is a little to long for my taste.  I did return these boots.  :(  Still trying to find the perfect pair
"Junk, broke before wearing it once."
I bought these for their style and the belief that fryes still made their products in the US. When The box arrived and I put them on I was wrong on both counts. Very stiff leather which made them Uncomfortable and looked cheap. For the money I can buy a pair of Italian made shoes that are soft stylish and better made.
"Loved the way this shoe looked, and the price was right too. But unlike another pair of Pumas that were lightweight and nearly barefoot construction, I found these to be uncomfortable-- with a seam right across little toe area--and stiff. Wish I had not worn my old Pumas so much that the style number disappeared. But not these puppies: they got sent back the same day they arrived!"
sent back .  too tight
"I was expecting Wells Lamont to offer a high quality glove.  But these are not sewn together well, specifically the Thinsulate liner is not sewn to the wool glove well at all."
"This bag is fairly nice, but no one will ever mistake it for LV. Not that I was ordering it for that reason, but the hardware was visably cheap.  I returned it."
"This is trash, poor quality, the paint is peeling!!!! I need my money back!!!!"
Shirt very stiff and scratchy.  Not even remotely soft.  Not even the kind that will soften with washing.  Find this one somewhere else.
Very narrow and tight. Quality is low to medium.
"I guess it's not what I've expected and not worth the cost, it may be just me."
"Child size, no free bag in packaging, not dark. Quality control issues, coating was peeling upon arrival."
"I have never had a fat foot, but these shoes are very narrow....."
"very poor support, no cushioning, too tight regarding the left shoe..........something was jabbing the top of my foot.  for the price,  they were not well made in my opinion. sent them back..........other ARA shoes have always fit and were very comfortable to wear, but not these."
They arrived on time and in perfect condition. They are very cute. These glasses start out nice and then the lens falls out after two or three wears. On second  pair and both pairs the lens fell out.
These fit my father too small.  We needed to return them.
I ordered this shirt because it was supposed to be fitted and it was still baggy. Not the fit I was expecting.
"Way too small and cheap looking for the price paid. Save your money, a quart ziplock holds more."
"Fit well and looks good, but quality of zipper is not good, it tends to separate below the zipper if you aren't extremely careful when you first start zipping it engaging the two bottom lugs. And, If it separates below the zipper it's really difficult to get it unzipped again."
Fits as expected I just didn't like it and they way the front ripples in the pic is false there is no ripple hang down in real life just tringle tip fabric
"Ships from China, so be prepared for long wait, even tho item description states Fulfilled by Amazon.  First time I'll say, ""you get what you pay for"".  Fits small, I sized up to a large, and it fits like a medium."
"They were very cute, and  LOOKED comfy, but lacked arch support, I didn't feel comfortable at all."
"I'm 5'7 and ordered xl for length...they said 40"" log, they were 30"" and too short for my legs, i'm  disappointed..they were nice..."
Will be sending back.
I order the right size but it's too big
"Broke when I was trying to put it on. Also it seemed too small for my ear, and my ears are NOT large. Waste of time/money."
The fit is okay but the material is thinner than I thought it would be so there is a noticeable line where the bra cuts into my breast. It's not a very attractive look at all.
I have ordered twelve watches from Amazon. This is the only one that didn't work
"It's always confusing buying pants for my husband who is a 38-40 W and 36 L. Especially when a 36 L doesn't always fit the same way. I bought him a pair the other day that fit perfectly, then I bought these and they're too long, and at the same time too tight in the crotch area. It's just frustrating. They seem to be quality material but I'll have to send them back. No salvaging this pair."
Fit small and won't work for me.
"Loved this when I got it...it fit just like pictured. HOWEVER, after I washed and dried it, it was skin tight and awful. DON""T DRY IT!"
The fit is a little irregular. Very fitted from the chest and very loose from the hips.
looks cheep and childish.  gave it away
You should be aware that you are buying a fashion statement instead of a real piece of clothing. The shirt looks nice at first but quickly degenertes into a mess after a month. Not durable at all.
These did not fit my average sized 2 year old at all
Its a cute skirt for the price. I ordered a 2x based on the reviews. Its a little big and not as form fitting as I would like. I would suggest ordering your true size. (I am a 14/16 btw)
"These pants were sent back because they  must be using the dewey decimal system instead of the standard American Inch system for measuring these sizes. I couldn't even get the pants to come up past my waist...way too small even though label said it was what I ordered.
If you plan on getting these then do yourself a favor and order at LEAST 2 SIZES UP than you'd normally wear, otherwise you'll just be following in my footsteps and sending the damn things back..."
"My favorite, most comfortable and best fitting shoes are all New Balance. I bought these to wear with dark dress pants and was very disappointed. Unlike my other New Balance, these are about 1/2 size too short, have very stiff, hard insoles and exert unpleasant pressure on the center of the balls of both my feet. Had to return them. Not recommended."
This one was broken after  1 or 2 months' use.  Totally not worth the money.  Would go to dollar store to buy one.
I normally wear a 10 in sandals. These seemed like a 9 marked as a 10
I was really excited about this suit but the top is too much trouble to get into. I thought that the straps could be removed to be adjusted but they can't so this makes the top hard to get into and out of by yourself. The bottom is OK
Cheap. not worth it.
These didn't work for my 9 month old daughter that is crawling. They only have a weak elastic on 1 end so they are constantly sliding off her legs.
the nose rings fall out very easily because the ball on the end is microscopic. a waste of money
"The material is good but like other trifolds it gets a little too bulky and I don't like the way bills fold. The card slots were also too tight.

I also tried Alpine Swiss bifold but had a smiliar issue. I eventually switched to a card holder wallet (without any moving parts) and it's much better."
Broke in a few days
"The dress does not have any fitting, and not long enough for taller ladies. It probably would work well with petite ladies."
"This wallet is not 100% leather. It says ""coated leather cover"" and ""manmade interior"". I bought it as a replacement for my previous  genuine leather Columbia wallet that I have used for 15 years.  This wallet is a big disappointment. It is very soft, but does not even feel like real leather and is not as well made as my precious wallet. I'll be surprised if it lasts for a year."
I bought this hat for my 4 year old son. It was very cute but he only wore it twice before the stitching came undone on the brim. Not worth the purchase.
Stupid lotus Opal sparkle filigree is going to go missing within 5 minutes of having it in your nose bc of the weight.
Don't waste your time... stone fall out fast.
They are just too small.  Don't know if I can even put them on.  They may turn into a gift for someone with small hands and no arthritis in the thumbs.
Fell off
The chain and pendant broke when I put it on.  Very poor quality.
"they say 3x to 4x, and they are too small, returning."
If. I'll give no stars I would... terrible just terrible no words.
Cup size so small
"Nice material, fits on the snug side, very poor craftsmanship on the zipper. I thought maybe I was being a little picky when the zipper didn't function well (from day one). Less than 2 months after purchase, the zipper broke. I've contacted the seller to see if there's a warranty. I can't afford to pay $48 for a two-month item"
I was disappointed in the fit. The quality is ok... though the buttons do not stay closed.
"I ordered two and neither one fit properly, scoop neck was way too low."
Didn't fit and cheaply made
"I didn't like this scarf because it was way too short to do anything with it! I have to pin the front if I want to wear it, because it's to short to tie or wrap."
"I don't understand why so many companies make maternity/nursing shirts.  You don't nurse while pregnant, unless you have another child, which I do not.  This shirt is way too large post-partum.  I sent it back."
"returned the shoe tried it on, owned the same brand but different style wear an 8,5 bought the 9 it was too big even with socks nice looking shoe I thought 8 would be too small so I didn't reorder"
"I purchased a pair of these 4 years ago and i wore them to death and got many compliments. I was really looking forward to another new pair, however something has changed. This pair began to crack within a week. I was very disappointed that i had to send them back. I really did like them. :("
"Upon opening the carrier, I noticed a big chunk of foam missing. The missing piece was nowhere to be found which is mysterious. If the foam was intact, I'd give the product 4 stars. But mine rates only 2 stars because of the missing chunk and the concern over the foam's durability.

-The exterior canvas material is of extremely good quality - very thick and durable.
-There is velcro on all sides AND a latch to secure the top. No way this top is popping off ever.
-Rugged carry handle at the top that velcros together. Makes for easy carrying.
-The foam is very thick although probably a bit fragile based on my missing chunk.
-The interior capacity is relatively small because so much of it is foam. Good enough for a potluck or bringing home take-out for a family of 4 or 5. Since the foam is totally rigid, your food will either fit or not - no stretching possible."
Cheap and small.  Would love to get my money back.
Nice stretchy material but too short and I'm usually a 16-18.  The G-string is not even close to plus size...don't even bother.
"The color was very orange, returned as soon as I opened the box."
"They're very cheap and after one day of use, one pair already started to fray."
"Okay, I love the fabric and color. It is very soft. However, the length is too short when I went to wear it today! The description says that it is 40 inches. That is a lie. I measured it three times and it is 38 inches! I am very angry. I can't even return it now because I'm two days after the return policy! I do not suggest buying this skirt. I will never buy for this company again!"
toooo laaarrggee
"These shoes were great at the start and very comfortable. However, after wearing them for 5 days, the bottom half came undone. Had to use shoegoo. Never had an issue in such short of time of wearing any other shoes and did not do anything out of the ordinary that would cause the shoe to break. Wondering if I was shipped a knock-off or maybe that was the reason they were on a sale; defective version. Timberland's have served me well in the past but now these have changed my mind."
"Even though the size was mine, the dress was pulling down in the shoulders. Had to return it."
I was most disappointed with packaging of this purchase.  One shoe was the correct size and other shoe was two sizes smaller. I am not sure if this is Amazons fault or the manufacturer.
"FOR THE PRICE, YOU CAN GET BETTER SHOE. AND IT'S NOT SIZE RIGTHT... TOO BIG AND TOO WIDE."
My daughter has mild sensory issues and the shirt is just too itchy.  The leggings are very long.  We will return this one.
Cheap clips in my opinion. Does not stay in hair very well. It falls down easily and I am always having to fix them. Nice colors though.
"The bracelet was as shown, but the rope decoration began to unravel in 2 days"
"I am a large busted woman and was looking for a bra that would fit nicely around my ribs and cups that would fit my ""girls"" well.
I could tell right off that their version of a 42 was not a version of a 42 I have experienced before,  It was pretty tight and that was at the loosest hooks.  The cups fit my breasts oddly, they fit them sort of in a vertical position and not in a round all the way around way.  My breasts were sort of off to the side instead of up and lifted.  I wore the bra for 3 hours and once I took it off I had deep angry red grooves under my arms where the lower band fit, it got tighter and tighter as the night had worn on and I could tell that it would be very tight and uncomfortable.  My size as it has been measured is a 42DDD and that is what I ordered, but this bra just didn't make the grade for my body."
Pinch in the toes and don't conform to my foot shape.
Do not buy! They are toxic- literally. I opened the package and the smell gave me a headache. I immediately put them outside. I am writing to Amazon and hope they will remove these shoes from their site. I was compelled to warn others and wrote this review.
Underwire too thick and very uncomfortable.
"Fits extremely small. Bought these for my mother, in a half size bigger, made no difference, they aren't seemingly made for regular size feet."
Fits well but material feel weird and  looks cheap.
"This custom is horrible. First of all, the the back was not closed and I had to pinned it so that the top part shirt would closed. Second, the fabric is so cheap and makes you itchy, third of all, the pants would run up constantly, the blue banner was too long, and most of all the whole custom was too small for like a three year old, and my son is five. short,  and skinny, and this did not fit him at all."
"Jeans were way too big, very high waist, returned them. I'd order two sizes down thn you usually wear."
"was fine for about a day, very cheap materials, but what do you want for the price. i noticed the buckle was crooked, si i tried to adjust it, then learned it was glued in place because the belt was too thin to be held by the clip. the end piece will fall off in a few uses and the belt will start to unravel. the back of the buckle is sharp enough to cut you (and it will cut you), so your going to want to file some edges down. all in all you will get a few weeks out of her, and those couple of weeks, will not be good weeks."
"These shoes are waaaaay too small.  I am always a size nine and I could barely get these on.  Too narrow, too short, and they smelled horribly of moth balls when they arrived.  The picture is true to the item, they look identical, but the sizing is way off, and the smell is off-putting."
Only downside is they just do not dry out quickly.  If you are in a continually damp environment they start to mildew and stink
Very cheaply made almost see through. Came smelling like perfume with a nice big hole in the arm.
"Very poor quality, since the first wash it lost its colors. Dont waste your money."
Bought this Shoes in March 2014. It was the worst buy ever. After 1 week it looked like something that was dropped in sulphuric acid. The scuffing was a UNBELIEVABLE. The color changed was miraculous. The threadings were everywhere. The shoes just fell apart. I won't buy this product again. It doesn't deserve a single star. The idea of the shoe is okay ie the design shape color...but the material is of the lowest quality ever. Good idea.....Bad execution.  Look but don't touch!!!
My glasses cam but without the sunglass case
"Too small -- but it was cheap, so it would have cost more to send back -- I gave it away."
"What the heck Clarks??  This was so tight on my foot that I couldn't even get it on.  I've always been a true 9, so I was floored when I couldn't even squeeze through the first strap with my toes.  Sent back right away!"
"These seemed like great socks for me around Wisconsin in the colder weather.  I don't like higher than the ankle socks unless I'm wearing boots, which I almost never do unless I'm snowblowing and it's deep enough to warrant them.  So I usually am wearing short socks like this with ankles that get the cold breezes as I snowblow and shovel in my tennis shoes.  Just easier that way to maneuver...

These are padded but not as thin on top as the other pairs I have from other brands, so these seem to help keep my feet warmer in the winter than the other pairs that breathe better.

But when you actually get moving around more, such as cutting grass - man, these were horrible.  I have literally 8 different sets of PowerSox socks here now that  I've been trying out, and these are the ONLY pair that won't stay up.  I couldn't get more than 15 steps behind my push mower before these were balled in the middle of my feet, uncomfortable, half my foot out of them already.  If I tied my shoes so tight that they were uncomfortable, then they stayed better (but still not very much).  But every other pair here I have that they make stayed just fine with these shoes tied at the same tightness.  So clearly these socks just don't stay put like every other pair of ankle socks I have..."
It fit more like size 4 than a size six
"These are very small glasses, the description is for a toddler........not sure what type of toddler would be this small. Definitely for a baby, not toddler."
"I'm not a big fan.  I've always wanted cork sandles, but after a few months of normal wear they turned black.  Very lame.  I don't wear them anymore due to them being black and gross on my feet.  I still keep them around for work sandals but I don't wear them out."
Very short and wide
"Too small for me, i normally wear xs but this is so small for me not satisfied........"
"This watch broke just outside of the return window.  I'd had is a little over two months.  I think it's a gorgeous looking timepiece, but it's not at all resilient.  It can't handle normal day-to-day wear, it seems.  I bought it because I work in an art museum and there's no clocks in the galleries.  I wanted something that would look ""artsy"" with a little sophistication.  This looked right, but its performance is all wrong."
"I am 5' 5"", 275 lbs, and a true full hourglass figure (52"" hip, 41 1/2"" waist, 48 1/2"" bust), size 40DDD. I ordered according to the size chart provided by the seller and the dress that I received was a tent. I pulled it on without unzipping it. The fabric was so large and loose, and the bust/bodice of the dress was so long that it hit about 3"" above my hip bone. I didn't have time to do much more than take it to be altered and hope for the very best. The boning in the bust was so stiff I looked like madonna and I had it removed. The top line of the bust was odd and pointy instead of curved like your typical sweetheart (and like the photo for that matter). I have a fairly sizable bust and didn't come close to filling up the space allotted up top. Lastly, there was so much extra bunched material in the middle!!! I'll let the photo speak for itself, and post a picture of me in this dress is navy blue, and for comparison, a dress I wore a few days after that is not in any way associated with this seller (floral dress). This was a bridesmaid dress for a wedding, so I couldn't just opt to return it/not wear it.
The other ladies were ""average"" size/build and their dresses seemed to fit much more appropriately/proportionately than mine.

I don't think I've ever felt worse in a garment- after the wedding I tossed it in the trash."
"THIN!! beware, this is so thin and not supportive- it was like having cups made of pantyhose!!"
"Just way to large, sending them back, buying another pair of croc's"
There is no point purchasing this product when there are superior licenced products available for a few dollars more. I'm disappointed with myself for purchasing.
I really wanted them to work but they were a little too small and the heels are dangerously unsteady when walking.
"Be wary when ordering these shoes.  I work 12 hour shifts and a few times I have fallen in them.  (and I mean fallen hard).  Crocs to me just don't have good traction soles on them and at 56 years old, I'm not ever buying them again because I do fall as gracefully as I used to.  :-)  To me, Crocs are dangerous but that is just my opinion.  The last time I fell in them, (tile floor and my feet just went out from under me) I threw them all in a dumpster.  I was afraid to give them to Goodwill because I don't want anyone else to call.  I am exclusively wearing Klogs brand now and have never fallen in them.  Just my honest opinion."
I bought XL for my husband who usually wears about a 42 waist. These underwear in XL look about like a small or medium without much stretch.
"Way, way, way too small! I bought in my normal size and my heel was hanging over the back."
I was not shipped the top I ordered. It also didn't fit as well as another Kanu swim tee I ordered which was perfect.
"the lace area isn't made correctly, at least for me.  these, i'm sorry i bought."
The strap broke before I had a chance to wear it...didn't wash it or stretch it.  It just popped off as I was putting it on.  :(
"I don't like anything about it;  too small, material not nice, bad terminations.  Didn't bother to try it on.  Most unattractive."
"Trying to insert these in was painful. They are beautiful, but the area that inserts into the pierced part of your ear is just TOO big."
"So disappointed, do not buy! No support like having nothing on. I completely wasted my money."
"Awkward fit, had to return. Not comfortable."
"looks a bit cheap - and wrinkles like crazy...., sad face"
I thought the brand was better than it was. It is cheap fabric and shrank a whole size the first time and I did not put in dryer. It picks up little balls of cotton... waste of money I think.
"Do not purchase this, it looks nothing like it when you received it. Trust me, don't waste your money."
"Received the item and it was completely broken. The clasp was stuck open and the chain broke off by just touching it. It is absolutely beautiful, but it's so messed up I can't even fix it."
Fit was very tight and length shorter than expected.
Purchased the green one in a size medium. I'd give this P.O.S. swimwear -5 stars if I could!! This is the worst swimsuit I've ever bought on Amazon! It's clearly been tried on or worn previously AND it's MISSING the strings to tie on one of the sides! It looks HUGE for a medium size too smh... Very disappointed with this purchase!!
I bought these for my son and the second time he wore them they were coming apart from the sole.  Not very made well or we got a lemon of a shoe?
Came in a bag (crushed) and reformed with perma cracks. Too small for a 23 inch head (considered a standard Large by the amazon men's hat sizing chart). Good for kids but recommend something else for adults.
"Runs very small, order 2 sizes bigger"
A little short. And shrinks when you wash it.
It broke after wearing it one time. Very cheap material and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. waste of my money and time.
"Do not buy this. It is silver plated. Initially, it looked nice, but I purchased it in May and by July, the silver plating was wearing off the part that slips on the bracelet. It looked horrible. I purchased another ""D"" letter charm that was sterling silver in July. Hopefully it will last more than 2 or 3 months. You get what you pay for."
"I love the design, the fabric and the size but the quality is NOT good. Since I had it it already broke in two different seems and the bigger zipper. I also had to fix the closing magnets to stay in place because they were coming off. Very sad because i really liked it"
"The boot definitely runs small.  I got a 1/2 size bigger.  Anyway, they are not as nice looking as they seem on the picture.  Plus mine were scratched on one side.  I returned them"
The size was wrong it says 38 x 29  butt I'm a hundred percent sure it was 36 by 32.
Broke after one day
"I'm 5'3 and 130 pounds I ordered the medium, should have gotten the large. These are alright, I ordered them for an event and didn't even wear them because of how VIOLENTLY see through they are. Plus them being on the smaller side made any sort of movement/activities absolutely embarrassing."
I love babysoy kimonos and desided to by this bodysuit. And that was a disappointment! item is too large in shoulders for my 2 months old little one. But length is a sort of ok. I have no idea what measurements they used to make it...
"I bought this exact size and type of shoe again so I would have a new running pair (my first was from Fleet Feet).
Please pay attention to reviews that say there is something wrong with these shoes. The fit was absolutely perfect, but I really should have paid attention to reviews because I wore them on several short runs no problem. When I tried a 6 mile run on them they gave me bad leg pain. The cushion or somehow the shoe was made differently  from the previous pair I owned. Same exact shoe. I'm so disappointed that $80 is going down the drain because it has been too long to return."
"This watch is sub-par - you can actually but it at Wal-Mart!  I should have returned it, but instead, I threw it in a junk drawer to remind myself not to buy this brand again,  1.  It IS heavy!  Noticeably heavy.  2. It is extremely hard to unsnap the clasp; if you are lucky enough to get it on, you better have someone to take it off for you.  3.  Compared to my other watches, RADO, Citizen, CORUM, etc. this watch DOES belong in a Wal-Mart jewelry case!!!  Don't waste your money."
"They look cute but I could not even get my foot into the boot to wear. They were way to tight/narrow for me to get my foot into. This has never happened to me in any boot before. Too bad because they looked so cute, wanted to wear them badly! :("
"I hate these pants.  They look nothing like the picture.  They are the most unbecoming pant I've tried in a long time.  I got a size to fit but it was a bit small but the worst is the way it hangs, or doesn't.  I then ordered a size larger thinking that would look better but still, somehow this garment is cut wrong or?  Perhaps the rise isn't long enough but it seems no matter which pair I tried, they didn't hang at all but focused on the crotch area if that makes sense. Perhaps the pattern was wrong in that the waist, even in  a larger size, the way it gathered put an emphasis on the lower area like the waist gatherings pulled in a wrong way as to outline the lower region. Not a good look, not a graceful hanging but a gathering in just the wrong places.  The legs are really bad as well. Rather than any sort of narrowing toward the knee/calf, it is just as big on the bottom as the top - a big, ugly box leg is the effect.  I did not want these even for home where no one could see me.  I cannot in any way recommend these pants. Not even the price is in line with what they are selling."
As of June 2017 - Does not work with Carnival Luggage tags....which is what I purchased it for.  BUT they're very well made and work as plain luggage tags.
the shoe is LONG; from front to back. it's long~. heel is too tiny too. Don't think it will last long.
Very nice hat but fit is too small for my average size head.
material is awful
Boxy/flowy fit
"First off, I wear a size 15. I can't go into stores and try shoes like most people. And the selection at big and tall stores is very limited.
That being said, I have ordered shoes online for years. I have never had a problem. 15M has fit every time.  In all my shoes, and sneakers, I need to pull out the liner and put my custom orthotics in (due to fallen arches). I ordered these in the white with the red lacing. They seemed like they might be leather. They do say ""Leather Upper"" on them but I gotta wonder. Wearing these for the first time with the orthotics was horrible. There is no support to hold my heal in the shoe. My heel pops out with every step.  My foot also feels like it is sliding forward to the front. Wearing without the orthotic is just as bad, compounded by the fact that I am not wearing the orthotics. So I figure they may just run big. So I put back in the liner that came with the shoe, and then the orthotic. The are a little snugger that way, but I still feel like my foot is sliding forward and the heel still wants to pop out with every step.
And I had already thrown out the box they came in, so I can't return them. They just have no support whatsoever. It is like wearing mush on your feet. Maybe I can use them as slippers, only I have a nice pair of slippers that are kind of like moccasins. The feel great and I can't wear them out."
Had to send back as it was impossible to get on!  Looks good online but didn't work for me; Easy return
Two sizes too small. Complete shiayte! Don't order no matter what the price is. Bought a medium for my 150lb brother who wears a U.S. small and it didn't even come close to fitting him.
As pictured and the bridge looks cheap
"Completely see through, looks like a cheap shear  valance. It's a complete waste of money don't waste your time."
"Compared to other shorts I have bought, these ran really small, felt much closer to a medium than a large. Felt so hopeful after reading the other reviews that I risked it even though the shipping is so much, but now I have to lose more money to return them."
"Didn't stick, not true to size although I followwd the advice of other reviews.  Very disappointed, purchased for my wedding day.  Waste of money."
Don't like!
The liner appeared to be too large and caught in the zipper the first time I used it.
Broke one the first use!
Is very tough to get belt locked and paint was coming off the buckle in less than 2 hours.
The black was wore off in less than 24 hours
"They seem to run small. I wear a size 8, but my toes are so smashed in these I'd never be able to walk comfortably. Plus they are made out of a hard plastic type material.. returning them!"
Very small size
"It'd be five but I had to fix the laces to make them look  nicer and I had to cut them to look pretty but other wise are quite charming

Update: while lacing the second shoe I found A METAL NAIL under the frilly stuff at the top. I am terrified to find more"
"This hat looked really cool and had 4.6 stars out of 5, so I thought ""What could go wrong?""
Lots, I got a small, dirty, cheaply made hat that feels like plastic, came in not distressed, didn't have the Kbethos logo inside, and has a cheap buckle on it.
What happened! I trusted your ratings but I got something else entirely different!"
We have had these for 2 day and the side is unglued. My son is very sad. He loved them for the 2 days he wore them.
The shirt did not match the visual description.  It's a total ripoff. The Eddie image is a lot smaller and doesn't have killers on the back.
Nice product but the size was one size smaller than normal.  Had to order a different style that I know was sized correctly.  Wasted $70 in product and shipping.
The item material does not support your bust.
not verry tight around waist
"The boots are uncomfortable to wear. I can't stand walking with it even in a few meters, so I just keep the shoes for display in my closet. Otherwise, it is not functional."
too much compression. thought they would be 8-15 but ended up being 15-20
This particular cut of the Lacoste polo is about one size too small. It also didn't fit too well in a larger size. The chest and arm proportions were not well matched.
"!!!!! BUYER BEWARE !!!!! I purchased an ""Swish Compact Travel Umbrella with Auto Open Close"" in Jan 2016. It was a great product however; after about 50 open and close; the umbrella does not open anymore; when I press the open/close button; it feel like the spring tension is too strong; the umbrella pole just extends;but umbrella rib or the umbrella itself does not open. Swish Direct stated they will give me a free replacement but it has been over 3 business days without any further communication."
Very disappointed because you wouldn't replace it.
Columbia always seems to make the leg opening very close to the waist size and that's true here.
Well i thought geting a pair of bibs for 22 bucks was a steal. was i wrong . Dickies bibs are so much better. The 2 buttons on the left side . Rip the holes wider than they origally were. The dickies bibs material seems stronger .thicker .n more comfy . Definitly will buy dickies next time.
The material is BS. Don't like that feel on me when I wear it. But looks okay if worn on shorts.
"They were too small & wouldn't stay up.  They're pretty, so I tried to lengthen the straps of one by sewing the straps from a 2nd one to the 1st one.  Still didn't work."
"I was looking for a simple pair of white flip flops, and being the croc lover that I am, I went for these. They look neat, and are supposed to be ""close to barefoot.""  These shoes feel AWFUL on your feet and they are impossible to walk in. Very uncomfortable and they don't hug your feet, so they slide around when you try to walk in them."
"although comfortable and mostly wrinkle free, the cuffs rapidly fray long before the pants would wear out.  In just a month or two of normal wear, the cuffs are so frayed that I can't use these in public."
"I wear the same size in a padded bra, not only was it not padded, it was also too small."
"Painful on the feet. I sent these back due to the tight, narrow fit and discomfort."
Dislike ! Not at all what I expected. They arnt even swimming trunks !
"The ""hair"" doesn't lay flat, is cut weirdly, and gives you the distinct look of a 60 year old woman trying for a sassy haircut. It flips out, it's short, not right"
"These run very small in my opinion.  What's odd...I ordered 2 sizes smaller in a the briefs...and there wasn't may difference in size.

These really don't have any stretch to them...and there isn't much gather around the elastic at the waist.  If you do order, take in to consideration that they run very straight from the elastic to the hem..so if it fits your waist, but you have a little more junk in the trunk or are a little hippy...they will be tight and pull in those areas."
Earrings way too big for my taste
"This is one of the worst things that happened to my hair.
I wet my head, towel dried it and applied Olaplex 3 from roots to ends. Waited for 30 minutes, rinsed it off and followed with my shampoo and deep hydrating conditioner.
I let my hair air dry (I usually do that) and ... Before I put this stuff on I had natural waves, my hair was shiny and it did not look like an overused swab. I had some breakage, means my hair also luck protein, but since I'm also coloring my hair I blonde I thought this treatment could be nice.
I witnessed how it changed my friend's hair in best possible way. But this isn't my case. Perhaps because I color with Aveda and Aveda strongly stands against Olaplex being mixed with their product. I know I didn't mix anything, but maybe it has some bad reaction with the color I have...
I just hope it will rinse off...
If you're planning to try it, do yourself a favor and try on a little part first. If it doesn't work for you, you won't end up with full head of disastrous hair like I did."
"The center, or waist, of the suit is sewn so that the material will not stretch to go over your thighs. I could probably pull it on but the threads would snap. For the price I took a chance. Very cute suit & nice fabric but it's unwearable."
"These are cute, cheap, and just ducky if timermall could take the time and trouble to install the battery or include the appropriate tool for you."
"This is a pretty shoe but the toebox was very small. It probably wasn't even 10mins before I needed to take them off due to blisters being rubbed on the tops of my toes.  Beauty is pain, but there a is limit! A larger size may have made some sort of a difference but i'm not really sure."
Very small. Fits a 10 year old. Not for an adult.
"I am so tired of fake amazon reviews!!  This is a cheap cotton visor from the dollar store, there is no shine or bling and the photo is not accurate!!
the price is crazy, you will be disappointed.  I can't believe how often I read glowing reviews and then get phony stuff sent to me."
"This item is not as pictured. It comes very small and will not give you the slouchy look as pictured, which is what I was looking for. Be careful if you want this to be slouchy - it will not be."
Very cheap looking. Looks nothing like picture.
"I loved this bra and took excellent care of it. I even washed it in a lingerie bag and nervous put it in the dryer. And almost EXACTLY as soon as the return window closed...this happened when I pulled it out of the washer. For as expensive as this thing is, I hope they refund my money or send me a new one. Will update after contacting them."
COULD NEVER GET THIS TO WORK. TOO HARD TO USE
"Another cheap pair of shoes made in korea. one shoe was smaller than the other and the sole of shoes do not even closely resemble the picture, the insoles had to be removed, last pair of fila's I buy too cheap to return,"
Did not like this dress
The fabric isn't as soft as I thought it would be. The band that should be just about the waist covered half was up my breasts. Awkward. Plus I had ordered a size larger than what I normally wear since the other reviews said it runs small to begin with.
Not sexy enough for me.  I needed it for a sexy vacation.  It did not meet the requirements.  I had to send it back
"I returned these earrings upon arrival. Not only were the earrings completely bent to the point of being flattened, but had I tried to unbend them they would have snapped apart. The silver dot is very thin, giving it a cheap feel. Just, not a quality product, but I mean you get what you pay for I suppose."
It was way to small and thin cheap quality.
"These socks are too tight. They are a stretchy material, not cotton. Maybe a cotton blend of some sort?! My biggest issue with them is that they are tight around the ankle."
"but it came all crazy jacked up and I even after letting it sit out for days to straighten out, it was still hella wonky"
"it was super cute....was being the important word there.  perhaps it's just supposed to be looked at and not used as a keychain because like many of the other reviews, the plastic Rick Grimes fell off the key chain bit and was lost forever!  painful, as the Rick Grimes from TWD would never do that...he's never leave his friend (ME!!)  Please do something to fix this problem FunkoPop.  I NEED this keychain!!"
"Not much different from an undershirt, except my Hanes undershirts don't come out of the wash wrinkled and shrunk like this did.  Well, I got what I paid for, I guess.  Maybe I can use it to clean windows with."
"The quality is ok for the price. I loved the style. The problem is when I put them on, I almost fell. Their sole and heel makes me feel very unsafe when walking because they slip very easily on tile floors. I didn't wanna take any chances so I returned them."
"very cool camo and nice fabric, but the cup is WAY too small. I laughed when I open it and saw how small it was. I thought it is for a child.
So maybe these are meant for very small people, but by NO way for an average size American. I'm no big guy, 5/10 , 163 lbs, not hung like a horse either, just normal size guy. The cup in this thing is not even remotely close to hold anything.
 Sadly disappointed from a product being marketed to the USA.that doesn't fit."
"It's fake, it change color less than a 4 day's and it's as small as quarter if not smaller. It's a piece of junk. I don't wear it and it's just sitting there. I will send the photo of the color change soon."
Not at all what was pictured
I can't decide if this dress looks more like a wet rag or a blanket! The worst is that I have to pay to send it back to GB! I'm beyond pissed!
"These were great at first, but the they shrank down to nothing! Can't wear them anymore at all."
Cute looking but poorly made. Glue was sticking out 8 flowers were peeling off cloth backing.
"Tore first time I put them on. So thin my finger poked right through. INCREDIBLY small, even for shaper tights. Would not recommend."
"Didn't really care for the color it wasn't as show, true to size but made out of cheap material not a comfortable shoe needs gels pads"
"Returned, too small and not best quality"
"Too long in torso, I am 4'10 and short waisted."
"it is the size and shape described, but the zipper broke within the first week and some other seams are breaking. also, the pink trim is fading to a grey-ish ugly color. Not happy with this purchase at all."
the only pair of french cut that was sent fit great the other pairs were brief and do not like the fit.
"The dress is very nice, however, the dress runs extremely small. There were stains and a tear in the dress. Also, the burgundy is more like a bright red. Nothing was done about any of it. Do not buy!"
"I'm 5'1"" and 102 lbs. Bought an XS- the neck hole was so wide/big that you could see all the way down into my shirt when I bent over, but it also goes super low even when Im not bending over- had to wear an inside shirt which just looks weird."
I bought these and instantly threw 2 pairs out! These are* Fake Hanes Sweatpants* nothing like the real ones. These are cut like clown pants and are huge and nothing like store bought Hanes Sweat pants. I'm really getting upset with all this counterfeit clothing over and over! These are like sweat shop pants cut all incorrectly too large and then then fabric is ultra thin ....nothing like a real Hanes
"I love Jambu shoes, this is the third pair I have purchased, so I thought I would try a new style. These shoes are so uncomfortable!!!  They rub on my ankle bone and my heel. I am a B width and they seem to run narrow.  I can't wear them, too painful."
Not as warm as i expected ok but not 40 below ok
A very poor quality T-shirt. Ordered a 4XL size and the shirt was probably somewhere in the neighborhood of what I would call a normal large shirt. Took over a month to receive the shirt. In the meanwhile I ordered another shirt with the same print from bikers life on Amazon and had the shirt in 2 days. Name brand shirt and size was what was expected. I would have sent the shirt back but I have a friend that weights about 170 lbs and it fit him perfect and he wanted it. I will never order from this Amazon vendor again. Very poor company to do business with. Buyer beware!!! I do a lot of business on Amazon and this is the worst review I've ever written.
Really strange fit and looked ugly.
"I was so happy with these pants when I first tried them on.. They fit perfectly!  I normally wear a size 18 and purchased the 3X.  They were comfortable, not too heavy, maybe a little long.. But I'm 5'7"" and just cuffed them and they still looked cute.  When I put them on to wear to work the next day.. Noticed a huge split horizontally across the butt and then a hole right in the, er, crotch of the pants.  For the price I paid for these pants, I was very disappointed and will never purchase from this seller again.  I have been looking for a good pair of black knit pants for quite some time, and I guess I'll have to keep looking."
It fits well but these leggings were so thin and lower quality then normal. I order this exacts brand of leggings for years ( they are literally my fav) and these I don't believe are real... or st least the ones I received.
Very big I wear size 14 and got xl cuz I like scrub little big this is huge I'm swimming in it
it it too high cut.
Purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. The shoes were extremely small both in width and height. She couldn't get her foot into them.  She wears a size 7 in most shoes and the 7 did not work. She is convinced that these are fakes.
"These were huge on my feet.  Very disappointing, because I loved the look of them-- but my feet just swam in these."
Didn't fit as expected. Too small but it fits my kids so they can use it with their dress up stuff.
faded after first wash... shrunk too much in length
True to size everywhere other than the bust where it is VERY small.
"I have actually never worn this.. because it looked really ugly once i got it.. I just ended up using a purple in a different style I got from the flea market.. I wouldn't suggest this watch unless you know what it looks like in person..almost wore it once, but end up just taking it off before I leave the house."
Too big in the chest area and the bottoms were a bit weird in the fit.
"These are cute slippers, but they must run small because the 6-12mo didn't fit on my 6mo old daughter's feet at all.  I think it's just the style of the slipper - Acorn makes a ladybug slipper, same size, and they fit wonderfully."
"I purchased these and a pair of brown Capri legging from the same company. The brown are wonderful, nice cotton. The black are shiny polyester. I'd never wear them to the gym or anywhere out in public."
"This is a very odd shaped shirt.  Love the color, love the design.  The neck... however.... I don't even know how to describe.  It is odd!  It is too tall, it raises up the neck similar to a mock turtle neck, it is overstretched so not only is it too tall it is too wide, almost like a boat neck but tall?!  I have no idea what to do with it, if I should cut it into a V-neck, but the way it is now it looks ridiculous on."
Not worth the $2.  It's just a sheet with horrible stitching.
"I'm 5'9"" tall and wear a 34D bra so I ordered a size L. I like the length but the fabric quality is cheap, cheap, cheap! I feel as if I wash it once it'll disintegrate!"
Thin sole.
"The advertising states that this is a ""one-size-fits-all"" hat - DON""T BELEIVE IT!!  I wear a 7 3/8 hat and I couldn't even get this on my head.  Either the manufacturer has a shortened measuring device - or somebody is being disingenuous with the hat specs!"
Standard fit too small
These boots are very uncomfortable; there is a hard plastic kind of feel at the inside of heel on the side making it impossible to wear these. Also the edge of these boots left a deep mark on both of my legs just by test wearing them for probably 10 minutes. Also the look is very cheap; to me they do not look real leather at all. Definitely they look better on photo then in real life. They went back.
These boots fit large. I may return them.
"These were immediately uncomfortable. My son has never had a problem with the width of his shoes, but these were just awful. He has worn all different brands of shoes in a size 12 for the past two years and never has he hated a pair of shoes like he did these. He said he could barely shove his foot in because they were so narrow."
A lot darker color than in picture.  Material seems good like other wrangler jeans.  I wear 38x36 or 40x36 in jeans and I ordered the 40x36 to be safe.  They are a bit small in waist feels like a38 in waist.  The length is unbelievably long! The pants touch the ground the waste is at my chest.  Not sure how to size these.
Button flie too hard touse
Bought this for Valentine's Day but had to return. Runs at least 2 sizes small and the opening fell in the back ; looked absolutely ridiculous! Nothing sexy about that!
Didn't seem to help at all.
"Their ""large"" tracks like a medium for other brands.  Decent design and cotton, but does no good when it's too tight."
I didn't like it and returned
Way too small for an adult.  This hat is tiny.  My kids will end up using it.
I usually wear a size 10 1/2 in Rockport shoes. Had a problem with the fit of this shoe in 10 1/2.  Length OK but could barely get my foot into the shoe - arch / opening too shallow. Nice shoe otherwise but I had to send them back.
"At first look, you'll it is an old lounge pant and packed in a new poly-bag.
Way too large for medium size, for me at least. Most of the stitches are not good at all. Finishing of the stitches is not a ""Reebok"" quality at all. I doubt if it is really fresh stock or if it is original Reebok brand new lounge pant.
Attaching the pics to see stitches quality."
Very unhappy with this item. DO NOT ORDER from China. Quality is poor and sizes are for small Asian women. If it's inexpensive there is a reason for it. I just had my second bad experience with ordering clothing from China. I was sent an email stating I should try to sell it because it would be to costly for them and me to return. Lesson learned!
Cheap material you can see right through it but it did fit right
"Careful!  This requires a special lamp.  At the time I ordered, that wasn't specified.  (I hope someone fixed that!)  When I discovered that requirement, I tried to return it.  Whoops - another unhappy surprise.  It's not returnable.  (That wasn't in the small print, either).
I'm pretty unhappy with the way Amazon handled this one."
I was so excited that I received my shirt early but sad to say. This is small. Like I can fit in it but its tight and I don't like that at all. I am a large so I bought the shirt 2x so that it would be a bit baggy but that was not the case. If you are a petite women this will fit on you fine.
"A swing and a miss. Womp, womp. The arms are very short, but two stars if you happen to be a trex bc it's cute and warm. But if you're tall and were born with normal, human arms you're in for a disappointment. It's too warm to be worn for show, and the sleeves aren't long enough to be worn when it's cold, so it's pretty much a letdown on all fronts."
Don't hold up well after washing and the size 6-12 months never stay on my 6 month old for more than a few minutes.
"My boy is a big fan of star wars, so I recently ordered some star wars T-shirts for him. There is one of these T-shirts, at least one or maybe two size smaller than the others.

Otherwise, they are good quality, not too thin, just perfect for fall."
I had to return these.  The sizes are on a European scale and it did not fit me well.  Dansko had an easy return policy
Didn't work well returned it
"This is a pretty bad shoe. It has a couple big problems, one that warrants a one star review. I tried the shoe on and only took a few steps in it on a carpeted surface, already the tread at the bottom almost instantly split and the white insole was showing through. It splits in the thin area between the treads because the grooves are large, its very hard to explain but I can guarantee the sole was splitting. There was no wear to the shoe when I received it so I know I received a brand new pair as per my order. Perhaps that is why many people report getting water in the shoe? Anyways this is a very good reason to avoid this shoe. If it happened to me within only a few steps of wearing I can't imagine it holding up to trail running.

Another problem is the shoe does not open up all the way, it is hard to tell from pictures but the tongue is sewn into the shoe at a fixed part, so you can only adjust the upper part of the shoe a few lace holes down from the ankle. This will make wearing the shoe with custom orthotics impossible as the orthotics will take up more room in the shoe which means your foot will hit the top of the shoe in a strange way. I can also feel a line or a heavy seam where my foot hit the top of the shoe at this part that does not adjust. It will adjust tighter if you pull the laces but will only go larger to a certain point. Because of this it caused pain in the top of my foot that I had not experienced with any other shoe. It is not designed like a normal shoe where you can adjust all of the laces to as wide as you want them to go.  Despite the wide design of the shoe, this is a big con for those with wide or high volume feet and those who want to use orthotics.

The shoe is also very hard and firm on the bottom, there is almost no padding or foam, it will feel like you are walking on a very hard surface.

The shoe is wide and true to size, if you have altra shaped feet this might work for you. However keep in mind the above points when choosing this shoe, I absolutely do not recommend this shoe due to the problems listed above, surely there is something else better on the market than this clearly flawed shoe."
"For $19.98 I kind of expected more. I don't feel any different than I was before. It's suppose to be a therapy-like glasses? Not working, unfortunately.

I'm guessing the hinges are where the problems are at. One side is very loose and another side is very tight. I'm not sure if that's how glasses are suppose to be, since this is pretty much the first sunglasses I've ever gotten for myself. Which was a mistake. I should have done research on what kind of glasses would look good on me and the measurements. As it's not the best fitting for my head.

Returning is on my mind, unless I get the results from the color-therapy.

I am writing this review after 30 minutes of wearing this glasses. About the 20 minute mark, I started getting this feeling in my eyes, not sure what that was."
tosmall
too clunky for me
"These fit me perfectly. I wish the hole in the front was a little more adjusted to be easier to use, but it's ok. These aren't all that breathable. which is why I give it a 2 star. I wish they were. THey already are briefs, so expect them to get stinky since there's not much air flow. With regular boxers, I don't have this issue. Briefs tend to get more stinky. I wish there were breathable ones, but haven't found any yet. Just be cautious when purchasing these."
"These are very pretty and very comfortable but the shimmer  painted all over the shoe peels off literally the first time you wear them.  Very disappointing, I had to return them.  It's a shame too because I really liked them."
Put these on every day after work. Within 6 months the bottom of the sole began to rip and  fall apart . The sole was made of thin cheap rubber that could not take everyday wear. Not worth the price.
"First pair of Sanuks I hated, they were so tight and stiff I still have not been able to wear them."
"#1)It was not burgundy as represented - it was PINKish purple!  Not even a shade of red. Wasn't even my not studying the color better - the picture was completely a different color than what I got.
#2)Yes, I read reviews that the shirt ran small.  Yes, I read reviews that suggested that if you have a muffin top or a bump you don't want to show that this is not the shirt for you.  OK fine.  I sometimes wear mediums, often larges - depends on manufacturers.  The large was not only snug, I could hardly get it over my shoulders.  I am a size 12, 5.9"" and this shirt looked like it would fit my friend's 14 year old granddaughter.  Not even a ""petite"" thing - while I was able to finally wiggle it down over my shoulders when it came to getting over my 38C bra I simply gave up & did not try to even get it on any further.  May I suggest if you want to give it a try and you're about my size go for the x-large."
Looks fake. Picture looks better than what it actually looks like. Returned it
"The IDEA in Style is there however the FABRIC IS SUBSTANDARD - Its actually made of CHEAPO- FELT! Wtheck... CANT GET wrinkles out, picked up EVERY  particle of dust and lint - trying to Return- Cheap product and embarrassing - would NEVER wear this OUT IN PUBLIC not at HOME! Bad"
Grandparents bought this for my 2 year old. It is not practical. It's a cute concept. It will lead to parents trying to carry this awkward and uncomfortable bag around the airport. The bar on the back is not padded so it rests directly and painfully along your back.
Bag is too small for both shoes.not as expected...disappointing!
"After a few washes they shrunk in height. I'm a big dude at 300lbs and 6'3, and they were definitely too wide, and too short after a few washes on cold. I don't recommend these at all. I'm disappointed since Dickies is such a reputable brand. I would have returned them, but I had them embroidered for work. There goes 50 bucks down the drain."
Returned the sweaters.really nice quality.
"Parts missing ( bar tool and pins)

The package does not include a bar tool and pins as described at sale site !"
"These sneakers look real nice, but the width is crazy narrow. I wish I could wear keep them, but had no choice but to return them since I couldn';t stand to have them on my feet for even a minute or two. Giving two stars only because they are such a nice looking sneaker."
"It's weird because I always buy The Rich color and it fits perfectly. When I buy the exact same size but in this color it fits too small, am I missing something? Do the colors also have different cuts? Can someone give me some understanding here."
This bra offered no support for my 34Gs. I used it to sleep in it for a while but now I can't wear it at all.
I feel like this these pants are mis marked. My son wears a 29/30 waste. He couldn't even button the waist it was so small and it's a 30 W
"This trainer is really nice. Measure your waist well and follow the real size. Doesn't roll, rating 3 because It has dealt with me. From belly blisters to training one side of my waist than the other. One side is smaller than the other because of of the side irons in the trainer was absent and I ye side that doesn't train my waist"
"Fits to big, didn't like the way it ft on me"
Very displeased. Ordered the dark blue denim twice and both times I recieved the black denim. Not at all happy. Really wished to have had the blue denim but I guess I'm stuck with the black denim..
"I bought an 8,5 and received a 9...a mess...my wife hate me :-("
This costume was made super cheap. It was supposed to come with a mask and that was left out. The third time I unzipped the costume the zipper broke and the head piece wouldn't stay on.
"Actually, there is nothing wrong with the product. The problem is in the sizing.  I have bought the same pair of jeans many times before from other retailers.  The size specified on Amazon does not match the size of other pairs I have bought.  Without being able to try it on, there is no way to know that ahead of time.  So, I returned them.

I love Amazon and buy almost everything from them.  However, I don't think I will be buying jeans from them again any time soon unless they figure out how to standardize the sizing so that it is actually the size you get or have a way to virtually try them on."
"I had bought a couple pair last year and loved them, so I ordered another. The one I just received had a badly stretched out fit to the waste band. Very disappointed and won't be ordering another one. Had washed them, so can't even return it to get my $35 back, which is a lot of money to waste."
these were certified fake from saltwater sandals do not buy and be cautious buying other brands on amazon. make sure they actually sell their brand on here.
can be used as a shirt but no way as a dress
Its okay bag. My daughter love it until it came a part from her books. I would't put to many books in it.
"I am totally disappointed. This hat is for a kid,instead of a adult."
"not the same kind of fabric as the green one I have, this one is much more see through and is not forgiving."
Xl was more like a med
"They were really hard shoes, so I returned them!"
"I returned it, coz it was too large for me. I didn't get the x-s size, so I didn't used it. When I saw this material, the quality looked quite good."
Very cute suit but the lining on the bottoms around the leg kept showing you would have to add an other Stitch to keep the white lining from curling over and showing. So cute though other than that but I had to return it cuz that would drive me nuts
It was too big for women.
"At $8.99, this jewelry set is way overpriced.  I get that it's plastic jewelry, but it's highway robbery to charge almost $10.00 for such cheap accessories.  Even the packaging is cheaply made.
It puts parents of Frozen obsessed daughters between a rock and hard place.  Our daughters want it so bad because they want to be just like their favorite characters, and then we have to spend money on crap accessories that break the first time they're played with.  Not cool.  It'd be better to spend your money on some pretty costume jewelry and just put Elsa stickers on it."
"Ordered clear,  looks purple outside"
Cute .... If you like large.... But I was looking for a petite locket.... It's about two inches wide  Not my style
Advertised as mainly cotton.  Actually NO cotton.  Also color not as shown.  Also quite long.  Would not reorder from this company.
"Ordered for the size my dad normally wears, too big."
hated it... oddly shaped too large and just horrible
"These are much smaller than the advertized size, I cant wear them. I went 1 size up and that even too tight."
One of the metal clamps were broke upon arrival. Can only tighten one side of suspenders now.
"CHEAP, not wide as described. Don't waste your money."
I wear a size 36 and followed the size chart and ordered a 34. Let's just say the pants were way too small. I looked like the Hulk trying to put on a pair of baby pants. I can't really comment on the quality of the material because I barely tried the pants on before the circulation was getting cut off to my legs. I'm returning them and ordering a size 38 to see if that fixes the problem. I'll update my review once they come in.
"These are just ok. Their relatively inexpensive which was why I ordered them, and the 2 pack is nice. But gerber brand clothing runs small. These run extra small in my experience. My son is almost 5 months old and already grew out of the 6mo size. The 12mo are just a little long in the legs. They are also cut kind of stupid in the legs. Hard to explain but they just aren't cut the same shape as a baby. With both packs I ordered, one was a softer fleece than the other, but they both get pretty pilly after a few washes. They're ok to fill in gaps in a jammies wardrobe, but I wouldn't probably get them again."
laces were thicker than I wanted.
Beautiful watch..wouldnt keep time..run for an hour or two then stopped..reset it 3 times..returned for credit
"Took it on one cruise for 7 days and at the end of the 7 days it was falling apart bad product . I didn't do anything wild and crazy with it .A couple of water bottles a couple towels in and few T shirts,  while I was exploring different ports of call"
"INVICTA---what a joke!!!  Junk, JUNK, Junk!!!
The only thing that is left after days is the fancy yellow box which, by the way, serves no useful purpose in life.  The hands have fallen off, the little dots on the face indicating the hours have fallen off and it costs more to send it in for service than the watch is worth.  That is, don't mind waiting for a half hour to speak to someone about getting it repaired.  What a SHAME that they are allowed to peddle such junk to the public. This is the only company I have ever written a negative response about."
The blouse bigger than what it says size
"I had bought this originally for my son in the hopes that it would shrink quite a bit, but to my surprise it did not shrink at all. Most 100% cotton t shirts I have bought have shrunk more than I would like, but this one, not even. So now I am stuck with a large shirt because I washed it and I can't return now that I washed it. So for those of you wondering if it shrinks in the wash, well it does not."
Bought this a couple months ago and finally took it out to wear it and it has a half inch round hole in the front that I didn't notice earlier.  You'd think quality control would have caught something like that.  So now it's garbage and still has the tags on it. :-(
"Because I needed them for a breast cancer awareness event, I had to keep them.  I'm not cool enough for the hightops."
"This is the worst tool set, must be for Mattel toy watches,waste of time, made very very cheap, had four different watches opened none"
"Tight across the breast line.  Snaps should be closer together as there are gaps showing your under things.  Fabric is flimsy and stiff around the collar line.
I won't wear this."
The crotch area is right and very close to my private area making it ver uncomfortable
Way too tight. I've purchased a number of Roxy flip flops throughout the years and these were the only ones that were too tight/narrow. Already purchased another pair and the new style fits perfectly.
"Recieved them in May, but did not start wearing them until July when ears were pierced. I removed them for the first time since July in August & they are already slightly tarnished except the balls. They were without a doubt cute to to start off with tho"
"I would give this no stars if I could. These shoes are definitely not oil and slip resistant. I work in a restaurant and almost fell multiple times. I had to avoid the kitchen for the remaindered of my shift. I'm not sure as to how I can contact the seller. Maybe my pair were defective, I'm not sure."
"my husband wears a xl, but this was way, way too small."
The picture is  deceiving. I bought a size up because I wanted a large fit and it is still very short. It doesn't even cover my butt.
Sizing is completely off (too large) and the cotton is coarse and uncomfortable. Hanes ComfortBand is much better for this low price range.
Seemed to fit and feel fine when I got them. After less than a week of wearing the heels started to fall apart. The sole of the shoe was literally peeling off from the rest with less than a few days use. Very disappointed in the build quality. The shoes looked and felt fine initially but unfortunately it didn't last so I ended up returning these for a refund.
"These are glitter in glue or something that is similar. Seriously I would not even take them if they were free. I got a refund, but why do they even make this junk?"
"I ordered these sandals in black. They look fairly good in the picture but I was so disappointed when I receive them.
They are too narrow the quality is too low, nothing comparable to the original Nine West shoes."
"The earrings are very flimsy and thin.  They arrived with a big dent on one of the hoops, so I sent them back."
"I ordered the 4T and found this to be extremely small.  Product quality is not great either, but the item is cute for the child I purchased it for.  I did order the largest size and will see if that fits better."
It wears out after a couple of months. Way Too Expensive for the Quality & the Life of the Product.
XL is what I normally buy for my husband.  He looked like an overstuffed sausage.  Gave it to a teen on the cross country team.
update now that I've had the watch for a little while i can safely say this is a terrible watch it looks good but keeps terrible time my watch loses over a minute a day had to reset every week don't know if every watch is like this but mine sucks
I wear a perfect size- but one boot fit smaller than the other. Returned
I'm not a fan of these yoga pants. The material is very obviously cheap and they don't have the same stretch as a nicer pair would have. I've never actually worn them out of the house the fit is so bad. There's no hug around your legs and the waist was too large.
Doesn't was well. Only two washes in and they look 5 years old!
shrank on first wash
Not a slouch beanie.
"This undergarment is comfortable, but I don't think it does anything for my figure at all. It's much too light weight. I just wanted something to smooth out my waist/thigh area a little and make my butt look better in dresses. I really didn't notice much of a different with this on. It might pull things in slightly, but does not improve overall shape like I would expect."
Really..... I asked for a 9 and a half and I got a 7 in mens ...Also the anti theft device is attached to the shoe. I really would like a 9 in half or my money back please.
Shrunk about a size and a half after going through the dryer.
"Not meant for those with wide feet.  I was excited to get them, and put them on right away only to take them right off.  Could not wear these for longer than one minute no kidding.  Waaaaaay too narrow at the toe.  I returned with no issues and received a prompt refund."
The hat was too small.  I returned it with no problems and was issued a credit in a timely fashion.
"I ordered the same size I've recently gotten for the kid, and it was much too small."
"Out of ALL my purchases from Amazon, I have been VERY IMPRESSED!!! However, I am a bit disappointed with this particular item!!! I purchased this dress, it arrived, but it is PAPER THIN and the QUALITY of the dress ISN'T THE BEST!!! Just an FYI for future buyers considering purchasing this item!!!"
"My watch requirements are very simple: Indicate the time to me plus some style, just like sun glasses: they are style plus protect your eyes. Date? No sure about that. Nothing else. So I don't need 20  useless indicators indicating all kind of c r a p  that I don't need to know about it. Also I want some kind of self-powered, kinetic is OK, solar of course is acceptable. Automatic is acceptable as well. Replacing batteries every two year does not appeal to me.  Most of the time the watch repair-man will not seal the watch properly, therefore the water proof thing is gone.  This watch complies with my requirements.  Plus really looks like a macho-man watch on your wrist. We will be doing some diving in the Philippines very soon, so this is the perfect watch for that.  Will report more soon.

UPDATE: Watch gains about 10 seconds per month."
"Very disappointed with the crocs brand and these shoes. I purchased these for my daughter and after just one month, one of the shoes had a malfunction with the light. It stayed on continuously for about a week, and then died. We tried to get the light to ""turn off"" but to no avail. Now we have one shoe that lights up and the other doesn't. This isn't the first time we've had issues with this brand. For the price you pay, you expect much better."
Definitely didn't fit like a size 11M. Felt tight and very hard to put on.
"Run, don't walk, away from Bella Vita boots.  The lo down on this garbage is that they fit amazing, they're comfortable and you love them...but then you have to actually walk in them.  The bottoms are completely smooth, which means you slip on just about every surface.  These are just plain dangerous.  Whatever happened to putting tread on shoes?"
"Pros: nice squishy inside and nice grippy sole.
Cons: plastic piece on the back of the shoe cuts in and does not flex at all.  I only wore them 2 times and will not wear them again. Why on a shoe would there be a completely hard non flexable piece of plastic on the back that cuts into your tendon. Poor design. I tried to give hem a chance but after 2 works days in them they only got worse."
I ordered a pair of regular ripped jeans and I got some that the button doesnt even go through and the ends of the pants are completely ripped when in the photo the ends are cuffed. It was not at all what I expected
Not comfy at all! Lamaze brand worked better for me
This bra had no support. I had to return it.
"I only walked around the house in these to try them on and was left with red marks above my ankles for a few days. The top of the shoe is quite rigid, and digs into your ankle with each step. It was very uncomfortable and painful! I can't imagine feeling this on my skin for more than 60 seconds! Beware!"
"Are these fake CK jeans? Bought many CK jeans before mostly from retail stores, none of them have dye problem, but this one does. Washed it and dried, all my other clothes were dyed blue in washing machine. Buyers be aware."
Do not buy except for your 3year old. Too small except maybe as a toy or travel emergency. Very bummed. Too cheap to return.
"They lasted 1 week and the broke, not good quality."
"Sooooo disappointed! We loved these and even went up a size from what my daughter wears. She usually wears 7/8 and we got the 9/10, but they were still too small. SO sad. The blue and beige were perfect colors for her new Totoro t-shirt. We even cut off the feet, but they wouldn't go past her thighs and she is a bean pole!!! I wish they would go up one more size."
"These are very nice, comfortable panties.
My complaint is that they are thin and snag very easily.  You need to take care because of this and should wash them separately.  Because of this I would not buy them again."
"I received my dress and found that there were deodorant stains on the left armpit area.
I reviewed my invoice to see if my item was new or used because I thought it said ""new."" I've yet to even try on the dress due to fact that if I do keep it- I have to dry clean it first. I'm not sure if I want to keep the dress or return it at this point.
Disappointed."
"Buy with caution: I got fakes, sold and fulfilled by Amazon.

I have an affinity for Frye boots and own a few pairs. I've tried on the Melissa Button boot before-- my sister owns them in the same size I wear, so I know exactly what to expect in terms of quality of craftsmanship, quality of leather, size, and fit. The boots I received were lacking in all types of quality, and were so small I could barely get my toes past the ankle, let alone my foot into the boot. They appeared to have been scaled down entirely, as they also were not as tall as they should have been. The workmanship on the sole was visibly sub-par. They arrived in a generic box (not a Frye branded box).

I know these are wonderful boots when they are real, which is why I bought them. I was surprised to find my Amazon purchase (again, sold by and fulfilled by Amazon, not a third party) was not a genuine item. I can only assume someone bought the real deal and returned these fakes for a credit. I don't know how else such an obvious fake could have gotten into Amazon's stock."
It doesn't even actually work it's just a prop. Bummer.
"Poor quality, shoddy. It doesn't tie well and looks stiff in some places and loose in others. Still nice for simplicity's sake."
The top of the bag folds over and is stitched down so you can barely open the bag when you unzip it. The leatherette is very heavy and the straps are very short. It's a tug of war to get things in and out of this bag. Ridiculous.
I waited way to long for this cheaply manufactured piece of jewelery. It took 3 weeks to get it. When I saw it I gave it away to someone. I have 5 or 6 stainless steel bracelets and this was not even close to the quality of my others. My suggestion to anyone considering this bracelet is don't bother. Look at the Triton or Stel bracelets because they are much better made.
Large is much too small.  I usually wear medium.  Purple color is nice.
Back in the 90s I had some Skechers boots like these so I was exicted to see this product. Those boots lasted so long I had to get them resoled. Imagine my disappointment when the snaps kept coming undone on these boots. The 4th time I went to re-fasten the snap on the right boot the strap tore. Cheap leather. I am returning these boots.
"Way too large.
I needed them, did not have time to return.
I am losing weight due to chemo.
Even if they significantly shrink, they will still be too large.
I don't want to buy Chineese.
 X-small is hard to find.
I trusted Hanes.
Small usually is a 4., I am a size 4.
Way too big."
Great shoe for school.  Excellent support and cushion but the liner in one came out in 5 days.  Will exchange and see how 2nd pair goes
"lighter weight than expected, almost flimsy"
"You get what you pay for, Nuff said."
"I love these boots. They look great and feel great. But, after wearing them only a couple times, the finish has started to crack and peel. It looks like a thin finish that was improperly bonded to the leather. I paid $80.00 for these boots on sale. They should be better quality. And Seychelles should have better quality control."
"These are cheaply made shoes.  They are advertised as leather, but they are totally synthetic other than the lining. Way too expensive for plastic shoes."
This shirt looks cute but was not like how it showed in picture size was bigger then what I got and it looked so diffrent
"It was way too short and the waist was not high.
Way too low on my bottoms."
The fabric is not nearly as heavy as my older Beefy Tees.  Still better than standard weight but not what I was expecting.  And not really worth the cost premium.
"unfortunately Sweatshirt is WAY to oversized. it does not fit like a normal oversized medium shirt. the sleeves are so long, I'm just swimming in it.  i can't wear it on one shoulder or both, it's so extremely big. I warn you buy a size down if you chose to purchase this. it's very cute and cut great around the neck, i was just not under the impression that you would be able to fit 2 of me in this shirt, it's like an oversized  large.  and warning if you want to exchange or just return, ALL shipping is on you so chose wisely SO your are not stuck. happy holidays"
"the extra support isn't supportive at all. this isn't my first pregnancy and I have some extra squishiness on the bottom of my stomach (hence the need for support), this strip is super soft and flimsy and just rolls down. returning due to not being effectively supportive."
Terrible watch. What you see is what you get
"Wish it had better support and foot cradling like the Keens do. They don't like it in the picture, but they are a bit bulky around the ankle. For the amount i spent on these I could have gotten something better."
I had to return this. I ordered an XL and I swear it fit like a Small.
"Received this belt and the VERY FIRST TIME I unsnapped it to put a buckle on, one of the snaps broke. Very disappointed. Would not buy again."
It doesn't look like it shows in the pictre
Looking for cuffs for Santa's boots.  These are much too small.  Just not good for this purpose.  Just a piece of fur with an elastic at one end.  Not much to write home about.
too small does not stretch at all
"I bought this as a gift and I chose the size according to the chart provided. It is SO long, I am sure the girl I bought it for can not wear it. I am living out of the country (my parents brought it for me) so I am stuck with it, and can not exchange it. Even for the measurements that I chose correctly, it seems too big. It is a Large. But the length is SO long, that it is probably a good 6-7 inches too long, and I am 38 years old, usually a size 10-12, and 5' 4"". Height should for sure be on the size chart!"
"This item runs very small. Arms are uncomfortably snug. Also, washed in cold water and hung to dry and it still shrank."
Sent it back it is ridiculously large
Worst thing ever! Don't buy it. The plastic strap snapped as soon as I tried putting it on. Wish I had read the reviews  befofe. I will be returning this waste of money and time !
"I bought several of these maxis at a bargain price at my local Ross store - ranging from $7.99 to $9.99 depending on the pattern. Initially, they seemed too good to be true, especially since finding cute maxi dresses for plus size women is practically impossible.

However, I'm sad to say that you really get what you pay for with these: several already started pilling enormously the very first time I wore them, and I've already had to throw two away after washing them maybe 2 or 3 times because the pilling was unbearable, both on the exterior AND the interior.

Bottom line: if you're buying these just for a vacation or a summer cover up, that's probably fine - but don't expect them to last because, sadly, they won't."
"Material is very nice but if you're even remotely muscular you'll need to go THREE sizes up to be able to breathe in it. I wear a US medium regularly and it hugs my arms and chest without being uncomfortable. The XL here was so tight that I could barely raise my arms up to take it off.  Pity because I love the design, heritage, and the material."
"Although it fits, the water of the fist wash of the underwear is so dark that obviously the dye are off to the water. Should it be the right  way thinking it is an underwear that next to your skin? Will the dye be harmful to you health? Such an expensive underwear should not be this way."
"I don't get it.. A lot of reviews say fits true to size or as expected, but I couldn't even put it over one knee.
Not as stretchy as everyone made it seem to be.
It was TINY. Quality seems fine. Feels thick. Would be good for work outs, if it would even fit."
"I ordered 2 pair of these sandals, brown and tan. They are cute, look well made of nice leather BUT they are verrrrrrry narrow, definitely not medium width! I couldn't even get them on! Had these sandals actually been medium width I think I would have been very happy with them...what a disappointment!!!"
"I actually loved the color of the dress, but it was too big and too long for me! So I had to send it back for a refund. Amazon was really nice about accommodating me! I really appreciate that."
First thing you notice is an overwhelming chemical rubber smell. It was awful and actually transferred the smell to my couch. I ordered a size 11 in womens. I was sent a size 41 (euro) but a 42 is a size 11. They were way too small. I ordered from another company that is true to size
Pretty shoe but runs small in size
"I love panache, but the wire started poking out of this one in under 3 months! Fail."
"These were too large so I returned them. I immediately did not like them when I opened the box, and even if they were the right size, I would have returned them. They looked cheaply made, and were very casual looking."
Just did not fit at all. The cups are really small so I had to pay to return it.
Kinda small / kinda tight.
"The shoe runs small, order next larger size for a good fit."
"They had no size chart, so I used the amazon chart and got 2x. Doesn't fit my 46"" waist. And there is nothing bigger. Guess I need to loser weight and purchase this later."
Cross is a little to big for around the nexk
They were cute but junk. The yellow batman signs fell off an hour into wearing them.
"I have always worn Sketchers. These run small. I wear a size 7 in every pair of Sketchers I have purchased, these run 1/2 size small and they are not easy to break in, either. Still trying to break them in. If you have a wider foot but can sometimes can get away with regular width, get the wide. I returned them once because I was sent two different size shoes, not sure if I am keeping these or not. Love Sketchers, but not these particular shoes. Only gave 2 stars for the quality is still good."
"I purchased this item along with (3) of the sister product - the ""stuff stax"".  Although I gave the ""stuff stax"" 3 stars (wish it could have been 2.5), this product only gets 1 star.  First, when I purchased this, the ad was not clear that this is actually a 3-piece system.  The (3) pieces consist of a flexible, plastic (maybe polystyrene?), molded tray with 9 compartments that fits into a bottom tray.  It is extremely thin material and has been sprayed with a burgundy colored flocking.  The flocking itself is quite thin -  about as thick as 3 or so layers of spray paint  -  and does not provide any cushioning what-so-ever for your jewelry.  The bottom tray is made of a thin, small pebbled - similar to a sandy surface - acrylic (or acrylic- like) material (mine has a crack in it out of the box).  The top is nothing more than a super thin piece of plastic that sits on top of the tray's lip. It does not attach to anything and is more of a dust cover rather than a lid.  I did see an ad here for a snap-on lid but it was as costly as the unit itself.  When I came today to write a review, I noticed that the price has increased dramatically.  I purchased this for $10.99.  As of this morning, the price is $17.17 so really watch the cost!

Since I had a small, 8"" drawer to work with, I relied on the dimensions given in the ad - my mistake. After receiving this and finding that it was too large for the drawer, I measured the (2) trays.  The bottom-most tray is 8 1/8"" x 9 1/8"" with an interior of 7 3/8"" x 8 3/8"".  The second tray which sits in it is 7 1/4"" x 8 1/4"" exterior but due to the way the tray is fabricated, the interior is only 6 3/4"" x 7 3/4"".

I did discover that the locking lids that come with the ""stuff stax"" fit onto this unit, providing a secure top and allowing these units then to stack on top of one another without moving around very much.  Oddly, the price of the average ""stuff stax"" is cheaper than the average ""jewelry stax"" - especially true now with the price hike - and you get the locking lid with the cheaper product.  Overall, I wish I had not wasted money on this unit but I am sure that one of my daughters will come up with a use for it."
"fits as expected but the mesh material is not sturdy enough so the tutu itself isn't as fluffy as I'd have liked. also, each layer is cut to a different length, creating a somewhat strange shape..."
Just ok. Not very bright and much smaller than I thought.
Necklace broke after a week. The clasp is tiny & there isn't much integrity between where the chain & clasp meets. Needs better welding.
One of my handles broke after only having it for a month.
"I bought this bead hoping to clip it on the end of my Pandora bracelet (next to the clasp).  On the product description, it says that the hole is 4.8 to 5 mm, but it definitely is NOT.  It fits on my 3mm bracelet with the other beads, but there's no way the hole is any larger than 3mm, so it doesn't clip next to the clasp.  Definitely false advertising."
"I love Bob's and Tom's and was looking for a less expensive alternative.  These were not it.  These are ok, but if you have worn Bob's or Tom's, these do not compare.  They are stiff and not as comfortable.  For me, it's worth the extra money to buy another brand next time."
"T shirt for a toddler! , I guess they think at Oakley that if you order XL  you're 6' 3"" 180 lbs. shirt was like a foot wide not made for someone with broad shoulders or back"
Too small for men and looks like a ladies watch. I'm very disappointed
He has managed to keep all of his other shoes in pristine condition. 1 day and the fronts of both feet are completely scuffed off. They fit beautifully on his wide feet but I'm really disappointed in the quality for the price.
"I bought these to wear to a water park to protect my feet from the hot pavement.  The insole came loose after just 45 minutes of walking around.  I kept taking the shoes off to put the insole back into place but after 10 steps, it would start riding up my ankle out the back of the shoe.  I then just took them out and threw them away -- then the shoes gave me blisters.  These shoes are absolute garbage and I'm baffled as to how they rate so well here."
One came apart when I tryed to get them out the box.
Nice ring but much smaller than it looks on screen plus the size was wrong.
"I am experienced runner -female - petite - i found shoes are heavy, stiff and my heels were slipping out if shoe when I ran. They have a ""bulky"" look on the feet. I returned.
I returned."
They are a bit too short
I returned it for a refund.  This was a solar watch that I purchased as a christmas gift.  It would not hold the charge.
"These shoes were too fake looking.  They fit well and the comfort wasn't too bad.  However, I agree with the other comments that stated the outside ""skin"" feels like it's about to fall off because it's so thin.  I went with the ""Stacy Adams Men's Portello Oxford"" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IXNP63C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
These look much sharper and the design break up gives the shoe a much better look."
They came in pieces!! So disappointed. .. total waste of my money...
Wouldn't fit a 10 y/o child. Flimsy material. Waste of money.
Clarks are usually very comfortable but this pair didn't work for me. The patent leather strip along the top of the shoe comes up higher than the leather so the stiff patent leather was pressing into my foot. I returned this pair.
"I just received the trousers a few days ago and cannot, yet, really comment on them."
Returned them. Didn't fit as expected. Not for me.
These boots are NOT high quality welding boots...within LESS than two weeks the sole of the boots came apart.  WASTE of money on these pair of garbage.  IF you are buying this for WELDING purposes it is a piece of crap!!!!
"I guess in small amounts, combined with actual makeup to make the color you need, this will work. But it's horrible on its own.

My face started to tighten just like a cosmetic face mask within 5 minutes on putting this on my face, then started to crack. It looked horrible and felt just as bad. I was following directions of a youtube video to do the makeup for the costume I was wearing and was frustrated to discover that the ""makeup"" hadn't spread evenly with the foundation brush, and I couldn't use a makeup sponge to help because it kept wiping off the first layer. I just did another layer with the foundation brush and looked streaked all night.

The only good thing about this junk is that it came off quickly. I also purchased the Mehron White Cream Costume Makeup, which my husband used. His makeup stayed put, didn't crack or peel, didn't tighten his skin until it was crinkled under the makeup, but was much more labor intensive to get it off. No matter;  I've now tested a touch of the blue and green liquid paint, scooping out some of his white cream makeup and blending it to the same color as the paint I wore with my costume. It's a world apart from the junk I bought and used for me. The colors say ""paint"" but since I don't use much of them it didn't matter. The white, however, says Mehron Fantasy FX Makeup, not ""paint"" but is exactly like the colored paint. Will not buy again and certainly can't recommend."
"Made of plastic, snug fit, cheap knock off. Do not purchase."
Bad quality too
"Even though I bought the same size in a different pattern that fit, these pajamas did not fit my son at all."
"I bought this for my wife, for something beatable to wear when horse riding, and after two years the band disintegrated.  It literally cracked and broke in half.  Inspection revealed several more cracks, and, sure enough, a gentle tug on the band broke it in a second place.  This wasn't a breakage caused by one mishap - it was a total materials failure caused by poor quality manufacturing.

As others have reported, this watch got scratched up, but so what?  A ""sports"" watch is going to get rough treatment, and I'd rather have a scratched plastic lens than a broken glass lens.  The band, on the other hand, needs to just work.

Now, most Casio watches have available replacement bands, but *not* this one.  A typical replacement band is in the price range of $10-$20, which is the price of this whole watch *with* band, which is probably why they don't bother selling just the band.  Fair enough.  But since that's the case, the band must be designed to last more than two years.

The only reason I can conceive for the band breaking down so badly in so short a time is from salty sweat corrosion, and a ""sports"" watch should be able to withstand salty sweat.  Hence the one-star rating: this watch simply doesn't live up to its billing.  Too bad, because before its degradation, it was compact, functional and attractive.

P.S. I've ordered a Casio from the ""Baby-G"" line, to replace it, as those are supposedly built to handle rough treatment (at three times the price).  Check back with me in two years."
Falls apart after a few washes
"Icky fabric and fake pockets. Returned
."
"Runs very small.  An XL fit my daughter, she's a size 8/10.  Pretty light weight material.  No content info/tag.  Supposed to be cotton knit but can't confirm.  My daughter likes them.  The cut is nice for her."
"Not a great product. The buttons go down too low, the fit sucks and I will not order them again."
"When I first got these, I was very pleased. They did everything as described. After about a month I started getting a popping noise from the sole of one of the shoes. I contacted Amazon and they were quick to let me exchange those shoes for a second pair. The second pair has just started making the same noise like something has come loose in the sole. It may be because of my size (6'2' - 340 pounds) but I thought they were designed to relieve that pressure when you step down. I have to say that the staff at Amazom has been very understanding and helpful. I guess I'll look for something else."
"I could barely contain my excitement when  they arrived three days later. When I took them out the box they looked really cheap. For $68 they need to look a lot better than $20 knockoffs. Nonetheless I figured no one would see them under my jeans, yet I couldn't zip them past my ankle. These boots were made for really thin legs. Since I am a  jazz dancer my legs are really defined so back to Amazon they will go!"
"I JUST OPENED THIS PACKAGE YESTERDAY AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE TO RETURN IT. IT RAN SMALL. IT HAD HOLES IN IT AND IT WAS RIPPED IN THE SEAM. IT WAS VERY, VERY WRINKLE. HORRIBLE SELLER...HORRIBLE CARDIGAN!!!"
"Sizing is  deceptive not true size.  Runs small. Suggestion, order one size larger than normal size."
"These shoes are lovely ,but they hurt. If you have narrow feet,this would be a perfect shoe. If your feet are wide, I would not recommend them."
I am exactly size 8 this ones run  small
Very cute but changed color within a couple of days
My friend did not like it.  It did not look like the picture on line. The quality was not what I expected.
"I'm a 7.5 (C) and by 8 (B), which I NEVER have a problem with as they are a bit big in the length. These I couldn't even get on - sent them back - reorder a size 8.5 - not sure if that'll work as they were too small as an 8."
Top part of the dress is about size 4.  Made a skirt  :)
"Fit fine except the leg opening are too big and it is not long enough. I am 5'5"" and feel like my books are going to fall out"
"The belt beginning is so thick, it is almost impossible to get belt through the belt loops on my jeans and is impossible when the end has to go through the belt loop a second time."
I like the look of the jacket. What I don't like about it is that the top button was already too loose that it almost fell off when I received it. The threads that tied the button to the jacket had been broken by 90%.I had to find someone to fix it for me. It could have been of better quality for the price I paid.
The picture of the ring looks better than it does in person. The ring is very very light in weight and it looks fake.i would not buy this again.
Looks good in photos.  Looks like a plastic toy on my wrist.  Wish I did not buy it.  Good for a 6 year old.
"Cute as this may be, it stinks! Cabbage/fishy smell. I put essential oil in it to see if it will mask the smell. After two days, better but still underlying bad smell."
"Runs really really really small. If it were to fit, it has amazing compression and would have been perfect."
They broke and when I wore them they became all cloudy
"was so looking forward to these shoes but they were like boats on my feet.  not sure whether to order a different size or not. they look cute and i love purple (difficult to find purple kicks). i am finding that clothes and shoes that are made in china are either way too big or way too small. i would only order these if: u like to take your chances that they will fit, and/or have the time to go thru returns and reordering, which isn't difficult at all."
Too big. Quality is ok. Color is nice. But way too big. Im 5'3 140 lbs and ordered a medium. Going to take in the sides
Received them yesterday with one of the earrings missing a stone...WTF? They are pretty but disappointed the one was broken.
"Fits like crap. When they say wide they mean really wide. Heel to toe, too wide. Wasted my money on this one...."
"Fell apart pretty quick, all the chrome wore of the chain after two or three weeks. Not worth the money."
"Got the colorful polka dots. Wore them less than an hour and got a giant hole in the seat. Looked them over and there are about a dozen or so little holes in them. I usually like this brand, but these are huge disappointment."
"Ordered the same style and size previously,perfect fit...this time was not the case they run small and the legs are like skinny jeans the denim even seemed thinner. Amazon was great as usual no problem with the return."
Very tight around the mid-calf. Small through the ankle and foot. Foot length is ok. Would not buy these again.
"Not as nice as I thoght, falling apart. :("
"The button cover fell off right away and had to hot glue it back on, which doesn't really work."
"Too big around tummy area and snug around breast area, so a smaller size would of not  have fit either."
"Before buying this belt I thought it was an awesome idea, a belt that you can put on and take off easily! But after getting it I found out it wasn't so. I travel a lot and everyone I have to take off my belt the magnet gets stuck in itself. Also I need two hands to put it on which defeats the purpose for the magnet. One last thing is that if I wear a jacket that is long and put my phone in the jacket pocket it sticks into the belt's magnet. Noble idea, bad design!"
I should have listened to the reviews - these are giant & just don't look right!
Worn for minutes and there were already tons of pulls . Quality not very good
Is not very comfortable
"No way, no how are these flimsy bras going to do *anything* for my D's. Nope. I took a chance based on another reviewer and sure wish I hadn't."
"Massively oversized I know the description says 13 inch and loose but these are way to big, if you're in the market for dickies go with the 11 inch regular fit. These will fit you like pants."
"Romper looks like a night gown. Was not V neckline like picture shown, it came as a scoop. Bottom piece was not flattering at all, seemed too long and straight down. Had to return."
"Big, for my 2 month old but still cute. Bow was flimsy so I super glued it.
Gotten a lot of compliments"
"The price was a good deal, but this dress looks cheaper than even the price would indicate. The size small was more like a slightly narrow kids large(10-12)--ie it would be long enough for a kid in the 4 ft 7 to 5 ft range, but they would need to be average waisted or a bit thin(waist/chest are like a typical kids 8). Ridiculous. I altered it and it worked ok."
"I ordered black and white! I received all white. I needed them for a special occasion tomorrow, now I have to do something different. Not very happy!"
it was too large I ended up giving it to my friend and it fits her perfect
"I've had these clogs for a few months and have only worn them indoors.  Now the sole is separating from the clog at the heal.  The material above the sole is starting to crumble, which makes gluing the parts together a temporary fix.

These are the last Sanita clogs for me.  I will move up to Dansko with my next clog purchase.

Poorly made resulting in short life."
"I bought this Tunic to wear with tights but I was not impressed with the material nor the fit, do not recommend buying this top."
Worn once and jewel came off
"I was looking for a comfortable shoe that I could use for walking around NYC in the winter. My son wears a similar model as part of his school uniform. I didn't realize from the picture that these were almost identical to those until I put them on. They do look like shoes for little kids, just in a bigger size. I'm all for a casual look at times, but these just look immature and uglier in an adult size. Also, the arches felt very high and the faux suede did not look like it would last.  The same material on my son's shoes looks very bad after he's worn them for a month. I ended returning these and bought a pair of Keen's that cost almost twice as much, but look and feel much better."
cheaply made.....
"I feel like this dress is advertised to be floor length, so I bought a medium and I don't even think ordering up a size would have helped with length. While it stretched nicely over my 7 mo, 34"" pregnant belly and my 34F chest beautifully, I'm close to 5'8"" and it hit the middle of my calves in the back.
The green and blues weren't as vibrant as they are in the picture. Overall I'm not happy with this purchase, especially since I basically paid Prime shipping price and received it a week later."
"the shipping was waaay too slow - 8 B. Days. for the IRON FISTS, the white fade is DEFINITELY  not as flamboyant as the pic shows. Thank Clever lighting and photo shop for that. In real life they fade is WAAAAYY more subtle. As long as you head my warning and don't expect a bright white fade and picture a more light sanding Than you won't be disappointed like I was. In the end they're still levis and pretty nice shorts so I'll keep em bcuz my review is strictly to lower the expectations of the buyer for these exact shorts. I gave 2 stars cuz I'm coming from a pov that was expecting suhm else."
"Right out of the box it was somehow cheap looking. Narrow strap, not exactly what you expect from genuine leather. Sorry but I'm sending it back."
Looked at this a long time because I like the face shape. Finally got it at a good sale price and I am disappointed. The bezel has no sparkle and the clasp sticks and is cumbersome. It has a cheap look to it. This ended up not being a good buy at all and if I had paid more for it I would have boxed up the next day and returned.
can't ride in truck with them on the big clip in back sticks out
We paid good money for my sons foot ball cleats and they run so small.  We swapped cleats with another player on the team because he had smaller feet but we bought these a size larger and they still didn't fit.
"This is a very beautiful dress on the model but on me was a different story. I'm 5'3"" 145 pounds with a medium sized waist and a curvy back side. The material of this dress is super thin and the dress was so long I couldn't walk normal in it without tripping. From the back view if you're not wearing a slip or some kind of undergarment underneath, it looks very inappropriate in my opinion as the material is so thin and fits so loosely it drapes over my butt in a very exposing way. I was sad to send it back because it really is a beautiful dress, I guess it just takes the right figure."
The buttons immediately fell off and you have to take the whole costume off so the kid can go to the toilet. Not. Good.
I received this dress and it was ripped!!!  Awful quality!  Not worth a penny!
"As I've indicated several times, this robe is not ""Cotton"" based.  I'm not confident that I could identify the fabric; however, it was not something what I can use as a bathroom."
Reminds me of a wind breaker material I returned it.
"These shoes fell apart after 4 weeks during which I wore them for 7 days.
The sole separated from the cloth upper part,
Very poorly made. I'd like to get my money back!"
"I bought it for my mom and it was too tight , now it's just there lying around.  Wast of money."
returned--wrong cut for me
It was defective. One LED didn't work. And one function didn't light correctly either. The bad led shows there is no quality control.
"Awful product. Don't waste your money; it is constructed from super cheap plastic which deforms easily, and lenses are pure trash."
Looks like jewelry from a Cracker Jacks box
This isn't a cute bathing suit but I got a 2/3 instead of a 3T. Not only that after the second wash the strap came off. Very disappointed.
The neckline very quickly stretched out and was loose.  I purchased a small and after a couple of hours it was stretched out and loose and exposing way to much skin.  I may try it on again with a tank underneath but the fit is slim otherwise and that might make it to bulky so will see about sending it back.  Material quality is just average.  I like the pattern.
its a cute wallet but you cant put alot of stuffin it and it won't shut the buton insodeis broken or put in worng
"THIS WATCH WAS BROKEN WHEN I RECEIVED IT....THE DIGITAL NUMBERS KEPT BREAKING UP IN THE LAST 2 DIGITS !!!!!  EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING and I was NOT A HAPPY CAMPER....I have not yet Dared to try and Reorder, because I am afraid they will send me another broken one....I HAVE USED THESE Watches forever,  however NOW I am afraid to reorder.....I may try to reorder on a day that I can be prepared for a Broken watch arriving if I reorder."
Had to return runs small and narrow.
"Not the usual quality of Dearfoams. Too small, and they look ugly on the feet.. Top is too short."
I thought it would be a better fit.. .I wear the shirt to sleep what ever size you are going  buy by 1 1/2 to 2 sizes smaller.. Super long and wide. Great material! That was nice
Do not fit comfortably and do not look so nice on.
My baby had them off within 10 minutes. But they're otherwise wearable so I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1.
This pants is a slim fit for teenagers.
"Polyester, not cotton and at least a size smaller than marked on the bag."
"I like the look of them, however they are tiny."
very small. should never be advertised in Big Mens
Waist size is ok but leg ended wider not like the image
"I liked the style but the fit just was't right. They were very uncomfortable, they had hardly any padding in them."
"These may be ""no pinch"" at the top, but the elastic on the bottom was much too tight. Very disappointed. I wear a size 4/small, but these result in serious VPLs!"
way way way too big and I mean I m big but not that big to have me drawers fallin down
Very Small.  If you a baseball coach these are not for you.  Get the radar paths and you will be satisfied.
"Not the right style of bra for me.  Armholes are very restrictive and it was, overall, uncomfortable."
make your feet sweat more so than cotton socks. if i was reading this review i would pay a little extra for cotton socks instead. don't get me wrong ill still wear these but they will be my backup socks when i haven't done my laundry
"The product is described as assorted colors with a photo to show different colors...I don't consider 4 shades of brown, assorted colors. I should have listened to other reviewers with the same experience...live and learn and I have learned not to trust this label or seller again."
"First of all, the magnet is not as strong as I expected. You have to get within an inch (or less) of most metal objects for it to work. The second problem is not giving any instructions at all. If I didn't already know some tricks this would be completely useless. The third problem is the size. Unless you're a child the ring will probably not fit. I'm a medium sized adult and can barely get the ring on and off. The last problem is the integrity of the seller. They enclosed a small note practically begging for a 5 star review. Part of the note says ""We have posted positive feedback for you and hope you do the same for us"". Newsflash: Sellers do not post feedback about customers! This is a blatant false statement. The seller also asks that you email them first if you aren't giving them 5 stars. This is one magic gimmick that I will rarely or never use again. I definitely do not recommend buying this item."
"The online page for this item claims it is 100% cotton. When I received the item, it contained 4 gray (heather) pairs of underwear, and one black pair. Although the black pair is 100% cotton, the gray pairs are 75% cotton, 25% polyester, and much warmer than the cotton ones. In fact, the gray ones are too warm for summer use. Regardless, I am miffed at the false advertising. I would not have bought the item if I had known I was buying a cotton-poly blend. How do I return this for my money back?"
very much not expected
"I loved these in the picture, but my feet hated them. They were so high w/out much platform in the front, so I felt like I was leaning forward when walking. I returned them."
"These are very long, very disappointed in them."
"Such cheap material, too small, and doesn't look like the picture"
"I ordered size 4/6. I must have gotten the biggest size they had. There is no size shown anywhere on the tags, but this is big enough to use as a tarp  for my car. The color was not as shown (much darker shade of Navy than pictured). Since the item was only $5.47, and it will cost me a great deal more to ship it back to the UK, I am going to find a very large friend to give it to and cut my loses."
3xl runs short and small
"I bought this for myself (size 8.5) when it arrived I was excited because they are really nice shoes, Tried them on, and had to give them to my 9 year old daughter who wears a size 4, they fit her perfectly!!"
I returned this product.  It was not very comfortable. Would not recommend buying it.  Gapped a lot on sides. Too short in toe area
"This product was purchased for a shoe size that is in the middle of the range for this product - Men's Medium (9-11).  It will not fit a men's size 10 US.  Otherwise, the product is extremely well made, excellent materials, design and really superb in everyway; but I would maybe consider a smaller size."
Loosening all the time. Useless.
"if you enjoy having your ass cheeks hang out the bottom of your undies then this product if for you!  Side note, I do not have a large posterior.  Not even close.  So if you have a big butt, just know your cheeks will hang out the bottom."
"This wallet was made just fine, but it is a little short.  Checks and bills don't fit well in the provided compartments."
"Material is too thin, shows every bump, my butt hangs out, way too much excess material at the hips so it flops on the sides. Looks great on the model, so I'm assuming you have to be the perfect shape and size to wear it."
The soles came apart 5 days after the return window closed. Old Stock?? What am I supposed to do with it now?? Money wasted!
"I read the reviews on this and saw that a lot of people said that they came lighter then they were expecting. I have purchased other green amethyst jewelry (not online) and knew that they often were lighter than expected. So I got them anyway to match another set I had. However, when it came the gem was completely clear. I had never seen a green amethyst that was clear (looked like a fake diamond) so I quickly returned it and have already been refunded the money. I would not buy these."
"Really soft and comfy, but it pills a lot and right away. After ordering XL to find it fits like a L at best, I ordered the XXL to find it fits like a tight and short XL. When I washed the XL and dried it on low heat to avoid shrinkage, it shrunk to fit like a large M."
"I am so disappointed. When I read the reviews that they run somewhat big I honestly thought that people were exaggerating.
No, they were not. I'm normally a size 7.5 so I ordered a 7.5 AND a 7 because of the reviews. Oh boy... the size 7 is still too big. The toe-box is so wide, it's unbelievable. The whole shoe is WAY too big!!!"
"One would think my wife had duck feet. They are small but she requires a very wide width. It was hoped that these would work and fit adequetely but alas they didn't and I feared taking them in to have them ""stretched"" as surely that would have voided any warranty..... As it turned out and if memory serves me right, a return was attempted but the company sent them back saying they had been ""worn"". Well, obviously one has to try a pair of boots or shoes on but apparently she either got a scuff on one boot or one got put on the boot during shipping either to us or from us back to them. I didn't notice anything and frankly all she was concerned about was fit so if the boots arrived scuffed neither of us probably wouldnt have noticed as she merely tried them on, walked about the house and knew immediately that no amount of ""break in"" would be sufficient to allow her to wear these boots.
If you purchase from this company inspect carefully the product when you receive it and if you return it make sure to repackage it very well is all I can say"
"Ordered 2 sizes larger and still needed 2 more sizes larger (I wear a large, ordered 2X, needed 4X). The bodice is stiff, almost molded (reminds me of the snap on clothes for Barbie doll style toy) and not anatomically appropriate."
I got 3XL and they fit more like L (size 12)
"SHEDS EVERYWHERE. Sooo cheap and bad quality. But adorable. Such a mess. I washed it first, still covered everything in fluff... OMG."
"The glass eyes are missing on the full t-rex (in picture) and of course do not light up. Would have sent
them back but he loved them anyway."
"This costume could have been amazing but I had to many issues with it to give it more than two stars.  The material is thin and a little itchy but fairly warm.  I am 5'7"" tall with a longer torso and average leg length.  The torso in this uniform costume was way to short and very uncomfortable.  It would have been tolerable if the material was more giving but it did not stretch at all lengthwise.  The darts for the bust was lopsided so my bust looked quite odd.  I tried to remove the darts but, the material had been cut so the darts had to be sewn back in by me in the lopsided manner.  You absolutely can not sit down if you are longer in the torso.  Better material and a little more length in the torso would have alleviated most of the issues.  Forget the darts and get a stretchier material."
One glove has a hole by the thumb
I read reviews that said this sandal had arch support.  It does not.  I have plantar fasciitis and these hurt the minute I put them on.
Buttons in the front always open and for my average size 9 month old baby it was almost small
I am a little disappointed in the sizing chart. I have a pair of timberland boots that are 10.5 wide so I orders the large set of spikes. But they barely fit on my pair of boots I really need to stretch them out. I would recommend buying a size bigger then you actually need if you want them to fit your boots well.
Tights slid down and the waistband would not hold. Awkward to wear. Had to be constantly vigilant. Constantly pull up tights
"very disappointed with the quality. Ask for Heat 32 degrees. It was a Therma something. 69.00 Then tax. The Jacket had a ticket on the sleeve
$23.50!!! What the heck- sent it back. Ordered a real Heat 32 degrees. Never again"
Way smaller than it appears in picture ...  and I ordered an extra large to be very flowy.
Turned tarnish
"I only wore this hat 3 times and not even 3 hours worth of wear put together and its coming apart. this hat is nice looking but won't last a month if you actually wear it, it comes apart where the colors change."
"it runs small, I have several tops that fit fine that are mediums. I had already taken the tags off so I did not return it. I should have tried it on before removing tags. But all of my other tops are med"
"DISAPPOINTED!  Read reviews thought I would be lucky, so I ordered.  It is heavy, scratchy, doesn't hang right, looks poorly made and took longer than I expected to arrive. I've tried to give it to family and friends, because I believe the cost to send back would be as much as I paid for it.  Sadly still have top, I couldn't even give it away."
looks cheap.. didn't like it at all and it fits huge for a small girl like me.
"I normally wear an 8 and have a narrow to regular width foot.  Read the reviews and they said to go up 1 full size so I ordered a 9. The shoes are way too wide. The length may be ok but it's hard to tell because they are so wide and my foot slides down.  The toe box is a little strange in fit.  I normally love pointed toe shoes but these are just not wearable for me. The look of the shoe was nice for the price but unless u have a wider foot, you may not be able to wear these shoes."
34x36.  not enough room in the mid-section
The first wearing was fine after being wash was sliding Dow my ankles
These are just normal black socks that I paid WAY too much for! So irritated.
"My son LOVED this, but it came with a hole in it and we have to keep blowing it up. One of the elastic straps broke within the first few days too."
The straps were so wide they would not stay up.  The bodice was sewn like a 50s babydoll nightie...Tight under the perky boobs and gathered under the armpit area so it poops out sideways.  I returned it.
About two sizes two small
I am a loyal VIV legging wearer...bought these to try. I found they fit a bit too small for the plus size.
I'm not happy with this ring at all. The frog is huge i really wish that it had been about half that size. Honestly I wish I didn't purchase at all i hated it so much that I gave it away
"These shoes are super cute, however they run large and narrow.
I wear a 9 and they slipped off the back of my heal when I walk.  I went to a store to try on the same style in a size 8 and they are too small! Why they don't come in 1/2 sizes is beyond me.
Had to send them back, so sad!"
Cuter in the picture than in person.
"Pretty shoes & likely would be comfy, but fit way too small. I ordered a half size larger & even that was way too small. I suspect ordering a size & a half up might work. But they only go to size 10...& the 9 & 9.5 did not fit me...so no luck."
"Light and very flexible, it seems but even after following the sizing chart, I purchased a bigger size and didn't even attempt to hook it together. I understand it's supposed to be ""tight"" around my body, but I wasn't going to try this one."
Well made ring. BUT. The stone is much lighter and looks like it came from one of those things where as a kid you put a quarter in and got a lil toy.
"Spend the money on a real pair, these feel like plastic"
The sandals are super cute but the left sandal hurts my foot where the strap is. I can only wear them for about an hour or two and I have to change because they cause too much discomfort. Bummer!
I ordered womens large and it looks and feels more like a girls small or medium.  I am very disappointed
One of the pins for the watchband broke after a week. There is no backlight.
"I am not happy with the feel (thin, cheap) of the polyester fabric and also the sizing. The jacket is too short in the front- just below the chest. I am definitely going to stop buying clothes online from overseas sellers! I tried to return the jackets (purchased 2, inadvertently) but the shipping fee was almost the same as the purchase price so it wasn't even worth it to send back...just giving them away to friends or coworkers who may like them."
These were about 2 sizes smaller than the size shown. Returning.
"I really wanted to like these shoes and I did like them on my right foot, but the left shoe was noticeably tighter. I thought it was just me and I gave them a week to break in, but after that time, the left foot was still a lot tighter and the right looser. The left shoe because it was tighter seemed to develop bend/wear lines on the top of the shoe faster. The right shoe still looked fine.

After reading another review of someone having different sized shoes, I returned them for a refund. Probably won't try another pair of Rockports unless I buy them in a local store to make sure they are the same size."
"These boots are now made in China, quality dropped.  Chemical smell. Develop leaks.  Useless 'celebrities' thought it was 'kewl' to be seen in them and so greed took over. And another excellent product bites the dust.  Save your money.  Vote how you buy.  Look for substance and real quality and fair prices."
Fits too snug and not purple in colour but more burgundy.
"Once again, lack of info. on where it is made, netted an undesired results. IF I KNEW IT WAS MADE IN INDIA, I WOULD HAVE ORDERED A SIZE LARGER. THE BLOODY THING SHRANK TO DEATH AFTER WASHING. I WILL NEVER  BUY IT AGAIN."
I should have read the reviews more carefully. Very disappointed in the quality and fit. I ordered Arizona fabric and they sent plain brown .I won't order from this company again.
"Nice but thin but the main issue is the sizing is way off, so it's guess work as to what size to get"
Fit great and looked great - for the entire 4 times I got to wear them before the whole front toe strap ripped out of the shoe when I was walking to my car at my office. Guess you get what you pay for.
"Don't throw away your $$$.  These boxers did not fit as expected, very baggy, super thin, waistline is huge.  SELLER WILL NOT RETURN OR EXCHANGE PRODUCT."
Hated this shoe's ribbon returned shoe
too narrow at the toe.  I gave them away
"The problem with this shoe is the buckle. It looks like a standard fastener but it is not. I can't find the words to explain this fastener, but it is very difficult to fasten and unfasten. I returned these shoes the day after receiving them because of the fastener. You have to see the shoe to understand the problem. The picture doesn't show the problem"
bad cut - neck opening too large - sweats are not necessarily attractive but this one looks like an oversized poncho
"Way too Small, never again!"
"This is WAY too small.  I have a 32 inch waste.  So, I ordered the XL.  OMG.  My large balls and scrotum didn't come close to going in the pouch.  Also with it being too small...my ass also didn't look good.  Waist of $$ for me."
"These are slightly snug fitting. But the biggest issue is in the back at the ankle... the pink part, in the middle of the ankle, inside of the shoe... you can't see it, but you can feel it. Under the fabric is some sort of seam. I was on the fence trying to decide to keep these or not...and i'm sorry I decided to keep them. I wore them today for the second time for a few hours out doing errands. I couldn't wait to get home and take them off and sadly add them to the donate pile.  The backs of my ankles can't take the pain! And I could do without the memory foam foot cushion - not really all that comfortable.  I wish I could find a new pair of my old pair!"
"I am usually a 9.5, so I thought the size 10 would be fine, and it is still small.  The part that goes between the toes is OK, but perhaps due to the sizing is uncomfortable.

They are well constructed and they are just flip flops.

I have seen great reviews for Keen, so I might try again with a shoe.
Thanks everyone for the reviews.  This is just my experience, I honor those who love the shoe and the brand"
even i am 180 cm and 67 kg but this is too large for M
Order a half a size down. otherwise they have this extra space in the back and your foot WILL slide forward.
"Glad I didn't pay much for this product. The seams are poorly sewn & ripped easily, despite the size being right for me."
"I often have difficulty envisioning the size and details on Amazon.  I wish they would place a Quarter by earrings to help judge  size.  These would have been spectacular if they had been at least as big as a quarter or, better yet, a half dollar.  And I did return."
"My son has had this bag for a year and a half about now. He's in Pre K, so there's not much going into the back pack, but there seems to be a problem with the bottom of the back pack.  It's wearing and almost seeing some holes??? UUmmm I put more stuff in my  back pack than he does and his back pack is getting holes?  Quality is a little bit of a problem here.  My kid love power rangers though."
"Eek, I must have missed something when I read the description. These are old lady pants. They're just like the double knit polyester leisure pants you might find at the discount store. They're going back."
Got these back in September. I remembering trying them on and thinking that my left shoe felt significantly tighter than my right shoe. I figured I just needed to break them in. Its been three months and Ive taken them around 25 miles and my left shoe is so tight. Ive tried re-lacing them and stretching them. Its a shame because I am training for another half marathon and will need to buy new shoes as my left foot always feels constricted. The size is the same on both shoes but there is a noticeable defect in the left shoe.
"First of all I could not say how it fit as I bought this product to wear on Halloween night. Unfortunately when I attempted to put on the costume, my wife pointed out that the zipper was broken, therefore it could not be used. Very sad about it but it is a defective product"
Broke the first time i put it om.
I purchased these after buying and loving the green doodle butterfly pattern. I can't keep these looking clean. I think the material is just difficult to keep from scuffing. I wore them only a few weeks and they started to look very dirty. I've scrubbed them and have had no luck making them look good enough to wear again.
"Very dissapointed!

Please return the old crocs soft to the skin.

I can't even use them even just for home use. It hurts!

That bad... :("
"I have large breasts but not giangtic breasts, the bottoms fit great but the top would maybe fit Barbie's niece Skipper when she started puberty. "
"The only positive thing I can say about this dress is the print is really pretty. I got this dress in size Small and it's too small and too short for me.
The front of the skirt portion stick out in unattractive way that it's like a dress with a flair from the petticoat skirt. But, it's the wannabe version.
Anyway, as I bent over, I could see my whole butt cheeks!!!

Unless you want to give people a free view of your behind then go for it.

Can anyone show me how I get free sample and write honest review? I'm not sure if some of the reviews are honest. I'm 5 feet and 100 lbs for reference."
This shirt is way too long. I ordered the correct size but it is so long I can wear it as a dress. I am 5'5 and it goes down to my knees. I will not be able to wear this out in public as the length is too long and it looks funny.
"I normally wear a size 6.5 in Franco Sarto shoes. I ordered one size larger because I like to wear ankle socks in my boots. It turns out that this boot was too small with bare feet. As for the quality, I think they would last one season, but I'll be gifting my pair to someone with smaller feet."
"So did a lot of research to make sure I correctly measured and such, turns out the cup size was too big.  The band fit fine, so on to find the right cup size.  The Natori I have purchased in the past tended toward smaller cups that was not the case with this purchase. The product was sent back the next day.

It appeared to be well made and the material felt nice but as I stated it was the wrong size in the cup."
Change clip won't secure.
"I was so excited to find this shoe in wide widths but there is nothing wide about them. In fact, they fit more narrow than a normal shoe. If you definitely need a wide width, this sizing of this shoe will not work for you."
"1) . Bills cannot fit unless you folding them. Why do you need a long wallet than?
2). Chain is unbelievably heavy and long but does not look secure from materials it's made from.
3). If you put more few coins in the zipped middle section it will look like a frog."
"Don't order these if u r looking for a swim suit with attached skirt as I was and am used to. The bottoms are the width of a short 2 piece bottom. they flow into the strangest piece of suit, a flesh colored piece of stretchable material with somewhat of a hold in power, maybe. However, this piece of elastic is opaque, not quite see thru and is long enough and thin and stretchy enough that I can fole it almost in half lengthwise almost to the top piece. And it still wouldn't hold me in and I weigh 135 lbs. It is a very nice top, fits well, looks good and the color and pattern of the whole thing is great. Too bad it isn't attached to an actual swimsuit. Very disappointed and I won't buy this brand again. My advice is save your money and buy this brand on any other item with a great deal of caution."
"Quality low.  Bad design, no flaps or fastener on large cargo pockets so stuff just falls out, like my wallet, etc.  not what I expected from union bay after buying from them from many years.  Brand was just trashed for me.  Will not trust it over any other random brand now.  Tricked me once."
Scrub has two pucket ( one out side and the second inside the scrub )
"Made out of the same material that hollowed costumes are made from and fit the same way. Purely awful. Maybe you could use it as a nightgown, but the bottom would tangle around your legs. Perfect length but is so loose around the breasts and I am ample size F, so if you are smaller, beware."
"Much too small and ridiculously slim through the thighs. I'm a M but ordered large based on previous reviews. Even these are too small! If you still want to buy these, make sure to order 2 sizes up!"
I'm honestly very disappointed with the quality of these shoes. I've used only 3 times and has taken off them almost entirely zuela. I thought they would be more durable and not buy you recommend. I hope my money back because I feel cheated
"my biggest complaint actually was the color is a dark green not at all what I wanted. too small, I may exchange for another color and size."
Very cheaply made! Feels like the kids play jewelry that comes out of the bubble gum machine. Think this was made more for kids play time!!!
Did not work out of the package.  Put a new battery in it and it still did not work.
I returned this  - it was something for a child.
Not a good tennis shoes. Hard to walk or workout with it without turning your ankle. Not the normal Reebok quality.
"Sorry to say, but this is the worse bar I have ever dad, and I have a number of those .I tried to wear it for the first time yesterday and it immediately bent making it worthless. Do I return this item to you?

Thank you
Roger Nicolini (Nicolinir@aol.com)"
"These sandals are too flat, no arch support, not comfortable, especially for big men.
I had to return them for Rockport Rocklake  Backstrap, much,  stronger, better quality with good arch support."
They tend to roll down at the waist..
"I've had this hoodie for about 1 year, the first time I washed it the zipper broke off, so it's now virtually useless.  I'm very surprised as I always though that Champion was a quality company that sold quality merchandise...given my experience with this product, I'll likely not be purchasing anything from them again.  It's also likely too old for anyone to stand behind so i guess I better start looking for another hoodie..."
"If you are a straight male, these are not for you."
"There's not much to say about these socks. They are simply OK. They are basically average medium-weight socks, fairly comfortable, but otherwise unremarkable. I'm giving them 2 instead of 3 stars because one (just 1 of 6) started unraveling around the top of the sock from the first day of use. No idea why, but it doesn't speak well for the workmanship or long-term durability. I wouldn't buy these again."
"The sandals are for my wife and she hate them , because they are too hard not confortable..."
I ordered 1 size larger than the bra I wear.  I had to add an extender to even get it around my body.  I offers ZERO support!  I looked like I was braless!  I am very unhappy with this product!
"Ordered XL large  coz I always think it's made for Asian petite but this one is stretchable I'm  138 lbs , 5'0 38D"
cups are larger than expected
Way to big and bulky. Do not like the way the hat ia made either.
I saw these gloves at Macy's and ordered them from Amazon for the right size. I thought that they would be great for a Chicago winter. Man was I wrong. These gloves don't keep my hands warm at all. I am so disappointed in these gloves that I have only worn them once and have stuck to my basic knit gloves I got for $5.
"Product arrived later than promised.  Color is off- ruffles are dark blue compared to picture.  The leg holes are way too big, very revealing.  I wish I would have seen the reviews before ordering!"
"The shoes fit well but is did not like the look of the product when I tried them on ""in-person"""
"I don't know what medium means anymore. According to the size chart and my 32"" waist, these should fit. These are nut huggers!"
"This bra was unattractive and uncomfortable to wear.  The material was cheap and scratchy, and the bra was both pointy and flat.  I had the same problem with another Glamorise bra.  I'll stick to Goddess in the future.  Seller was prompt and responsive."
"Looks way better on screen than in reality. I am lean and slum built, yet I ordered two sizes more. It still fits tight.

Cheap material."
"Did not like this at all, would not hold up the cups without causing uncomfortable pinching. I ultimately ended up returning this."
poor quality.. this brand went offshore  (can you say CHINA?)  this brand is garbage...
"I am 25. I thought these studs would be a cute pop to any outfit, but they look like they are for someone much younger. Also, the prongs that go through your ears are very, very short, and the backs fell off when I tried them on. I love Kate Spade products, but this wasn't for me. I'd recommend for kids with skinny earlobes!"
Got this for my wife during a lightning deal on Amazon. Shoulder strap broke where it connected to the bag after about a month and I was able to get it replaced. Wouldn't recommend this as it is cheaply made and based off the other reviews it seems to happen to most people that bought this.
"no grip bottom...very slippery...returned after i skidded walking on rough cement,which is contraintuitive!"
Too cumbersome
Not large enough and very flimsy leather. Not a very sturdy purse. Love the wallets though!
"This doesn't work so well. I have something similar (all silicone) from another company that I love. But this is shaped weird, sticks to EVERYTHING BUT BREASTS, the hard plastic cinching thing either has to poke into you or show through your clothing. The little spots that are for your nipples don't seem to be in the right place. I accidentally part of one touch part of the other one and it wouldn't come apart. When I was finally able to get them separated, it detached some of the sticky stuff from the cover. But when I put them on my breasts, as soon as I moved to get my shirt, it fell off! I was able to make it work with my tanks that have the built in bra, because it has elastic that can hold them in place if they don't stick right. I would not recommend this. Go for one of the ones that are all silicone. You're not allowed to mention other brands in reviews, so I can't tell you which ones really work well, but I can tell you, IT'S NOT THESE!"
had a hole in them in 2 hours!
Was disappointed how small they ran in size and that they had no give to them at all.  I had couple of people who normally wear  6.5 try them on and they did not fit anyone.
tight in the arms & chest - returned
Even with a larger size than needed it was too clingy
"This is a good looking pullover that fit my husband well.  He borders on large/extra large and the large fit.  However, as it's gone through several washings (in cold water) the color has faded a bit and the surface, especially around the waistband is covered with those tiny pills that cheap material develops after a few washings.

It is sufficiently ratty looking that I wish I hadn't bought it - but he still likes it anyway."
"Not at all the size it should have been and there is NO extender either, a total waste of my money!"
"Just say that a shoe is one color and the other pair of a different color!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great crap! I lost my money!
This review is for the product! not for Amazon!
OK!
Crap I HAVE BAD LUCK!
CATERPILLAR STINKS!"
Okay... not the best. I have used this bag only once and already see the wear in it.
"These beads turned ""coppery"" as soon as I put them on my bracelet.  it seems like a good deal, especially as a filler for Pandora style bracelets, however, this product was a big disappointment."
Awful fit. This bra is not comfortable at all.
This hat is WAY too big !  Don't get it!
I bought this for an 11 year old. Studs were falling off within weeks of wear. It was inexpensive so I can't complain too much and who knows how he was treating it.
too large I don't recomend it .!
"Pants fit perfectly. Top shrunk so belly always shows. Expected with Gerber that some shrink too much, but this is ridiculous."
"Just a shame to see the quality of Tevas continue to drop.  As an example, the toe strap is about 1.5"" shorter than my old Tevas (same model), making it necessary to keep the strap tighter than needed. Does it really save that much money to shorten?"
The heading for this scarf clearly indicates that it comes in a gift box. Mine just arrived in a ziplock bag!  I needed to simply wrap this and put it under the tree now I get to figure out how to get this presentable as a gift. It is not impressive in softness or texture either. I could forgive that because of the small price if it would have at least come in the described box. I may just send it back.
"Well made shoe for the price, but they did not fit my feet well.  The shoes were proper in length and width, however the opening was to large and the elastic band not tight enough to keep the shoes on my feet."
"I went off the reviews and size charting....I'm a size us 14/16 so I ordered the XXXL ...too small...I probably need a 6xl ...SMH.

But the outside was a nice leathery material and the inside is soft..."
"I have a pair of Orthaheel sandals that look much like these.  I believe that these new ones which are actually made by a new company, Vionic, are not nearly as good as the old ones made by the original Orthaheel company.  I returned these due to their poor quality.  They are more ""PLASTICY"" than my old ones.  They do not feel as good.  They seem ""cheap"" lightweight and flimsy compared to my old ones which seemed to have a more solid feel to them.  It's too bad that Vionic changed the ""recipe"" for a good shoe.  They are no longer good."
the sleeve fits wierd. not a good fit at all.material is nice .
"The website advertised UV protection but no where on the tag does it mention it is UV protected.  I have vitiligo and purposely purchased these shorts and the bottom for a trip I am taking soon.  I am worried that they are not really protected and were falsely advertising which could cause damage to my skin.  The top that matches says it is also UV protected on the website but once again on the tags to the products that arrived it does not.
If I am not able to verify that they are UV protected then I will be sending them back."
Material vet thin and poor quality
Very cheaply made!!!
wow how disappointed I am I in this product I feel like I wasted a lot of money when I could just put a quarter and a gumball machine to get the same product very poorly made and in shipment all of it tangled together it was one hot messI give any advice to anyone who would like to buy this it would be done unless you plan on wearing it for 1 hour just to watch it fall to the floor
"This scarf looks and feels like a cheap polyester satin scarf.  I checked the label several times to be sure it really is silk.

The colors are lovely and for about half the price, I'd be thrilled with it."
"These pants are terrible. im 5'10 almost 5'11 and ive never had a problem with pants till now. I ordered a M regular and i look like a worlds biggest loser contestant trying his old pants on. Im 175lbs athletic build and have a 30 waist. I had to order a M because of fact that their S is to small on me.  But its wayyy too much. Its extremely baggy on the pants sides. Its not tapered in the slightest. They look decent with knee pads on but without, they look gross."
"I wanted to like these, but they felt difference than the unisex OOFOS which I love so had to return them."
"This was a disappointing purchase. The only accurate discription of the RocSports Lite is that it is ""lite"" on quality. Sent it back the same day I received it."
"I THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY WHEN I RECIEVED IT, HOWEVER IT IS VERY THIN (CHEAP) AND AFTER ONE WEAR AND A WASH... ESSENTIALLY I WONT BE WEARING IT AGAIN! :("
"The design is lovely, but cup size and width were both way off. Ordered a 36C but was more like a 32A.  Cost too much to ship back so just threw it away."
"Thought it was too baggy, so I returned them and bought regular fit."
Much smaller than the ad states. Barely fit my pillow into it.
"Terrible. Everything is poor. Quality, fit, style, The logo is just a mess of stitching. It's acrylic but still feels like rough wool. I would return but as it was only $18 I can't imagine I will get around to it."
"I bought this during finals week, didn't use it because it looks poorly tailored, and now it's too late to return it. It's flimsy and impossible to press properly, yet heavy and uncomfortable."
"Super thin, got holes almost immediately and the zipper came off within two months. Wasn't what I came to expect from Dickies."
Really crappy material!
"I ended up getting a few in the different colors -  basically for the summer.  They are ok as pj bottoms now or to wear in a tai chi class.  Now I will have to wear them only in the house - as the temperature outside is too cold.  The wind would go right through them!!

The length of these pants was VERY long - and now I must add the cost whatever my tailor will charge me to shorten each one of them.  $10 at least.  If you can sew - then you are ahead of me.

When you examine them closely - you will notice the items are sewn adequately  - but very sloppy - and often you will find loose threads here and there.  - these are quickly assembled so don't expect precision seams or stitches.

They are definitely NOT top quality.  As I mentioned earlier - you can wear them to the gym and workout in them.

In the spring - I would think Walmart will put out better pants at the same or lower price."
The material used is not I am expecting.
"No zipper, poor quality stitching, cheap crinkly lining. Very very smelly. Just very poor quality. I don't recommend this in the least."
"These shoes were poorly made. The sole of the shoe is set a skew to the fabric walls of the wedge, making your foot to set off balance. I wear wedges a lot, so have to problem there.
They ""look"" great, so unless your planning on wearing them, these shoes aren't worth your money.
They were too big, and the sides of the toe sole were pointed out funny.....I think it had to do with the attachment of the fabric to the sole bad. There were a lot large clumps of dried shoe glue seeping out of outside seams."
"I keep repurchasing this bra because it works and it fits properly.  Love the blue color.

 It hurts me to have to edit this review because this means I have to find another sports bra for the gym this bra is good I guess if you're doing a lazy workout at the gym but since I started running and using this bra it creates friction where it takes the skin off on both sides of my breast at the top were the underwire begins and in the front in between my breasts which is very painful."
"I cannot believe that a shoe made in this pattern could be so uncomfortable. They are so narrow in the middle of this shoe that the goring was hard to slip my foot into the shoe.  And I have somewhat narrow feet!  If it had any padding in the shoe, I could not feel it.  A shame to make such a shoe and expect people to actually wear this?  I don't get it. I am usually positive in my reviews, but these are terrible. Sorry."
"Too tight in the bust, whisper thin....Really wanted some WARM long johns :("
This one is nothing as the picture. The dress isn't long enough it too short. It's disappointed. It's trusted a bit. Don't buy it.
Q&A twice suggested that 4xl would fit 36-38. These are more like a size 50!! Thanks for waisting my time! Q&A is useless! If they cant provide an accurate sizing chart. They don't deseve my business!
"Not the quality I expected:
1. It's too heavy(over 0.515 kg) for a 'puffer' coat.
2. The quality of the fabric is not there. It's not soft at all.
3. The infilling stuff obviously isn't feathers.
Can't return it, since the international shipping rate is too high."
"Ordered the sunset revo 3 pack and was expecting orange/yellow lenses like the photo. I didn't notice there was an individual one marked sunset revo also. Got my order and all 3 pairs are green and look nothing like the photo of orange/yellow. Someone in the questions asks which color is correct. Apparently, the green color is as mine didn't look orange at all. Pretty disappointed by the completely misleading photo."
I got the wrong size and color. It's too bad. It was a gift for my mom and I couldn't give it to her.
Broke after 2-3 weeks on the clasp that you use to breast feed. So dissapointed.
"Returning, too small to put on."
Don't buy it!!! It's ugly!!
"I ordered a wide boot, but they failed to consider the calves of women who wear wide boots would also be wide... fail."
"Perfect for my trip!
Well, back from my trip...changed my rating to 1 star. 2nd day in Scotland and the zipper on the bigger part came flying off. Needless to say this wasn't a great start, especially since I kept my wallet in there. Moved my wallet to next pocket and yep, zipper broke. So guess who bought a new bag in Scotland?!"
The packaging was horrible and the size chart was incorrect. Outfit was returned
"Not really a 3E wide shoe more like a standard wide, very cramped toe box."
These had absolutely no cushion in them and were like walking on plywood.  I returned them.  Cute looking but unless you add insoles very uncomfortable.
"Seems like a decent shoe, but too narrow for my feet. The length seemed fine, the leather was ok, not supple or soft however. Msy loosen with wear, but the barrow fit and stiff leather were a deal breaking combo."
"I wear a 12.5D so I went with the 12E.  The length and width of the boots fit well.  What ruins the boots is the tongue design.  The tongue is designed in such a way that when you place it over your foot, the leather will fold over creating three layers.  This became a problem when I cinched down on the laces because the multiple layers of the tongue had nowhere to go and would bunch up and fold in odd places creating painful pressure points.  You are unable to dictate where and how these folds will take place due to the way the pieces of the tongue are stitched together and how the inner lining of the boot is stitched to the tongue.  I leave an extra star because the materials used appear to be of good quality.  However, the flawed tongue design makes these boots unusable."
Drean city? What the heck?
I returned these shoes as they looked and felt very cheaply made. The back of the shoe barely covered the back of my leg. Did not like at all.
Very thin padding. Didn't feel strong enough so I sent it back.
Too much flowing fabric!  Not flattering below the waist but nice support on the top.
"I live the shoe, it is as described, but one side buckles the other side the strap cannot even reach."
The name sucks.
"Size is too small.
Have contacted seller for return label and they have not responded.
Their phone number is not working."
"Will never buy from this seller again.  This too short, and the material is very thin, and does not look like the picture. It seems to be a teen dress instead of a women's dress."
Broke the first time my son wore it
Had to return these because they were so tight.  I ordered the large but I doubt an xl would have allowed me to breathe
Way to snug. Too tight
Buttons broke off days after purchase.
"They seem to be cut different through the seat and are not as comfortable as earlier models. The lenghth is also a little shorter. Don't think I will buy these

 again."
Very tall and awkward to carry.
"Very small, more appropriate for a child or teen. Picture was misleading and I thought the piece would be larger. It's going back to Amazon."
Too big around the legs
"I read the reviews but ordered the size that I would normally wear, and much to my surprise everyone was right, the shoe runs very small. It comes up to high on the sides for me. I had to return this beautiful shoe.  I have the Jambu in the sandal and the fit is great. I guess I'll stick to the sandals, I really love to style and fit."
The size on this Levi's style runs small & the waist  is uncomfortable. Usually Levi's fit quite well but I have noticed that jeans assembled in Pakistan seem to not match the quality of those produced in Vietnam.
This shoe broke within 10 minutes of my toddler wearing it. :(
It's ashame because it's a cool jacket. I should have heeded the warning that it is way too small. If you are a medium you had better order an XL.
"Very cheaply made, zipper wouldn't work, came in a tiny box so they were all folded up.  When I tried to return it, seller asked if I would take a discount. I replied no, I'd like a full refund. I still haven't heard from them and its been over a week.  I might pay 5$ for these if I hadn't needed them asap and bought a different pair from Target for cheaper and doubles as rain boots too."
Item was way too small and I ordered an XL...I am 5'5 135lbs
"Cheap, came with one strap detached. Color is as pictured, but it's garbage."
The strap on the side rubs against my ankle and is too thick. The Velcro closure doesn't allow me to tighten the shoe as much as I would like.
I ordered these new and they came the wrong color and very used. They are scuffed up and stretched very large.  Not happy with this order at all since I needed these quick now I ha e to figure something out. Since I have to return and wait for the return to process to order again I don't have that much time.
The zipperbia broke. There is a hole in then outside fabric. The top trim did not catch all of the fabric under i . Very disappeared. Returned item
For 3XL size too short!
never wore them was very disappointment way too small
"Returened the product. Too small, not good quality of fabric, a little too stiff."
"I purchased these as a gift for my husband, as he is always looking for a nice standout ""statement"" shoe. The bold red color is definitely a win in this department, and they pair well with many different color pants/jeans. Unfortunately he has not had much success with New Balance shoes as a whole, given this is his third pair and he always encounters the same issues. The arch support is minimal, so expect to definitely buy inserts. The biggest issue is for whatever reason, his feet always end up sweating in New Balance after a few hours. He's compared to Adidas and Nike brand, and no other shoes seem to have the same issue for him. Perhaps New Balance has poor ventilation, but whatever the case, he claims that he is comfortable wearing them all day - however you'd definitely not want to wear these day after day, rather let them air out after each wear and give your feet a break."
"Very poor quality, tear at side, crumpled seam"
for some reason they fell apart in like 8 weeks
"This is a really small tube of moisturizer. It is only 1 ounce. And to sell it for about $50 I would expect it to do a lot more than just moisturize. After using is for a few weeks, I have to say I am not impressed. The lotion is lightweight, which I like. It also contains sunscreens, which I like. However, it did not really do anything noticeable for my dark spots. Therefore, I cannot justify the cost of continuing this after my Vine sample runs out."
"I'm not sure why people say these shoes run big.  They were a perfect fit.  I always wear a size 6, which is the size I ordered of these shoes.  They are super cute, but they rubbed against my toes and caused blisters.  I couldn't wait to take them off at the end of the day.  They are definitely not a shoe you would want to wear all day long.  I have tried a few times because I was hoping they would ""break in"".  They never did."
"I've always bought Istoner slippers in this size but a different style I just received these and they are too small. I won't bother to return them, but will give them to a friend who wears one size smaller than me."
Did not like the fit or material
TORE AT on the ass area!!!
"Poorly made, crooked stitches, does not fit. Don't waste your money."
"Not the best arch support ever, but these are still very comfortable shoes. I loved the look, but unfortunately I had to downgrade the product rating due to the heel breaking in less than 3 months after only wearing these shoes 1-2 times/wk to my desk job. I'm only 125 lbs, don't walk around much throughout my hectic workday at the office (and tend to trade out heels for my office flats on quieter days), and don't typically wear heels during ""off hours,"" so when I walked to my car this morning and felt the heel bend off, I was very disappointed. I really liked this pair of shoes and hoped that $25 would get me at least 8-12 months of wear."
I recived different color it was light pink.
I found these to difficult to put on.  I purchased another Keds product with a softer back. I did return these and Amazon was incredibly supportive.
Material is cheap and shirt does not fit as expected in the picture. Wasn't satisfied at all with my order.
Credit cards did not fit. Had to return this product.
Would have been 5 stars but earrings arrived broken.  One of the pearls was detached from the earring setting.  Will have to take to a jewelry store to have fixed.  Not good quality for the price.  Earrings are nice though.
It turns green within a week of wear
The quality of these sandals where HORRIBLE!  I BUY TIMBERLAND SANDALS EVERY YEAR FOR MY 3 SONS. FIRST TIME ORDERING THEM.... AND I WISH I DIDN'T!  MATERIAL FELT CHEAP! MUST OF BEEN KNOCK OFFS! DONT WANT YOUR MONEY....PLEASE!
"Cute shoe, material is somewhat cheap, but the fit is way to large. Go down a size!"
The back of the stone is a deep hollow and it hurts when I bend my finger. Thinking about returning it
I was very excited to order these at such a good price. Then when I opened the package the texture was gnarly. They are very uncomfortable.
"This pants size M, is very large, wear my mother who is size L in other garments, I could not use at large. the color is green. but this picture looks brown"
"Super soft & comfortable! I bought these for lounging around the house. I wanted something comfortable for after I got home from work & took my scrubs off. These are perfect! Very warm, too. Editing my review because while these were great before washing, they shrunk a lot after the first wash (and yes, I washed per the instructions). They were plenty long prior to washing & now are above my ankle. Very disappointing."
"I have several of the KavaJ products and love them!! iphone... ipad.  However, I don't like this wallet. In my opinion, the snap with strap makes this too thick, and is a pressure point when you sit on it.  I regret buying it.  If they would just make a small folding wallet for 6 cards without a strap, I would buy that because I like the KavaJ quality."
"The size 8 Mens was at least 1 size, maybe 2 sizes too large.  Product quality is a fine value, just too big."
This music box arrived broken and made very poorly.  My husband who can fix almost anything said it was beyond repair and constructed so poorly it would break again.  It wasn't even worth the effort to try to fix or box up and send back.  It ended up in the trash.
Nice hat but it is way too small. Took it to a western wear store and had it professionally steam streched. No go. Guess my kid gets this one.
"I purchased this as this was the only larger size minion costume for women. The fit was a little snug at the hip and way too lose in the upper body. The material is okay. Nothing special. It has a velcro clasp in the back versus a zipper. It's a thin material. I didn't like the fact that the costume's ""skirt"" part of the dress flares at the hips instead of the waste. It accentuates the wrong area. I wish the flare part of the dress was higher. Or it would just be better without any flare. The packaging was damaged. The bag was already ripped at the bottom and it wasn't put together very nicely. I returned my purchase because of the large sizing and my dislike for the flare part of the dress."
Hips way too small and waist way too big. This skirt is made all wrong. Even though I ordered a size bigger. Don't bother buying.
I received this bag yesterday and did not like the way it was package. It was received in a envelope type package. The fold is still in the back. The color was ok but will not buy again. They need to come up with a new packing method.
Are too big.  There is way too much material in the stomach area and they are by no means straight leg.  They're on their way back. I am undecided if I'll try a smaller size.
"to the negative reviews.  This didn't work -- the little turn gear to adjust the width between the hooks just turns away and the hooks stay where they are.  Was the low price just too good to be true -- well, yes, because the tool doesn't even function so you can't tell if it would work."
Too small- extremely poor quality.
I purchased for a christmas present and it was WAY to small for the size I purchased. I even ordered a size bigger (M) and it seemed like a child's medium.
"I ordered a size smaller.  There's too much room still in the toe.  Feels like wearing clown shoes.  The tip gets pointy, so it squishes the toes."
"It is a beautiful earrings, looks much more expensive than payed for.  Central stone is deep ocean blue and see through a little bit in the middle.

Update: all my life I have been wearing everything, but not this earrings! Terrible contact reaction!!! Do not buy this, it's just dangerous."
NOT as pictured! Doesn't have a strap so I had to send them back. So frustrated!
The shirt sags in the front like a kangaroo pouch. Looks awful.
super see through and baggy
"The skirt is pretty short, the material is decently heavy, but I most likely wouldn't buy again."
"Complete waste of money. The sizing is totally off. Ordered a 9.5, and my son is a 9, and they still were too small. Compared that shoe to a size 8 shoe he has and they were literally a cm in difference. So basically I just gave these people my money for nothing!"
The button was broken off when I opened the package and one of the holes ripped when I pulled them up. But other than that they fit fine and are very comfy.
"Too narrow in the toe box, and I have small narrow feet, the outer portion on the heel hit my ankle bone.  Very painful to even attempt to try on.  Cute shoe, but not worth the pain."
"No fault of the bra but these were not for me. I'm used to lined bras which provide additional support and shape. This bra does neither. These are shaped and scaled for much bigger breasts and full coverage, not a good fit or look for me with 34B."
"I had to return these because one of the snaps on the strap at the top was missing.  The shaft was also too tight to wear skinny jeans tucked in.  Too bad, because they were attractive."
"Sewn labels date product as pre-2014  manufacture date. Have no clue how old elastic is. I'll donate $57 worth of briefs and buy another brand for first time since 1950. 67 years of loyalty spoiled because somebody had to search a warehouse in China for my size (40 waist), and it took 23 days to deliver the order. I might as well live in Nome and weigh 400 lbs!"
Have to get used to the flatter support.
These jeans were way too long as you can kinda already even see in the pic.  On top of that they didn't last at all making it maybe 5 months.  Wore them very little because I just wasn't a huge fan and even then they fell apart pretty quickly.
"I normally wear a normal 7 in all my shoes.  This pair came super fast, which is excellent, however; the low rating is due to the sizing.  They are completely off.  I wish I didn't have to take the time to return them and package them up and send to UPS, but such is life.  So, I returned and went to Rack Room Shoes in my town and found a pair identical that I got the second pair 1/2 off... and they fit.  So.. poor sizing is reason the low rate."
"They look like the picture. However, I bought one size up and they were very tight. I would recommend them as long as you're not a 9 & 1/2 needing a 10."
"i always read the reviews of a product. last couple of items i purchased were totally the opposite. good cotton underwear, but legs too short. they curl up and have no shape at all. be carefull, everything will fall out. i do not recommend!"
Wore out quickly; not a good buy for the money. Disappointed..
The top of my he boot is way to small also the boot is to narrow.
Way too long and way too short  around the stomach and  I am not a big guy buy something from quicksilver
this is very see through. thin material. don't recommend
The poor  quality of the dress .
"I thought this looked cute so I ordered it in XL, based on several reviews that said this garment
was sized much too small, and to order a larger size.  I did just that, and, quite honestly, could
have ordered it in a medium and it would have fit better.  As it is, I'll just use it to wear around
the house or to do yard work."
"OK, here's my dilemma, I can't be alone on this size issue I am facing. I wear a 16-18 in tops and apparently have a wide back with a B cup size. My problem is I need a large band but a small cup. I ordered a 48B with high hopes. I continue to find the cup size on bras goes up proportionately to the band size, so when I order a B cup with a wide band I get anything from a C to a DD in cup size which will simply not work for us B cup gals. This bra was no exception. The B cup fit like a C or D and had a lot of pucker at the top of the cup on my frame. I have attuned to there being a large and underserved population of women who are plus size but don't have large breasts who seem relegated to sports bras as there are literally no bras manufactured to fit these proportions. How is it possible that if the average woman in this country is a 16-18, that there are so few bras with small cups? This bra almost worked. I do love the front clasp, but with so much pucker at the top of the cup, back it goes. Does anyone have any recommendations for a 44 or 46 B bra that is also pretty?"
"poorly made (part of shoe was not sewn closed), was completely different than pictured, coated in plastic, uncomfortable to wear. Returned. The return process was so great."
i thought it would be flexible but it was exactly the opposite.  it's rock hard.
These did not fit when they arrived.  I did not order another pair because I thought they looked like they were cheap.  Too bad because I really did like the heel and wish there were more stylish heels around instead of HIGH heels around.
"Men's low rise brief!!!! A gross misrepresentation for "" low rise"" ----much too long in body----regular rise undoubtedly would come up past your nipples. grossly disappointed----fallacy of on line buying, time consuming and waste of money trying to find underwear that fit my need!"
I should have returned them.  Why can't ballet flats have some support?  They ran so small I couldn't wear them.
"I purchased this in navy and was disappointed to find that it faded rapidly (even though washed inside out, with Woolite for Darks in cold water, and dried on cool. I noticed the dramatic fading after just a month of wear. The neck has started to pucker too. The threads are still the original navy color. The rest of the garment is now a reddish purple rather than navy.

As for fit, the sleeves are too long for me (and I am tall and usually never have this problem). The thumb holes would be great if I wasn't using this under scrubs at a hospital. I have to wash/sanitize too much to even think about engaging the thumb holes.

It looks like other reviewers had better luck. Maybe the other colors are more stable.

I love my Cherokee Infinity jacket, mock-wrap top, and tall cargo pants ---all in navy. They are holding up well, and I would buy those again. I have washed them along with the t-shirts ---and more often than the t-shirts ---and they still look brand new after about a month and a half."
The pair I got had differently sized left and right shoes. The right shoe fit perfect but the left was so small I had to return it. Maybe I got a defective pair? Usually love Seychelles shoes so going to order another pair.
Bra arrived with a nice crease down the cups so I immediately threw it in the washer. Smells soooooo musty I've washed four timeS but still musty. Also straps don't have much elastic. Also the crease appears to be in the same place. Color was nice.
"I have not worn these, I would return them, but they were so cheap, the return doesn't seem worth my time.  I have given these to good-will without wearing them once.  I put them on in my apartment and realized I could see my underwear through them.  Maybe wearing dark underwear would be ok, maybe the thin material would be good in summer.  This is not something I would ever wear.  I think I will keep my work pants purchases to JCPennys, where I can try on and easily return."
"My other pairs fit great, only  these were too small... bummer"
"Cannot recommend these earrings to anyone with sensitive ears. Usually, I am fine wearing stainless steel earrings, but within a few hours of wearing the silver pair, my ears were feeling sore and itchy. Plan to give away the other two pairs to someone with less skin issues as I didn't bother to try them on. Shame, they were cute."
I could tell that cheaper materials were used in this pair as the comfortibility is lacking compared to last pair. Would not buy again.
"Returning these. The fit is very wide at the top and the strap doesn't adjust much.  The spikes on the bottom aren't spaced properly, so you can feel them through the shoes when walking.  Need another spike at the top by the toes to make it even. Otherwise, they would be comfortable and lightweight and the price is great."
"I have to admit, I do not own this shoe bag or any other. I wanted to, but I couldn't stomach the price. So, after considering several options and even possibly making my own, I decided to go with something even easier: bread bags! I started saving empty bread bags for my husband's dress shoes, which we store upright in a fabric bin (with split-toe cedar shoe trees in each shoe--a must for extending the life of any men's leather dress shoe). Bread bags work great! They are free (as long as you regularly buy bread), and even my husband's size 13-14 dress shoes fit in them. So, if you're on the fence about purchasing travel shoe bags and you don't need them right away, consider saving your bread bags as shoe bags instead."
The review was the same as the other gowns.
"These are gorgeous real leather boots that are waterproof. Wore them on our first snowy wet day and they kept my feet dry. They are rather stiff but nice thick leather.  I first ordered them in a 7.5 my normal size and had to return them for the 8. I have a normal foot so I was surprised. The new ones in the 8 are a bit snug in the toe I love them they are gorgeous.

UPDATE: I have tried breaking these in, but after wearing them 8 hours on 3 different days, the foot pain was unbearable. I do not suffer from foot pain! My legs and back ached yesterday too. I am very sad because these are just gorgeous boots but I can't wear them."
Gave it to goodwill just too small
As other reviews say this hat is very tall. I am 6'5 and still this hat make me looks 6'9.  It does not wear well as it starts to fade and turn brown.
Went with 8 because they did not have an 8.5..too small. The 9 last year was too big. You need to offer half sizes. I feel like the costumes are made to fit Chinese women not cury American girls....
Got this just today. The item was not as new as described and as expected. The leather was a little faded and there was a blue ink stain on its fabric. I called Amazon immediately. They said that the item sent to me could be the last color pair. I also don't feel the tightness on my feet for a new shoes when I tried it. There was also a certain smell. Amazon is currently helping me to get my refund.
Knock offs!!! Price is outrageous for the quality!
Material too light
"These run about a size smaller than what I expected. And like everybody else, what you see aren't the patterns or colors you get...granted I like what I got, but can't wear them because they are small. :/"
clasp keeps coming undone.
Most uncomfortable sandal I've ever worn. Glad I only paid $10.
"A terrible design, I only wear Vionic shoes and this is not up to their standards at all. The entire foot base didn't line up with my feet, I had to return them. Don't waste your time or money, instead go for the ""Tide Style"" of sandal that Vionic makes instead--They are amazing and last for years with total comfort and great support."
This shirt was way to small it was the size of a child's large.
"I'm not returning this, but I will try to sell it to someone else because Its not really looking like that picture either, the shape is a little off. I don't know, I sort of hate the spandex texture too."
This is not what I expected. The hat was too small (childlike size). The material was not of a good quality. I returned.
Bad size too large compared to other merrell 10 size boots I have. Pay attention if you are going to buy this boots may be they are bigger that others merrell 10 size
"Can't use, not well made"
NOT THE COLORS ADVERTISED!!!!!
"I would not recommend this tool kit , it was cheaply put togeather and the plyers broke the first time I gripped one pin."
"Very small with no lobster claw, just a hoop. The picture looks like there is some gem or stone but mine came with none.  It was just a very tiny metal snow flake that is detailed but not what the picture looks like."
"I returned this sweater for two reasons: it runs really small, and the neck collar was loose."
"Update: Wore this dress exactly one time. Front zipper is a total loss. Just ordered another. May just return without taking a chance. Color is much, much darker than shown. Navy not blue like picture. Fit could be too tight for most."
"I gave two stars because this fit is my favorite. I'm 5'10 and wear a 31, they are perfect. I have a booty and tiny  waist, no gapping.

However the color is nothing like what was pictured   I bough a washed out color and got the darkest indigo blue. So no the picture isn't at all true to color..."
"Not flattering. It's quality but the color against my fair skin made me look washed out and bald on my forehead. Still, it's a very nice hat."
It was broken when I got it.  Its made of really cheap material.  Not worth it.  Such a dissapointment to me
"Bought this for my daughter to wear in a school play. The inner ""string"" scratched her skin and she left feathers every where she walked. It shed terribly. Although the feathers were very soft and it was a great length."
Doesn't look anything like the pictures it looks and feels like cheap dress up  necklace. I'm returning it.
"This costume is supposed to be a beer keg costume with a functioning spout, that was most of the reason I ordered it. However, the spout is soooo leaky, even when you are not using it, that my husband ended up just taking off the entire head piece, which made it not nearly as fun of a costume."
Too tight in toe box and loose in heel. Not stable to walk on..I am so disappointed because I have a black pair I bought 3 or 4 years ago and I love them and was hoping to get new colors.
Fit very large and long
irritated my shoulders even more than my bra straps.
Much too large and cumbersome looking
"These suck big time. The are way too narrow, plus I can't walk in them without the heel part coming off my feet."
"The cuffs are long and it fits snug, especially if you are a D cup!"
The green you see is nowhere near the color you get. The green is a lime green color. Not for my taste. Lime green is a color for a play place party not a formal event.
"Fit well, but the band on top was painful when I walked."
"Too thin, very cheap. Too expensive for lightweight plastic raincoat. Sent back."
"Ad says big boys socks but they are for toddlers, wasted money."
Cheap! Sent it back!
These shirts are poorly made and run EXTREMELY small. I wear a 2xl and I ordered the 4xl yet still couldn't even get it over my chest.
"As many customers have already said, these gloves are not -40 degree gloves. I live in the northern portion of the Texas panhandle and my finger tips were cold with zero degree windchill.

The gloves are bigger than advertised, but seem made and comfortable. You could use these gloves for light-medium duty lawn and house work. If you added some glove inserts or glove liners these gloves could be used for skiing in higher altitude and colder conditions, but I wouldn't ski with these gloves unless it was a warmer day. I'll keep the gloves, but I'll need to use liners on cold days.

EDIT: I've been trying to return these gloves because they are not keeping my hands warm below 30 degrees. The seller is requesting that I pay for return shipping despite the claims that these will keep your hands warm to -40 degrees. I've contacted Amazon and I'm trying to get the issue resolved but I fear that I'm out $13 while these gloves keep getting sold."
Not comfortable and I the band isn't wide enough to contain under boob.
"Hate these socks, we have passed these socks down to three people in our family.  Everyone hates the seams in the toe, they're huge.  We aren't generally people that have problems with the seams in socks.  These are destined for the trash."
A joke calling this anything but a strip of fabric.
Very short on arms
"The medium width seems more like a 'C' width than a 'D'. Very narrow.

It's a good shoe though, Just wore out a pair in correct size (13 EE) for me.
Surprisingly good arch support.
Sole rubber quality is durable. Got 5 years out of them.
Wish they weren't phasing out the Propet lines but can't find popular sizes anymore."
"I normally wear a 6.5, so thats what I ordered these shoes were so tight and uncomfortable, definatly not worth the price. But if you are going to order them, make sure you get a half size or full size larger than normal."
They fit well but the sole fell off in the middle of my work day after only 2 months of wear. Very disappointed.
It runs too large.
Didn't like it. Surprised by the wonderful reviews. Looks cheap and weird fitting.
"If there's negative rating, I have no doubt to pick it right away. Now I am in hospital writing this review is all because of this shoes. I got my cellulitius infection on my both legs around ankle area. I have to stay in hospital having IV antibiotic at the moment.
Poor design plus poor quality (the leather is properly disinfected) and high cost on my medical treatment. Please don't buy it as I don't want you guys gone through the nightmare like I am having now."
Picture of bracelet grossly misleading
I don't know what i got but they r not leather....i have 5 pairs of Pumas in my closet and they are leather but what i recieved from this company was what they advertise as PU LEATHER.....its fake and im ticked but u get what u pay for.....i thought i was getting a new pair of bad ass  LEATHER Pumas and thats not what I got.....
Way too small.  Material is really thin.  Cute but wouldn't order another one.
"If you admire quality, these are not for you. I had intended for these to be a gift. Thankfully, I did not give these to someone sight unseen; THAT would have been embarrassing. Returned immediately upon inspection. There is nothing good I can say about these.
The metal was super thin and cheap looking (as in, my Heavy Duty aluminum foil is more attractive & resilient). The ones I received were bulky/clunky and didn't look good on the ear due; drooping due to backing placement and design. Nowhere near as attractive or as sparkly as depicted or expected; the metal and gemstones offered little in the way of luster and sparkle."
Runs very small. Quality isn't great. Disappointed.
"I have very curly hair with a fair amount of volume, this wig covers about half of my head. It is a pretty shade of pink, identical to the picture but big hair beware!"
I won't buy this bra again.
Way to large and definitely cheaply made but wouldnt expect more for shoes that cost 10 bucks
"This is such a soft and comfortable bra, it feels great on. But even just walking on the treadmill, I was bouncing all over the place. I'm a 42D and it felt too large in the band so I ordered a 40D and while tighter, it still provided no support. Disappointed because it feels and looks very nice. I'm sending these back."
"I originally loved these -- I live at the beach and love beach pants.  These were great...until I washed them. The material shrank -- the pants were down right at my ankle with room to spare but when I washed them, they shrank in length about 4 inches total.  If you decide to buy them, NEVER EVER wash them."
Poor quality and at least two sizes too big. Sent it back.
Returned these boots right away! Couldn't even get my foot inside of them! :/
very thin and VERY small
"The size was right (bought a small, 5""2, 120 lbs) but the material and buttons were wrong. Both the buttons as well as the button holes had a lot of loose and frayed strings which made buttoning the shirt a bigger task than it should be. The material was really thin and flimsy. Not to mention the color sticks up VERY tall from the shoulders, it looks very awkward. All in all, I wasn't happy with it."
"Giant, giant, giant tights."
very poor product. The graphics were horrible three 3x was more like an XL. The shirt was very thin and cheap and shorter than most.
I was very disappointed at how thin & flimsy the material is.
Too small not good material or  Quality
"The dress was adorable, but the top fit very small.  I wear a 12-14 and 36d bra and the buttons barely closed over my chest, and it was so tight on my upper arms.  I really liked the print and style a lot.  If it was just tight in the chest, I considered wearing a lacy cami with it and leaving it slightly open, but the arms were too tight to be comfortable.  Sadly, I sent it back, but if I ever see it in a larger size or hear that the bodice design has been altered, I would try it again.  5 stars on appearance, 1 star on fit."
"Dismal quality, very disappointed in Tie Bar.  I have bought numerous ties and pocket squares from Tie Bar, all of which were of exceptional quality, which is why I did very little further research or exploring when I saw this one on their page.  It came out to almost $17.00 with shipping, which is way too much for a pocket square, but again, was expecting Tie Bar quality and wanted this particular color to match my light blue ties, so decided to spring for it to complete the pocket square collection.

I don't even know how to describe it, it does not hold its shape, does not fold, and it looks so cheap and poorly constructed that I am afraid if someone actually needs a handkerchief that I won't want to take it out of my pocket for them.

""Hand rolled edges""?!?  Um, how about limp, flat, thread visible hems. Seriously, terrible.  Tie Bar should remove from their store, brings the whole brand down more than a few pegs."
These clips tarnished within dais of wear and did  not stay on my bracelet. Spend a little more and go with Pandora brand.
I was disappointed the fit could not be accounted for by washing in very hot water.  32 inch purported waist size was more like 33+.
"very very large shoes, and they should fit because the other crocs i tried were too small. each design of croc shoes have different sizes. each fit me extremely different."
I would like 2 get the right size. But I don't have the invoice. With me not in the store.. Well some don't fit right..
loved it when I got it but the band has already broken 2 days after the return warranty ended
"Bad quality, color is not as pictured, losing hair. Returned."
Great price - but way too thin and poor design. Looked terrible so assume it won't hold up after many washes. Kept the Hanes similar style. Ordered s for thin but taller 6yr old boy
"gave it away, was too big"
This bra does not lift you or give you that look you want in your clothes. It smashes you in and makes you look like your breast are down around your stomach area. I brought 8 or 9 of them and wish I hadnt. Only good for wearing around the house because it really has no support or lift effect like a bra should.
It BRIGHT yellow - much brighter than what is shown. I don't really want to have my important papers in it while abroad.
Just not for me!
"Needs to have an ear size. I had to mold the dragon to fit my ear, but I can't mold it enough for it not to hurt by bending me ear. Now someone with tiny ears this would be great. Holding it in your hand, it looks so detailed, so pretty. If you have the patience to work with it to for your ear you should buy this."
"It was to small, But If it was the right size It would of, worked for me!"
"Looks really cheap, had to return it."
38 DD and they just keep a jigglin. You definitely will need to wear another sports bra on top to prevent movement. I was hoping to finally find a sports bra that does all the work on its own. This wasn't it- still rockin' 2-3 bras when doing rigorous activities to prevent giving myself a black eye. If anyone reading this has suggestions for one amazing sports bra please do share. It's the right thing to do.
Bad quality product...
Too big for my wife's wrist.  Tried it on for the heck of it.  Too small for mine.  Can't win.  Probably better for medium sized people.
"I really, really, really hate these shoes.  They fit fine but they are very cheaply made and they are UGLY!!!"
"Shoe was damaged,had to return. Sorry I didn't get a good pair, I really loved them."
"Color as advertised, size appropriate.....but VERY POOR construction.  No hem to sleeves or bottom of shirt, just a raggedy edge.  Flimsy material as well."
"Rubbed a blister on my right heel.  The Cohesion 7 never had a problem, but these aren't as good."
"These look okay for canvas shoes, but both FILA or Converse are better in my opinion.  These have very thin soles, similar to the $10 generic canvas shoes you can get at Target or KMart, and the edges around the ankles rub and chafe unless you have socks that go over the top of the shoe. They also squeak a lot but surprisingly have very little traction.

They are also TOO SMALL. I wear a 7 in every other brand of tennis or canvas shoe, but this one left blisters on the outside of my toes from being too tight and rubbing (I have narrow feet, too, and B(M) has always fit perfectly, so it's not a width issue). I'm pissed because I actually bought two pairs both in size 7 thinking they were a good deal, and wore one of them for a while thinking they would ""break-in"", but they never did. I tried wetting them and stretching/stuffing them, to no avail. Just missed the Amazon refund window, and now I'm left with one brand new and one barely-worn pairs of Keds that I guess are going on eBay.

I would recommend getting a FILA, or dropping another $15 and getting a pair of Converses. Or, just go to any department store and get their cheap canvas shoes for less. Do not recommend."
tighter in the waist then I expected
"I am desperately seeking a pair of brown ankle boots to wear to work and thought the Rockport Ordella would be perfect.  Sadly I am returning them and my quest continues.  The leather has a weird finish that makes it look cheap (and these were not inexpensive!).  I also need a dark, neutral brown color, but the brown shade has too much warmth/red in it.  And the decorative strap/wrap looks cute in the picture, but not so much in real life.  The 6 is a wee bit snug, if I was keeping them I would probably exchange for a 6.5."
"Trusting that these earrings were truly 14k, I ordered them for my 1 year old.  Within a week, not even sure it was a full 7 days, her left ear became very red and sore.  I had to remove the earring. I am afraid her hole will close before it heals enough to put new earrings in.  I would suggest spending your money at a local jewelry store.  You will know what you are getting that way."
"The actual length of the sandal is just right for my foot (I'm a size 12 1/2, so the 12/13 size is perfect for me. However, the strap part of the sandal is WAY TOO LOOSE. The sandals literally fall off my feet. I'm returning these. Not good at all."
"perfect heel height but ankle straps cut into me. Also, felt like I was stomping around when I walked even though they are light. Very disappointed. sent back. Size half a size down, run a bit big."
Gave my 8 yr old an atomic wedgie and made her look like she was a fly girl on In Living Color.
"I Ordered a size large , and this thing fits like a size small. I wanted to like it. Just didn't work for me. Very dissapointed. I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review"
Very thin and flimsy! Also the bangle came Broken.
I sent them back as they are more like swim trunks than shorts!
"The size is smaller than it should be, and it is VERY bulky!"
It was okay - pretty cheaply made but looked acceptible and the price is cheap so you get what you pay for
"I was so excited for this headband, but it does not hug my head, and it does not control my hair well. I have very fine hair and hate having it in my face, so this looked like a pretty and practical solution, but it's actually managed to fail me on both fronts: it doesn't look good because it sticks up straight over the top of my head (in other words, it doesn't curve down to hug the curve of my head), and it doesn't do a particularly good job of keeping the flyaway hair out of my face."
"Very poor quality, but I didn't pay much for it.  Not worth the hassle to return it, as the complany wants photos, etcetera. In this case, it's not worth saving a couple bucks....go to the dollar store instead."
"I love the Olga bra 35056 38 C without the padding. When I ordered the product  , I thought I was getting this particular bra but I didn't."
I bought these for a 7mos old in a size fit for a 6 mos old. They were extremely too BIG!  The boots fit the length of my palm not a baby's foot. I will def send these back for a smaller size.
Did not like it. Not a comfortable fit. Seller was good.  Fast shipping. Just did not like the item.
"I was SO excited about this dress. The photo is so pretty.  I carefully measured and ordered according to the size chart and then anxiously awaited the arrival of this dress.  It arrives in a clear cello bag with no labeling- just a folded up dress in a bag.  I open it up and first notice it is a slick, poly/nylon/spandex type of fabric making that zzzzppp type of sound every time it moves.  First let down.  So I unfold it and give it a shake out and I think- how in the world is this going to fit? But, hey, I did the measuring to their chart and it's stretchy so I'll give it a try.  Oh my.  It reminds me of a poorly fitting scuba suit.  The waist (which is a very thick seam) is a good four inches above the waist of a human body leaving this thick snake cutting across my midriff. Could work if you are VERY short waisted or plan on wearing a 6 inch wide belt with it.  I do have to say the stitching appears to be fairly well done and the zipper works fairly well with only a bit of sticking (normal for a disappearing zipper).  The skirt is no where as full as it appears- even if you put a crinoline under it.  Maybe half of what is appears like in the photo.  This dress is so very disappointing.  The last dress I ordered on Amazon was also a 50's style dress and it was gorgeous. This one was a bust :(  I've returned it. I will not be ordering from this company again.

 I hope this was helpful to someone."
"I actually really liked the features of this bag, but the zippers were poor quality and one arrived broken.  I returned and got a pretty purple Samsonite that is much better."
I went hiking with these shoes and it totally cut up my pinky toe super bad they are too stiff at the toe part and sharp. Tossed them after that.
Sizing is not the issue. The top fits awesome. Would buy the top again. . . The bottom ms fit too. The bottoms do nothing for the figure of someone who has had multiple kids. The bottoms are sewn in such a way that anyone without stone hard abs would have a pooch. . . Tankinis should cover and shape. . . NOT add bulges.
I received a display pair of these boots.  The right boots was worn from being tried on too many times.  Had to return since I expected two new boots.
"2 buttons popped off as soon as he tried it on. Poor quality, but the item does look as pictured."
"These shoes fit great and were comfortable, but unfortunately they were cheaply made and glued together! smh. I would not recommend!"
I gave it 1 star because the jewelry is nice but I don't believe to be Authentic with out a signature gift box. Came in a plastic rapper with cloth pouch. Very disappointed.
"was a gift,  did not like it.  Pretty sure its a good sneaker but this person needed something different for their feet.  It is a good brand."
"I have another similar watch case of a different brand I purchased some time ago. I needed another one, but because they were out of stock I ended up purchasing this one.

First, the locking mechanism does not work properly. When you close the lid the l8ck does not engage properly. You have to slam it shut or wiggle the lid vigourously until the locking mechanism engages. This does not happen with my other watch case,

There is a very tight fit with the watch cushions. Also, the dividers are too lowm so one watch touches the watch next to it.

The ""glass"" is actually plastic. That would not have been a problem had there been no logo on it.

I hate the hassle of returning things; usually at this price point I would just throw it away. However, I am sick of getting sent deffective trash. If I have to be inconvenienced, so will the vendor for sending me garbage."
Product came apart quickly.
"I love the looks of this bag and all the pockets/zippers and the colors are spot on,  but that's where it ends. There is no shape to the bag at all.  The inside divider between pockets is useless,it either folds in on top of everything or lays in the bottom dividing nothing. If you put anything with the slightest bit of weight (even a large wallet) in it,then using the carry handles..the bag has a shape like a used plastic grocery sack. I would not recommend this bag/style to anyone.  It has no shape or substance to it all.  Its too late to return it..so now i'm stuck, as it was a Christmas gift, it was purchased to early.  What a waste of money."
"bad quality... doesnt look like the one on the picture...
its like plastic..."
"These run so big, but keen quality is good ."
"These shoes are a little tight in the back of the heel where it scrunches. After wearing for a couple of hours, the rubbing starts to hurt and rub raw. It's a cute shoe, but the fit is a tad tight and ordering a size up would definitely be too big. Also, somewhat cheap looking."
"The way the bra looks in the picture is not how the bra fits you.  When I 1st put it on, I thought it might be a good bra but this is the 2nd bra I order through Amazon and they both seperate your breasts but in an unattractive way. If you're looking for cleavage, this is NOT the bra!!  It does minimize your breasts but not a very good shaping bra.

Would not recommend.  On a positive note, I rated 2 stars because the material feels nice (but doesn't make up for how bad of a bra it is)."
"This bra is disappointing. The inside of the bra is designed almost like a wrap shirt or dress, the left side holds up fine for low impact activities, but the right side offers almost no support at all. I will continue on my search for a functional, low-cut sports bra."
"Very large, will only fit a L or XL head."
"the strap that holds the top part to the sole is not actually attached by leather. the leather covers a thin cotton lace that's sewn to the sole, but the leather itself isn't attached. also they are quite heavy, returned these and still looking for a pair with better quality"
"SO I was REALLY excited that these leggings arrived early and in time for my trip to Universal to visit the new Hogwarts area. then I noticed a small stain on them. They were cheap enough that sending them back would be more of a hassle that it is worth sop I figured I could just get the stain out with stain remover and be happy. Nope. Its dye. or something permanent. I'm seriously upset about this but oh well, you get what you pay for.
Also- they're EXTREMELY sheer."
I ordered a green in Medium. The color and fit were great but it was a completely different dress. 
you get what you pay for......turned copper
I love pumas but these are terrible my eye loop broke almost right away. I didn't want to give a bad review because I love pumas but after reading everyone's reviews I thought it best to tell people this has to be some sort of defect! Please fix this issue before selling another pair to someone else!!
larger than i thought. reminds me more of a cat than a fox.sorry i got it . i will be giving it away.
Despite other reviews this fits very fitted! I'm a size 10 and the x large was so snug!
for the price it is okay but looks very plastic. will not buy again. But size and lining with compartments is nice
A little too big. I would like to return it but my daughter took the tag off and threw it away so I have no choice but to keep it. I will not recommend
"Quality is suspect. I wore the first pair the other day and noted at the end of the day what appears to be a hole or run in the upper leg part of the sock. May be perhaps a defect on just this one sock, but surprising consider it is a Docker's sock. I'll update this when I wear a different pair from the same package to see if it is a one-off issue or if the socks quality overall is poor."
I bought this to keep track of all my travel reservations - everything that i needed to print out before.  My plan was to print out 8.5x11 and fold it in thirds.  Doesn't fit.  I guess the pockets on the left were supposed to be specifically for passports because they do not run the length of the wallet.  I don't know what would fit in the longest pocket on the right(pencils?)  It isn't wide enought to even fit boarding passes.  The zipper on the right (inside) is in an awkward place. The handle is attached with a flimsy D ring to the zipper.  I  specially wanted a handle not attached to the zipper.  I couldn't really tell from the picture but that turned out to not be a big deal because I didn't even use it.
"I bought the correct size, and it was way too tight.  I don't know how that's possible but it was, so I returned it."
"Its ok but it def rides down
If ur 4'11 and a size 8-6 I would get a size small. The Med was too small"
"I ordered this two sizes larger than need -be. It was still too small. :( These sizes are soooooo tiny! I also thought the hood was like with fur but it's just the neck. I'm disappointed. Not sure if its too late too return as it was a christmas gift but I am going to attempt to return it.

Update:
After Attempting to return this.... they wanted ME to pay the return shipping! Nope... not happening. So this was a waste of money. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this tiny vest."
"It's too noisy when you walks and runs small. I have two another reef flip flops which are great, so I think this model is flawed."
"I ordered a size 9 and they sent me size 9/2X!!!  When I ordered, it said nothing about 2X or plus size.  I am sending these back for a refund and I don't think I am going to order underwear again on amazon.  I think I might go and checkout Herroom and Freshpair websites.  Good Luck!"
"A serious ""eh"" from me.

It says ""cross body"", but unless you are smaller than a size 12 it's uncomfortable to wear. I bought these to be a gift to my sister and her bestie, but neither one of them are teenie-tiny gals. I am returning them both."
I bought a size up because so many reviews said it was on the small side.. No. Its fairly large! And the length is way longer than it looks in the pic. Its fairly boxy and shows no curves. Maybe a size or two smaller would have. Buy your actual size or even a size smaller. I don't like it at all. No shape wahtsoever and so long. My son said I look like a school teacher. So much for a eloquent sexy dress for date night!
"Badly made from Chine, the colours were all wrong. Better buying hunter"
"I tried this shoe for a while but it was just not comfortable.  The size was fine, but it seemed to ""grab"" my foot, especially at the top.  No matter how I adjusted the shoe, it didn't help.  I even tried to wear socks (which would have defeated the purpose of buying this particular shoe), but it still was uncomfortable.  I ended up sending them back."
Horrible dress. It's nicer on the model then it is in person.  Cheaply made and not comfortable
They were short and way to wide. My boy coudn't wear them because he is a bit tinny and at the same time they were short .. so I coudn't even keep them for later ... had to give them away.
"The buckle is thin, malleable plastic that falls apart.
I returned it.
Amazon graciously issued me an immediate credit.
Nothing else needs saying."
"I've been wearing these boots with some frequency (not daily) over the past month or so. And already - the heel and the sole of the shoe has separated from the boot itself. I'm incredibly disappointed. The quality of these are sub-par. I could fix them, but I should have just bought a nicer pair of boots. They didn't even last a season. Not worth your money, ladies. They'll fall apart on you after not even a month of wearing them!"
"Was looking for a cotton spandex combo, similar to the Jockey GO briefs which have, sadly, been discontinued.  Prefer a full brief but this brief is almost full and a half.  They are so long, even after washing, that one or two fold downs of the elastic are needed to get em to my normal waist.  Every other full brief I've tried/used fits me fine and go just to my waist.

These are just extra, extra, extra high waisted.  Returned the other unopened packages and gone to looking around again."
Is what i feel like when i wear this jacket. I am a Woolrich fan and my dad loves his jacket from here but this is not flattering at all.
"I love this backpack but its falling apart already!!! For a backpack that cost that much, it shouldnt be falling apart."
I had these glasses two days before they broke. Worth about .99 cents.
"Ordered 2 shirts from the same company. They fit just fine, not too tight, not too loose. I bought another pair from the same company with the same problem. Wherever these are made, I am sure that there's no big people in the design/layout department."
"I wanted to love these boots, but didn't happen. The absolutely worse thing about them is the fact that there is no heel support! The boot slouches inward the same way that u.ggs does and that is just UGLY! And while I understand that this does not happen to everyone, it is more common than not. Obviously that is also unhealthy for your foot. while I did like the color and the faux fur, I did not like that the boot was much higher on my calf than I expected (I'm 5'8 and it was well over the mid-calf) and the tongue of the shoe is even taller and weirdly pointing up (should have paid attention to the pic)."
"did not look like the picture, pretty off putting honestly. the shirt was weird and ugly. will never buy from this company again for the false advertising. i don't trust them now."
"I ordered the plus size. What i received were leggings with no tags indicating brand or size. When i held them up they looked like they would fit my granddaughter who is 10 years old. No these are not ""Mopas"" nor are they ""plus size"". So even though it was a waste of money purchasing these for me, at least my granddaughter will have some knock off fleece lined leggings."
"Totally disappointed! The heel of the shoes is rubbed down after three days . I've bought a few items from Deer Stags and never had this problem, I'm not sure if this was in storage too long."
"Ecco shoes don't have the quality of years ago.  Cheaper leather, made in China.  Very uncomfortable on the top part of my foot.  Not what I expected, not nearly as good as my 15 year old Eccos.  Had to return them."
"Stands out at the bottom and is funny looking. too stiff.  Have washed and used fabric softener hoping it will lay down better.  Returns don't seem to be too easy, will not buy this type of product again, too risky for the money."
"These socks run a bit large I think. The heels tended to pull up too high on me (size 10.5 sneakers). The build did not look to be a very good quality either. The material was comfortable, but I returned due to better fit with Champion's other line (C9) and a competitor's socks at a similar price point.
I prefer a more snug fitting sock, usually with a bit more elastic around the arch to keep the fit right all day."
"I give no stars (it made me give it one star), it is not like the picture! I understand it's cheap, but still not worth it!  It is short!! It looks like it would be long and slouchy, witch it is nothing like that!"
should have listened to other reviews.  I have been eyeing this bra for years and never bought because of the reviews.  I should have listened.
"First day worn, the yarn was frazzled and broke. the ends where the leather knot is came undone. Too much hassle for the price to return, I just retied and hot glued it"
Way to small. I could barely get it on and it took forever to take off
this does not separate fits like a sports bra and comes up very high would need to wear a round neck shirt with it - the lace shows through shirts and just unflattering - I was hoping to find some comfortable bras that didn't have an underwire and ordered several of this brand was disappointed with all of them. I wear a 38F to a 36 H on a medium build I like a bra that supports but is also figure flattering - these are not  looks like a granny bra with pointed cones. the best bra I have found for large bust is Fantasia they give you the nice round look and are full coverage. But they do have the underwire.
The box was small.  The sandal  inside was a match for the box.  Small.  Had to return.  They are cute.
fell apart as soon as we got it.
My bead was ran over by a vehicle and squished! Unable to feed onto bracelet and unable to see the peacock as pictured. You can see tire tracks on the envelop. I don't usually write negative reviews but this should have addressed before delivery. Please rectify this problem.
Cute tap shoes but even the Wide fit is too tight in my toddler.
Only 2 came in the box.
"Way too big...definitely get a size smaller than what you normally wear, it still might be baggy. I finally gave mine away since I couldn't return after washing."
"I have to say I was sadly disappointed when I received these. I thought they were going to be way different because I like Mustela products. I opened them up and the scent was very strong and I didn't find it pleasant. It says they are delicately fragranced or maybe I have an extra strong sense of smell but I was quite worried to use them on my kids as we use unscented and cucumber wipes. Having a girl I don't think you should wipe them with any scents so I did not use them on her, just my son. So as I was pulling one out I was also surprised to feel that these really aren't thick at all, they are very thin and quite flimsy. I had to use quite a few to completely wipe my son clean from a #2. They did wipe fine but I also don't fee like they were very moist but I think that's because it's so thin it can't hold much moisture. I will not be buying these wipes in the future. I have purchased wipes just like these at discount retailers when I was in a pinch."
These sizes are better suited for children and not adults. I ordered XL and it was more like an XS.
"Very thin material, feels cheap."
This was not 'coral'. It was baby pink.
"Item arrived dirty; not like it had been worn previously, just dirty.  It seemed that maybe somehow dust got into the plastic packaging.  Item appeared to be new and be in its original packaging which include removal of about a thousand pins."
This is the end of my interest in Lacoste shoes.  They are too painful to wear.
"One shoe was size 11. The other was size 13. They were supposed to be purple, and my order says purple, but the shoes look magenta. Also, they were clearly used before; really poor shape. Surprised they could have left any warehouse in the condition they were in. Returned them the same day they arrived and would not buy this brand again."
This belt is very tiny.  Ia m a size 8 and I fortunately have a sewing machine and some black textured vinyl and can add a section to the back without much trouble. Still....
"Worst quality ever....sole will start separating in weeks.  I have been a NB customer for decades, and these left me feeling cheated letlone needing a new pair of size 12.5 while living in Asia, with high tariffs."
"This is shrug is child size! I usually like things a bit loose fitting so I purchased a Med/LG, It would not have even have fit an adult/petite size small (if you are the proud owner of a bra size any larger than 32 AA) -. Maybe pre-teen size. Yes, it is a shrug but this is beyond tiny! There was also a string that was just hanging/semi attached/woven oddly in 2 places. Something that was noticeable enough that a person packing would have seen it and should have taken care of it. The shipping time frame was also far longer than expected. I thought I would have received this for a vacation but it was in the mailbox when I returned. If you are itsy, bitsy, teeny, weenie, order a month before you need it. All in all, I guess I did get what I paid for at the price...buyer beware."
quality of the shoe is not good. Didnt like it so sitting in a box in my massive shoe closet. Will give away to someone SOON.
"Hat is way to big, it literally covers my entire head. There is absolutely no way I will ever wear this. Don't bother buying this unless the top of your head to your eyes is about a foot long, not even joking."
"top of ridge rubs my foot , foot becomes very sore , can not wear for a few days..."
"Really to large, it is not the right number!"
"You can see completely through the leggings. If you are covered waist to upper thigh, then this would be a good costume.  This is NOT yoga pants unless you wear shorts OVER it"
Well all I have to say is NEVER WASH this product. It will fall apart. So that's why I'm giving this 2 stars I wore it once down in Mexico and it was comfortable and baggy. But it's nothing really special.
"The bag is terrible.
- Biggest issue: It does not sit upright when you put the bag down.
- The pockets under the flap stay wide open so that if the flap is up and the bag tips you have a yard sale.
- The one bottle holder is on the right side of the bag. If you sling the bag over your right shoulder, the bottle is tough to reach.

The one pro is the option to unzip the bag to lay it flat for airport security."
Much smaller and less drape than pictured. This is more of a neck warmer scarf. One side is red the other burgundy. Not what I thought it would be at all. Returned it.
Don't buy these. They are clear patch of tape approx 4x6. A real joke. You can eat Mother Nature anyway.
The shoes don't match one is more textured than the other. Leather looks a little cheap. I'm very disappointed... returning.
details are not very good. Low quality and not what I expected to get...
within 6 months all the color was off the chain and heart
Possibly the most cheapest crappy bag I have ever purchased. The zippers broke and I barely use it. The stitching came undone in several places. Time to toss this out. The zippers are cheap and break easily and they run off the tracks. I never over stuffed the bag. It only needed to hold my shirt and shoes. Very disappointing bad merchandise.
Can packaged w tiny holes in the shirt. Looked like moths got into the shipment:/ not good.
its not leather
"I mean really? Return them immediately. I read the reviews and always considered my feet narrow. So i got them. But this shoes are soooooo narrow. I wasn't able to put them on. It took me two month to air them horrible plastic odor. Shoes came with strong smell of plastic. The whole house smelled plastic for about 2 month. Afterward, i decided to put them on in a hope to stretch them. Nope, didn't work. Horrible shoes. So disappointed in FRYE."
"Way too small, though I ordered a half size bigger than I usually wear."
"I wear a large in most clothing for the upper half of my body. I read that the jacket fit small, so I ordered an extra large. It was way too big around my waist but I could barely get my arms in it and it fit so tightly across my back and chest I could hardly move. It says men's extra large.

Are Americans really so out of shape that fashion is scaled down. I am by no means a body builder."
"but to a good quality at all ,expensive for nothing the skin came out after two wear."
"The dusty pink was really dusty salmon. I like a loose fit, but the size small fit me like a large. I had to return it."
Small for the size it was supposed to be and the special washing make it more hassle than it is worth.
I needed a new nursing bra but didn't want to spend a lot. So I guess you get what you pay for. The nursing clasp on one of the straps lays a certain way that it digs into me. It leaves a red mark and it hurts! Otherwise it fits well and is ok. Not very flattering but what nursing bra is?
Way too small and zero give. Very cute design though and has a cute little belt. Will be handing off to a friend. I recieved this at a discounted price
The XL runs very small. The picture shows it loose fitting but it is a stretchy material and fits tight.
This shirt was not sewn properly on the sides. Cheap fabric as well. Wouldn't buy from again.
"Color is great, but that's the only good thing I can say about it.  Way too big -- large is more like an XL.  Thin material that sags even more as the day progresses, even though nothing's stretching it (because it's so big).  Not recommended."
"Same size shoe as other Keen that I have, but this style fits very snugly. I was able to return for a refund, not problems."
Too small.  I had to return for a refund.  It is very hard to tell what your correct size is.
To tight color was not white it was full on cream. Don't like that people can say one thing and u get something else.
Very comfortable walking shoes till the bottom fell off! Lol
"Started coming apart after only 2 times wearing it. I have worn it twice, it's not even that tight but it's already coming apart at the seem."
"Firstly, these pants are a bit small in the crotch.

If you wear pants and they are small in the crotch, then you know how that feels.  I don't have to explain, it is my disdain.  Pants of quality that don't fit right are a travesty.  That is what these pants are like.

Also, I would say don't get the twill.  The fabric is slim and the upper leg and crotch area don't give much room, so no stretchiness.  I feel a bit restricted.  Wearing these in my chair at work I thought they were going to burst, leaving me exposed.  I might break these in a bit, but first off they are uncomfortable.

Had I been at the store and tried these on I might have passed, just a heads up.

My Advice:
Go to a retail and pick these up, they may fit better.  Not for the winter months either, these are some thin cotton my friend.

But they do look pretty okay; however, they fall off my ass.  I find that weird, especially since they are too tight in other places."
My daughter does not like these at all.  She is constantly scratching at her lower back and taking them off.  We don't have this issue when she is wearing the pull-up brand.
"Seriously, NOTHING morphsuit makes comes in 2XL. I am tall and XL just doesn't cut it.
I bought their open wound Halloween bib and it was awesome but the rest of their stuff...

Come on Morphsuit - do us taller guys some justice.

Note: I made my own sweatshirt by taking an ugly Christmas sweater, some material and making my own pocket in the back.
Yeah, I used their app for the eyes and it looks pretty good. I have no misgivings about using their app when they don't offer larger sizes - had they made these in 2XL I would have bought the sweatshirt.

Edit. Gave it two stars cause their products are pretty cool, and D. Vanco was crying."
The package arrived open so I didn't receive my merchandise. It appears that the package wasn't sealed good and it fell out. I'll reorder soon.
"the shoe looks real nice but i was wearing them for about 4 hours when the toe strip started to peel off the shoe. i had to walk around all day with a strap hanging from my foot, i was so embarressed at work and i would have contacted the seller but they are not available to contact for some reason. i was able to glue it back on but i don't know if it will hold. very disappointed i usually have no problems with puma."
Returned for a refund - hurt my feet.
This bra is made of soft material and looks like it would be comfortable but unfortunately an Xl doesn't fit properly. I managed to get it on but the cup size it too small and doesn't support my boobs as if like. This product gave me major side boob. If you are big breasted this bra will not fit properly
I love them! But Ive only had them two weeks and the arm is already breaking 
This bralette is so small it won't go around my chest and hook. I'm a size 5 in general. 34-29-33.
"Update - 4 months - less than 100 miles on the shoe.  Black inlay has peeled off from the sole.  Contacted Altra, suggested I use Shoe glue to glue it back on the sole.  I felt the shoe is defective as the sole should not becoming apart after less than 4 months, and less than 100 miles.  Requested a new pair of shoes from Altra... have not heard back from Altra customer service department."
Little big but the right one is not aligned right so foot hangs off the right side.
I bought this item for a 1920s themed party. Once received I noticed a chemical smell coming from the product and it wasn't anything like the picture online. Color was off also. Very disappointed and returned the item.
"Shrank at least an entire size the first time I washed them. I was very amazed at how much these shirts shrank. Be sure to buy at least one full size if you decided to purchase these. I am a very skinny guy and like to wear my shirts a bit larger on me. These were perfect the first time I wore them. First wash, now they go to my belly button. Whoa!"
"This dress was cute but just too short.  I wanted to love it, but I am 5'8"" & 120lbs and the size small fit nicely everywhere BUT only came to mid-calf.  It would have been amazing if it had been toe-length.  I returned it.  :(  Would probably be really cute on someone much shorter."
Barely any hair
Bad if you have skinny ankles
"My son likes the design and was happy to get new shoes, but the back is poorly designed and causes him pain in his ankle area.  I wanted to return them, but he insisted on keep them hoping the pain would go away after wearing them a bit.  I bought the extra wide, but these are not quite extra wide, I would say they are just wide.  Overall they are poorly designed.  I have purchased a lot of New Balance and I have to say they are getting progressively worse.  They  used to last a lot longer, now I am buying my son shoes like every 2-3 months.  The material literally starts to fall apart within 60 days.  The shoe laces break very early only sometimes after 30 days.  The sewed parts start breaking lose and holes appear around the toe area about 60 days after first use.  Finding extra wide shoes is challenging, otherwise I would have ditched New Balance long ago."
"Cheap, thin flimsey and a huge hole in it!  Had to return it."
"These socks are full of acrylic, which is the worst possible material for clothing, with the possible exception of cardboard. The product page for these socks lists only wool and nylon, and that's deceptive."
Returned for credit.  Not as expected nor is it worth the money.
Was not what it looks like. The product I received looks far cheaper and crappier than the picture.
Poor quality !!
Poor quality material. Looks very cheap and washed out. It's very thin and see-through. Was very disappointed. Had to return product.
uncomfortable..
Quality sucks
very tight. I did not like
"This was my second pair ordered from the same vendor just a different color. If I wanted to have to alter the pants I wish there would have been an inseam question as to length. The same product in size of a different color shouldn't be over 6"" longer."
"Returned next day! Right foot fit, left too small. Please credit discover card!!!!!"
As it is labeled as having a french cuff and this is very desirable for me. The only reason I went with these shirts.
"I wish I can give this product 0 stars. I searched and searched for the perfect flat and had high expectations for this purchase. I was so excited until I opened the box. The flats were very cheap quality. And after spending $50, that shouldn't happen. And one shoe was clearly larger than the other!!! I was extremely disappointed. Sent back the next day."
Not all sanuks are created equal. I've owned 6 pairs and this one just looks weird and started tearing at the seams between the rubber sole and cloth
Plastic mustache and eyebrows.  The picture showed furry brows.  Not true.
"I almost called the Smithsonian when I opened the package.  I am fairly certain this is one of the original sails from Christopher Columbus' journey across the ocean blue.  Kind of weird they are marketing these sails at shirts.  He only had three ships, how many of these can there actually be???"
"I have several Del Rossa nightgown and I've always liked very much their cotton. But now... I was very disappointed with this nightgown because it is not 100% cotton. No, it is not."
I wear a nine but that nine runs very small :( they cute doe
"I have been buying 900 series new balance shoes for almost 15 years.  I loved them.  In the past I always bought the 993's and they were great.  A while back went into the Brighton factory store in Boston and bought two pairs of the 990's.  Haven't worn the second pair yet, but the first pair only lasted a couple of months before the soles fell apart.  I don't run in them, i just wear them around the house on the weekends.  I had the same problem that many other users are having with the soles coming apart.  The foam core just rots away, causing the sole to separate and the shoe to collapse on itself.  I reached out to New Balance customer support and they told me that the shoes looked loved and that the wear was normal.  Unfortunately it looks like they have discontinued the 993.  I really want to buy New Balances, but if the other pair holds up like these, i won't buy New Balance ever again."
"I'm a very average ""medium"" T-shirt kind of gal and this shirt fits HORRIBLY awkward. The sleeves are too short, it's too tight around the chest (and I do not have a large chest), and the torso is baggy and short. This was an absolute waste of $19 but it's not worth shipping back. I'm extremely disappointed and surprised that Champion is so incompetent at designing well-fitting women's shirts."
I bought 2 of these hoodies in different sizes for the grandsons. The hoodies fit as expected but the big problem is the zipper.  It is a very cheap zipper that is almost impossible to start zipping. The boys tried the hoodie on and immediately had problems. In fact they ended up pulling it off over their heads because they couldn't get it unzipped. It took me 10 minutes to get it unzipped. I tried to zip it and found it was nearly impossible.
These don't match anything and they're really big.
Pretty but fit me weird .  I returned it.
"it was nice, just didn't like how it looked on me, I'm petite :("
"The onesie is long enough, but too tight around the middle."
"I'm returning this, as ""Under Armour"" is written repeatedly on the straps.  I'm not a fan of advertising on my bra straps, and I had hoped to use this less for sports and more as a racerback bra for under a couple of racer back dresses I have.  Since inevitably, a little bit of bra always shows, I'd rather it didn't advertise!"
Not nearly as long as the image suggests. Not as comfortable as my Jockey either. I'm not happy with these at all. Sticking with Jockey.
"Too small, I usually wear ""M"" or ""L"" depending on the style, so to play it safe I ordered an XL, and it still was too small, even as a blouse was too small. For the price I just got rid of it, instead of trying to return it, It wasn't worth it!"
Super cheap then material. Hangs weird. Gave to my child:(
"Not sure if I will the time to return, but these shoes stink. I have loved three other pairs of shoes by Pediped, I have no idea why this pair stinks. I don't know if it is the manufacturing chemicals or the leather, but I do know the pair I got is very stinky and I will not be using them."
"The sizing and design of this bra were just strange to me. I could barely get it on. It didn't fit at all despite me fitting into the same size in other bras -- I know bras in larger cup sizes vary pretty widely, but this was ridiculous. I struggled to get it fastened, and when I did I couldn't take a full breath. Taking it back off was much worse, somehow. I had a ton of trouble getting it back over my head. At one point I was pretty sure it was going to strangle me and I'd die, naked from the waist up, with a supposedly-large-cup truly-tiny-band bra wrapped around my face and neck.
Anyway, it does seem like it would be a very supportive bra if one could get the fit right, and would really keep one's breasts in place during even vigorous exercise. This is one I'd try on in a store if I were inclined to give it another shot and, you know, if I weren't traumatized from the whole experience. (I do wonder why this bra has the word ""yogi"" in the name... what kind of yoga are these people doing where they don't need to breathe?)"
"Pay close attention to the legs of these shorts, they are exactly as they appear, very awkward.  They are somewhat like wearing a diaper, they don't really have much of a leg to the short, it's all crotch with about 1.5"" of legs so they look quite strange.  Also, these are not swim trunks/board shorts, they do not have any kind of liner (built-in underwear/support) and because they don't really have a leg they will ride-up to your groin area as you wear them."
"These fit great, but I was really disappointed to see holes appear after only a couple uses. My kids aren't super rough on socks typically, but these certainly did not perform well for long. Really liked them initially, but won't be ordering them again."
"Okay, thought these were good. Good thickness and feel; wore each pair once; threw them in the laundry with my other dark cotton stuff in case someone thinks I washed them incorrectly. All of the socks now have a hole at the toes. I do not have Velociraptor talons and keep my nails short. Definitely a flaw in the construction, repurchasing new socks from a different brand now."
"I thought I would like these, but they are not comfortable at all.  They were returned."
Material very thin and see through...:(
This runs small I suggest you order a cup size larger than you normally would
My husband bought a couple of these for our daughters and they have broke several times and not due to the girls being rough on them.  They are just pretty cheaply made and haven't lasted for us.
Good looking shirt but wrinkles are a HUGE problem. I ironed it for 40 minuted after throwing it alone in the drier a couple times. It was meant to be a work shirt for my husband but it doesn't look like he'll be able to wear it. Maybe if I soak it in a bottle of fabric softener for a day...
"I bought a pair of these from the Cole Haan website.  I really like how the Dark Roast Grain color looks in the Cole Haan product photos, and I was pretty disappointed when I finally saw them in person.  The actual color is an extremely uniform dark, chocolate brown, and the slight sheen makes the leather look almost like plastic.  The Amazon product photos look more like the actual shoe.  I'm hoping with a bit more wear, the leather will break in and start looking more like the Cole Haan photos.

In terms of comfort, these are probably the least comfortable shoes that I own.  Again, I'm hoping that everything will soften up as the shoes break in.  The soles feel very hard and the heels seem unusually high for men's dress shoes.  The product description mentions Grand. OS cushioning, but these Carters are no where near as comfortable as my Cole Haan Cranston boots.  Additionally, the bottom of the heels felt like they were slightly angled until I wore them down a bit.  At first, the angle of the heels was pronounced enough that I could actually rock back onto the heels.

The worst part is that the right shoe in my pair has developed a squeak after about two days of wear.  I believe it's coming from the sole of the shoe, but no amount of flexing or scuffing has made a difference to the squeak.  I bought these as final sale, and I've already worn the shoes to the point where I couldn't return them anyways, so my only hope is that they'll break in nicely."
"I ordered this in a medium the top fit perfectly the bottom was more like a small or extra small, so I ordered a large and the bottoms were even smaller almost like a kids size... i''m 5'6"" and weigh 127 lbs I would wear a small/med normally... its a horrible product don't waste your money I have 2 of these that I can only wear the top to..."
One of the earring magnets missing so they are unwearable. So disappointed
Too small. Said Medium Mens. It came very small. Can't wear it. Delivered early. Nice color and soft. Too bad it was so small.
"The dress isn't was pretty, but no way was it made for any woman with curves. The fabric is way too clingy and sized all wrong. It's better to try these type of dresses on in the store since their sizing chart isn't anywhere close to correct."
"The material was thin, textured & shiny - didn't look at all like real leather."
I have a problem returning items so it's going to the donation pile..the dress it's not what expected too big and just not flattering on me at all. That doesn't mean it will not look good on somebody else though. It just didn't work for me.
"I pre ordered the LEAF directly from Bellabeat.
It looks pretty but that's about it.
Steps are not tracked accurately and I can't enter any other activities. Sometimes it tracks my sleep and sometimes it doesn't. The customer service is a joke as well by the way. If you have a question, be prepared to get vague half answers that will leave you just as dumb as you were before. All in all this is a piece of crap! My iPhone does more than the LEAF and more accurately too."
"Fit really well, felt great. Unfortunately snaps kept popping open. Needs a better closure system. Returned without a problem."
"not worth it , only one pair comes in.... better off going to the mall. Also very cheap feeling, flimsy."
Nice outfit.  However it is way to small and i ordered xl.  I wear xl in everything else
Very cheaply made.  Bend too easy.  I would say price is too high for these earrings.
Am kind of dis Appointed It said its water resistant  but even if suede a bit it gets some moisture inside the glass covver6
I usually love these leggings and have purchased 3 pairs however this last one had a hole within 2 minutes of wearing.
"looked great in the photo, but the criss/cross front was not so comfortable.  I think you need to be pretty small to wear this and not have it shift and be supportive holding you in."
This was impossibly small.
"48-50  Not True
I was disappointed. The material is nice and the color rocks but half the time it's falling down."
"This is what wearing cardboard must feel like. Pure garbage, probably the crappiest pair of pants I've ever had the displeasure of owning. Went straight in the trash after repeated attempts to soften the material."
Not firm control.  Lace on the top is very flimsy.
"The place on the sides where the straps meet the sole stick up and push on your feet.  Very uncomfortable.  Also, the soles and narrower than my other reef flip flops.  I sent these back."
"A poorly fitted victorian-ish Steampunk outfit. This will work for you if you've got decent accessories to distract from the low-quality materials, are no taller than 5'10"", and have neither a barrel chest or a beer gut, but you'll wonder why they didn't do better.

The pants: elastic waist-band (back), but not very elastic, so the actual range of size is limited (they could have used a drawstring). The length was fine for me (5'10""), but they are surprisingly snug (especially across the rear), with no pockets. There's no trim other than the leather-like patches which aren't on the inner thighs as pictured (as some other reviewers also note, so not just an error in my copy) but rather below the knees, like sideways kneepads. Weird. The low-quality hems demand you tuck these into boots or get especially tall spats.

The jacket: It's really short (ends above the waist), has no pockets, and is flimsy. Don't expect warmth, nor will it cover your belly enough to use a runner's pack (essentially a flat fanny pack) to hold your stuff...and since there are no pockets, you'll have to improvise. Annoying. I normally wear a size 42 jacket, and this barely fits me. This should really be a longer, more substantial, and have some basic pockets.

Ideally this sort of top-and-bottom men's costume should cover whatever you wear underneath, but this jacket does not.

Materials: Flimsy polyester. No lining or edge trim.

I actually bought this item locally because I needed it in a hurry, but note that Amazon's price is notably better than the seasonal pop-up stores. Just plan further ahead than I did!

If you're tall, larger, want pockets, a full outfit, or quality materials, look elsewhere."
I was looking for something light and comfortable to wear around the house in the summer when it is really hot. This looked cute on line but when I got it I realized it was like a Granny house dress and the print was almost exactly like some kitchen curtains I used to have years ago. It looks like an ugly table cloth.  The material was also a little heavy and not as light as I would have thought but it doesn't matter because I would never wear this.
I did not realize these were extra small for I wanted very long ones.
"Too small, flimsy and itchey, looks terrible, completely the opposite of what was advertised. On the plus side Amazon agreed to let me send it back and gave me a  label without any hassle. So I have had pretty good luck with JCPenneys long sleeve shirts but I will have to wait till the end of summer before they are available as they think this is a seasonal item."
"I am 130 lbs 5'9""....US size 6. I ordered a large.  These were so small!!  Could not get them over my hips.  And they were so short that the legs fell just below my knees.  Only buy these if you are 10 years old....or a munchkin on the yellow brick road.  Not made for Americans."
"Not a big fan of this bra. I purchased the 38DDD and it has thicker straps than what's pictured (which is fine). It seemed comfortable at first, but the fit was a bit off -- it dug into the underarm area because it sat pretty high, but if I loosened the straps they slipped off. After wearing all day, however, this was definitely not comfortable and required constant readjusting. The bottoms of the cups sit loosely so my breasts would slip under causing underboob and completely defeating the purpose of a bra. The straps also slipped off constantly."
"These were broken when they arrived, I had to send back. Very cheap material and scratch easily."
Several of my cases (3 out of 6) would not snap shut. They are useless and have been discarded. Too bad because the size would be perfect if they only worked.
the quality is ok but is very delicate i rip off the button just by open it what a piece of crap i expected more but looks nice to the eye
ordene una talla 34 y es muy pequea en comparacion a otras que tengo de la misma talla de resto el material es bueno y la correa se ve bien
"The part that sits over your hand curls inside out and you see a nasty seam and the inside of the fabric - makes them look cheap.
They fit nice around the arms."
"The width of the soul is for narrow foot not medium as listed. I wear size 11 medium width shoes and these boots are so narrow at the ball of the foot it's actually painful to try them on. The heal, shaft and calf of the boot are perfect and beautiful. My calf is nearly 20"". I ordered size 11 extra wide calf and it fits with room to spare in the calf and length of soul. I don't think it's possible to stretch out the ball of the foot on the boot enough to make wearing them pain free so will probable return them."
"Really thin material, not rain/water proof. Would not re-purchase or recommend to anyone."
they did not last
"Honestly, I didn't even try it on. The fabric is a very stiff material that will definitely be super heavy to wear all day! Maybe a good dress for the winter, but definitely not in the summer!"
"I received a leopard print cardigan in size medium, but ordered this top in XXL. Not sure what happened. Disappointed."
Gorgeous but multiple strap/strings broke
"Look super cute, but they were WAY too small. I fit comfortably in an 11, and that's what I ordered. Nope, the straps were stretched to their full potential and nothing. I'm super bummed."
"Silly, silly design - they fall off all the time.  Hate them, they look like new still only because I should have sent them back but didn't!"
Dress arrived with a broken zipper. Couldn't even get it on.
The fabric is more like polyester tablecloth kind of  fabric. Don't expect the solid cotton fabric that seems in the photo. Size fits large. Highly disappointed
"I bought one fur ball for myself and one as a gift for someone else.  As soon as I opened the package I got a whiff of the item and it stunk, so I gave it away.  I will not be purchasing it again, and I don't recommend it.  Also, I think the size is bigger that it seems in the picture, so this was another reason why I didn't like it."
Sizing is WAY OFF!
"way too small, way too tight. when they did not work for me, I wear a womens 9 1/2 or 10, i gave them to my daughter-in-law, who wears a 7 1/2 or 8, even she said she they were way too tight."
"You know, it is really sad when companies do not even try their own product out. The reason I say this is because NOT one gift card nor credit card fits in the slots!! I bought this for my father in law and he actually cut his cards down so they will fit into the wallet! Unbelievable but true! I hope the cards still work. I do not recommend this wallet -"
Nice material.  Fast delivery.  But they are just regular underwear.  Not high waisted at all.  Returned item.
Cute but way too big for a small child
This will tear your face up
"Pliers jaws bent from simple use, so now they won't work. Plastic thumbscrew for pin removal tool fell apart after two uses, so now it doesn't work. Pin tool to pry/compress pins (to remove band from watch) tip broke after two uses. Very cheap manufacturing."
"bracelet broke right away, chain a little while later. I tried to fix it and wore it one time. Don't know if I can wear it again without everything falling apart."
"Not the shoe I was expecting.  Up until now, I always had good luck with Wilson tennis shoes... so much so, that was the only brand I would buy.  Unfortunately, these fall way short....  Wear them just a few hours and your feet will be sore due to hidden pressure points and areas where it rubs against your foot and heel... Ouch... it hurts to wear these!  Wilson, you need to UP your game!"
"I have a huge noggin, seriously... like Sputnik but pointy in parts... but this hat still had too much extra room in the top. I could literally pull the top of it over to the side and make a beret out of it. If it wasn't so cheap, I would've returned it - now I'll just wear it as a joke. Thanks Decky for my joke hat - I guess I get what I paid for."
"Finally a pair of jeans that fit. Sort of... (UPDATE AT BOTTOM)

First, the jeans are much thinner than most jeans. I even had a pair of Faded Glory's I bought from wal-mart that felt more like jeans than these do. Levi's are junk, but they are at least jeans and feel like it. That said, I like the thin jeans. They are 100% cotton. So they may shrink a bit. I still recommend them for casual wear. Especially over Levi's so called 'loose' jeans.

The leg is a bit wide though. I wear a pretty beefy pair of merrell hiking boots most days, and boots occasionally, but even these jeans are too wide on the leg and will drag on the ground.

After measuring the inseam with a simple tape measure, I discovered they are 2"" longer than the tag says. So instead of a 34x32, they are actually a 34x34. So I recommend that you get 2"" shorter than you normally do. I know, it sounds crazy and you won't listen to the review like so many others, but I will be returning the pair I got and getting one of each color, only 2"" shorter. So a 34x30. The waist fits more like a 35, but with a couple washes it will be fine.

I am 5'11"" and about 170 pounds, not husky or thin but I do have some squatter thighs. So It's nice to have a pair of jeans that I can actually move around in without getting a wedgie or splitting my berry sack in half just getting out of a vehicle.

I am so torn about every other jeans, that I have decided there is no such thing as good jeans anymore and I will be ordering more of these, only 2"" shorter than my normal inseam. This is the reason for 3 stars, good and what I needed overall, but you get what you pay for here and don't expect the finest denim made in America wranglers.

I have attached pics for reference, although I find it a bit hard to take good pics myself without standing in front of a mirror.

I hope this helps.

UPDATE: (see last picture)
So I returned the one pair for two pairs of what I knew would be better sizing, only to get two different lengths. One pair is thicker and about an inch shorter than the other. Inconsistent sizing so I removed another star. I wouldn't buy these jeans again after all this, in fact, I won't be buying denim jeans ever again as much trouble as it's been to find a pair that fits."
"Horrible qualify, not the same shirt as the picture."
"it was supposed to be in a flip,  it was not."
They don't fit like an 18 I should have ordered a size up!!
THIS HAD A HOLE IN IT...
They came apart with in one month.
"They are still in the box and are a gift.  I was impressed with their appearance though.  Very nice.  They came in a little gift box.
Edit: They came apart after one time of wearing them."
Wore these shoes once I think. They're very tight stiff fabric and they don't look cute on bigger feet.
"cheaply made. material super this , so support at all"
"Very well made ring. Good weight and very good look.

REVIEW DOWNGRADED FROM 5 to 2 STARS

UPDATE:

I wanted so bad for this ring to work out long term. Not so much. I washed my hands this evening and slipped the ring off to dry it off as well. I dropped the ring from waist height onto my tiled floor and it broke. Kind of surprising to me since I thought tungsten was tougher than that. It is a nice looking ring, but beware of how fragile it seems to be. DON'T DROP IT!!!"
"I'd wear this around the house to clean in. Very cheap looking. I tried sending it back, but necessary persons allowed me to keep it with a full refund."
"Ok, the top is not designed very well so it's saggy and shows off more then appropriate on the sides."
"This was the worst product I have ever bought off amazon. The  Picture on Amazon, shows this beautiful necklace it looks like a green globe. Now don't get me wrong, I realize that it wasn't inexpensive necklace. You do get what you pay for. But I've purchased other inexpensive necklaces off of Amazon and I was never this disappointed. I pulled it out, and just  The stone alone, being flat instead of round, was quite shocking. I also purchased it because I thought that there was no tarnish ability to it. I thought That it was made out of beads and ropes but the back of the necklace is a cheaper gold flake and is Def tarnishable. I mean I guess that's what you expect for an inexpense necklace.  But I definitely do not recommend this product for anybody. Unless you're five. Then maybe you'll find it great"
Incredibly POOR quality.  The fleece is almost see through in most areas.  I bought this for my husband as an anniversary gift and was too embarrassed to give it to him.  It's not the typical Columbia quality you find in the stores.  Guess I learned the hard way - you get what you pay for.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone.
"I have two older pairs of  size 9 AU / 10 US 500s that fit perfectly from the start. But these were too tight, as if I needed at 10.5 US instead. Sending them back, either there's a problem with this production run or Blunde has changed their sizing. Also, am I imagining it or do these feel these feel lighter in the construction materials than my other two pair? Hard to be sure but I think they may be. Weird. Loved my Blundes so, I'm going to try next pair in physical store to see if these were just a fluke."
"The accents are plastic.  I wore these on a long walk and my feet have never hurt so much.  These are NOT running or exercise,shoes.  Ok for casual ware for a few hours."
Cute shoe but the velcro came unattached from the base of the shoe after about 5 wears.  I hadn't even had them a month.  Now they are unwearable. Really too bad because they are cute and fit well.  The velcro buckle though is chinsy.
"I'm really disappointed in this pair of GV Amandas.  Not only do they run weird in size--way too long in the crouch, OK in the (average)  length, and larger in the waist--but they are magnets for fuzz and lint.  I know that black is bad for picking up ""stuff"" but the fabric in these jeans is simply awful for grabbing anything floating in the air.  I wouldn't wear these jeans out and about as they look terrible with all the lint and fuzz on them.  Since they are not comfortable, like all my other Amandas, I will be returning them to Amazon."
"It's a question really.  I am 6'3 and 270. I used to be able to wear XXLT  Lately they shrink up on the sleeves.  I have some XXXLT but they are a bit poofy if not tucked.  I HATE TUCKEN.  SHOULD I JUST TRY  XXLT  reading that they do run big.

Thanks,,
Glenn"
"One doesn't screw on all the way, not all they way with quality but maybe mine is a fluke"
The color is gorgeous but the shoes is uncomfortable after just an hour.  It is big on my feet but the shoe is inflexible and hurt. I am so disappointed.
Ordered in narrow width but was too wide.
"I bought this ring based on the many positive reviews. However this ring is poor quality. The stone size is accurate but the prongs and band and shank are razor thin. Probably 1mm if that. Returning. Found a very nice one at Ross for same price, sterling silver and well made."
Way to small. These are like children sized shirts
Need sizing chart
Not a fan... toe hurt =s when you wear these shoes.
I expected better for the price.  I've purchased a lace wedding dress for $20 more in the past.  The crown is bent (not sure if it is fixable) and missing jewels.
Scratchy material and very cheap feeling. Fabric stretched and stays that way. Not soft at all. Very thin.
It's lower than it looks more like a hipster and doesn't stretch very well  very pretty though
"Not as small as some and heavier than others, so I returned."
Go three size up !!!!
"wanted to believe that the strap problem was fixed with these bags, first time using this walking to the gym today, on the way back I can clearly see the strap starting to rip."
"I ordered these boots for my husband last month; they were delivered on Oct. 6, 2015.  Today, less than two months later, one of the rivets (where the shoe laces go through) broke apart.  My husband does not have a way to fix the rivet.  He says the shoe lace will eventually tear through the leather of the boot without the rivet in place to protect the opening for the shoe lace.  I hope someone from Timberland or Amazon reads this review and lets us know if we have any option here.  These boots are expensive.  A rivet broke within two months and my husband doesn't even wear these boots daily - maybe 2 or 3 days a week!  It is sad to see shoddy construction like this for a well-respected brand like Timberland.  We welcome any solution here.  Thank you."
"Quality was great, but way too small!  I had to return it.  But pleased w/shipping and packaging."
Nice bag but I am disappointed because I bought about a month ago and have carried two weeks when the strap broke. The D-ring on the.side of bag broke. Not where sewn to bag but the leather broke in half. I am NOT happy.
"These were very cute, but just didn't work. I ordered my usual size 9 1/2, but they were too short in the toe, and too large in the heel.  My toes were tight, but I kept walking out of them because the heels were too loose. I took the shim out, which helped with the toe, but it made the heel even looser.  I had to send them back.  Bummer."
These shoes are crap!! I have had several pair on recommendation of orthotic maker and i'm DONE!! The soles just squish down and curve in a month and the stitching loosens I kept trying I feel like a fool But i was told I won't find anything better because i am a big person .....Ya that was BS Bought IRISH SETTERs Best in a long time Don't buy these they are overpriced JUNK oh and they aren't even close to waterproof
"Waist is smaller than it states, and the inseam is 2-4 inches too long that it states.

Material felt weird and uncomfortable. Not a good pair of paints, I returned them immediately.

I'm going to stick with my carhartts and levis."
Too hard for my feet.
"I needed a woman's 7, so I ordered a mens size 5 as per instructions and it was huge. I returned them. I will try them out in the store next time before I order. Too confusing for this sizing."
It makes you look huge.
Memory foan flattens very quick feels like ur wearing socks I have very sore feet I cant walk around wothout shoes on
"The ""seam"" was feathery looking - not sharp. Not really a seam either, just a line drawn with what looked like a marker. Otherwise the fit was fine. Just kind of cheap overall."
"I need to traipse through a lot of snow, so I wanted something with good traction, easy on and easy off. Since I love to schlepp around in Crocs during the summer,these looked ideal.  Yes, the soles on the Woolly Mammoth clogs are great and the back strap added just the extra security I needed for slippery walks--however I'm very disappointed that after wearing them for about a week, one of those garter-like clasps that holds the back strap to the clog became irretrievably lost in a mall, rendering the strap useless. I tried to improvise, but was unsuccessful. I ended up taking the other one off, too. Also, the linings didn't hold up in the back. One has become like a pesky sock that won't stay up. Well, these are my winter shoes and I'm going to be wearing them until the weather warms up. And in our little part of the country, the groundhog did not see its shadow, so I am hoping for an early spring."
Feels nice.. more of a medium than a small... tag on the rear ripped a hole in the liner on first wash without being used... sent email to seller but no response
"be careful with this shirt , don't buy it and waste your money , I bought XXL size and its very small and short sleeves.
Its very strange design!"
"I bought my prom dress from PacificPlex that probably was the worst mistake I had got it shipped in On a 2 to 3 day express. I still don't have the dress and my prom is in a week. I ordered the stress 2 weeks ago. I called the PacificPlex customer service and it was the worst customer service I have ever received. they told me if I wanted the dress I had to buy it all over again, I was not going to purchase two dresses and only receive one.my prom has passed and I could not go because I did not have a dress.  They ruined my senior prom!"
"I was very disappointed with these jeans.  I ordered them in 3 different sizes just to be sure I got the right ones, but all the sizes were not right.  These jeans seem to be made extremely small.  They were very tight across my thighs.  Fit fine everywhere else.  Really strange.  Perfect length and nice looking, but just not made right or something.  Hated to have to send them back.  : ("
no support.  makes my foot pronate inward......:-(
Doesn't look like picture
HAD TO THROW THESE AWAY.
"The declining quality of Levi's 501 STF's has been gradual, but consistent over the last 5-10 years. Each time I get the they feel a little less like the jeans I've worn for over 50 years. It's sad, because I have no complaints about where they're made or paying $50 a pair, I just wish they would deliver the same value of a real pair of Levi's 501's and these do not."
"This is the second ring I bought because the first one broke.  I thought it was just a fluke, so I purchased another one because I thought it was really pretty.  This one broke the first time I tried to wear it.  I did not try to return either of them.  Save your money!"
Size is way off compared to others.
Disappointed. Not made in usa! Did not function properly.
I had to return it as it was too snall- too narrow  & restrictive in design! I had even ordered a half size bigger as I intended to use it for walking but it was still too tight! Not at all a good shoe
Too high waisted.
"Fits odd, in addition the thermal material is hardly winter worthy."
"Really wanted these shorts to work out. The legs run pretty narrow. My legs are athletic, muscular-not big, but they certainly are not bird legs. Don't know why CK does this. waist fits, butt fits, legs don't. Cargo shorts should be baggy in the legs."
We are very disappointed in this hat. While it is adorable....It fell apart after wearing only one time.
"cute, but it fell apart after only 2 months of standard use for middle school.  the drawstring cover is unravelled and buckle straps have started to fall off."
"I've ran in these for a week and I'm stilll getting shin splints and a sore arch in one foot. I usually buy Asics Kayanos, but due to poor reviews of the newest model, I decided to try these. They feel heavier than my kayanos also. I'm thinking about returning them. :-/"
I find that the stones fall out quite easily. I wasn't very happy with this product. I have purchased a better quality set but will keep these in case it's needed down the line.
"These burgundy shoes are pretty on the website but in reality the toe area is a different color than the rest of the shoe. Therefore they look cheap and defective. I bought another pair assuming it was just this one pair but the second pair came in exactly the same. The fit is also very poor. I am a true size 7, have never worn anything but 7 medium, but these shoes gap on the sides and again, look sloppy and cheap. I am extremely surprised that a Clark shoe would be of such inferior quality."
This shirt is not long at all. Totally ill-fitting. I wanted to wear it with leggings and it barely covers my belly. I sent it back.
Cute shirt but the fit was not right for me. I am a 40 DD. shirt did not fit right around the breast area and the bottom made me look bigger. Just wasn't a good fit for me. Returned immediately
looks cheap-
"I REALLY wanted to loves these and was super excited about the other positive reviews. When I opened the box, these babies sparkled like crazy. But, after only one shower, the sparkle disappeared and these earrings looked absolutely dull. Super disappointed."
It's not for short people.
Had to return the shoes because it is too large. I believe a 13.5 size will fit but half sizes are not offered.
I cannot beleive the reviews on this item.  Got it as a gift from hubby.  Horrible!  Does not fit properly in any way.  Difficult to get into.  Looked awful.  Threw it away the same day.  Don't waste your money.
Ill fitting shirt. Not made well. Too loose and flimsy. I would advise to check product in store first before ordering.
A bit disappointing and upon opening the packaging the odor was terrible.
They look like a bubble gum machine prize-really cheap feel.
Thi is the worst item I have ever purchased from Amazon. It was very large overall and the front of the top kept sliding down showing more cleavage than I would like since I purchased to wear under a suit for work.
Picture not exactly actually products I return this frame
"These shoes look beautiful in the pictures but were a bit large and had a very hard platform. When I tried to exchange them, they did NOT have free return shipping so I ended up giving them away. Won't buy from this company again..."
Once received was not my style.  Did not like the look.  Great material just wasn't my style.
"Fit as expected cause this is the type of walkshorts I normally buy but, I received a totally different color. So dissapointed. This is not fair."
"Cheaply made (for example, you can see where the white rubber was not cut/processed properly when it meets the blue canvas), no arch, no support, no inner cushioning.  Got what I paid for this time!"
I thought there would be three dangles of Amber but they are all fused in one lump.  Just not as expected.
"cut to small and not wide enough,"
Way to small and not true to size
"The black ones have so much lint,i find the lint all over my house."
sucks you cant adjust band
Socks are very tight out of package and have bad sewing in the toe areas so they hurt when you have shoes on !
Very long but narrow at waist and leg opening. My son is  54'' around 60 lbs so super skinny. And the length reaches his belly button when placed against him but he couldn't get it pass his thighs. Also the material is very coarse.
The fabric seemed okay but the visor was very feeble and just not that sturdy as I was looking for.  I think it was just cardboard.
Not anything like I expected. will probably not use for vacation. Not what I wanted.
"I thought these were gonna be pretty good. The reviews seemed pretty positive. Unfortunately, they are extremely light and fit me like granny panties. I'm petite, so I hoped the small would work out (since the XS was the only size that didn't have Prime). Nope. They came up about an inch or two above my belly button, the legs bunched up all day, and overall I just didn't like them.

I definitely got my money's worth in these. They aren't very good quality. Dunno if I can send these back after wearing one of two pairs."
"Ordered the exact same size as my Wacol and Soma bras, but this was much much smaller in cup and band."
This is NOT for anyone over a B cup...like at all. Returning.
Poorler quality than I expected. Fit large in the torso and definitely need ironing. I returned it
"I order the size I normally order in Birkenstocks and these were too long in the footbed and too wide.  My feet flopped around inside of them, making it unsafe to walk.  I returned them."
Much too short in length. Toes rubbed on the front. Not true to size. Not comfortable.
"The designs on the ties are very good looking and the material used is very nice. I do not, however, like the elastic cords they used to secure the ties around my son's neck. The cords on 2 of the ties have already broken, causing us to find clasps to hot glue on to the ties to be able to continue to use them."
"Use a garbage bag and a vaccum cleaner, works better for cheaper."
"Returned - just too hue and too heavy. THe pressure on the thong and the width (foot slipped around) just made them unsafe. And uncomfortable. In all fairness, my foot runs narrow though I no longer wear ""narrow"" shoes."
"I recently Got these in the mail, and like others before me, they are too large for my face. So yea, kinda a waste of money. However i can always give them to someone they might fit."
"Very nice dress. Frustrating because I follow the size chart when I requested. I asked a 2XL.
Now I can't even prove it. I got it today. I can see I shoild ask a 4XL at least. But this is not fair.to put the measures here and when we get the dress we see that hte measures in your chart are not real. This is why I won't exchange. I.learned how not to trust your informations. God help me never ask.again an Asian size. This is repeatitive. And I always get annoyed and by rhe same reason. Asians.should not truly to sell to thegiant women. They don't know about it and now it's a mess to return. Sell it only to tiny Asians, please? And I am even sure that NOW that is too late I will find in some tiny corner in here warning that it was an Asian product. Ughdrfr...."
Very bad i hate it
Well they were exactly what I thought they were and was looking for quality wise - but there is no way what I got was plus sized. I will have to return these
plastic broke first time I used it
Runs small. Thin material. Nothing special
this shirt was WAY too big and it looked a little cheap. I would not recommend this product.
These were way too tight around the belly... I ordered them during my third trimester. They may be fine for first or second trimester...
"Way, way too short!"
"Too ""fake"" looking. Wanted something a bit more jean-like but the material is almost shiny, and baggy in the hip crease."
"Didn't realize how small the pouch is. Bought these for running, but would have had to wear briefs. Easy return to Amazon."
"I ordered a size larger (38-40) than I take based on reviews.  They were still WAY (maybe 28-30) too small.  The seller should supply honest sizes,  not these that bear no relation to actual size.  Definitely not recommended."
"After a week of wear they are coming apart from where the bottom of the shoe is glued to the top portion, that is seriously junky craftsmanship"
"I totall get that images on a computer screen might not look the same but even if I turn up the brightness on the monitor it is still darker than what arrived: in the box, on the ear, in a shadow, etc.  Returning these."
Shoe fit weird. Had to return. Made me feel like my feet were rolling inward.
"This shirt has bright colors, but on the back everything is crooked.  its not centered."
sizes too small
"watch was absolutely beautiful but did not run so it was returned,"
"I am currently breast feeding, so I need clothing that is easily accessible for the baby. I bought the light blue and black tribal print, which was pretty, in 2X (I am usually 1X). It was still too small on my breasts , but the the worst part was that the stitching under bust unraveled the second time I wore the dress."
"Ok just so I am clear, the BRA portion is terribly made, does not fit any size cup D or A (both were tried) and a total waste of fabric. The panties are fine and the cuffs and chain thing are cute. Very cheap but cute. I would only by as a gag gift. But considering the price it is not a total waste for a very small frail barbie doll figure....."
These snow pants essentially have snow pants material with a thin line of batting in between the layers.  I'm not sure this will keep my kid warm.  I'm hoping it at least keeps him dry.  Seem less warm than the cheapest pair you can buy at walmart.  Really not happy with this purchase as we were buying it for the pants only and to get an extra coat.  The coat isn't that bad.  Actually kinda nice.
These are awkward.
I washed this in the machine according to the instructions and it fell apart. I thought it was because I had some military clothes in the washer with it so the military clothes to destroyed it (they have Velcro on them). Then I washed another one in the machine by itself exactly the way the introduction said to do it. It fell apart also.
"I own 5 Barefoot dreams sweaters in different fabrics and style and a blanket for my bed. I adore them tho they're a bit overpriced. These socks are literally no different than those cheap chenille ones you get at Walmart or Target over the holidays. They're no softer. I compared them to the crappy socks and we'll as my BD sweaters and blanket and the fabrics are drastically different. I would never spend $15 on these. I bought two pairs because my mom wanted them so bad and wanted us to have matching ones or they would of went straight back. We got the pink and it is a pretty color, the tag is cute as usual and the matching logo on the sock is attached very well and adorable. Too bad I just paid $30 for socks I could of picked up for a $1 a piece anywhere else. I hope no one who buys these let's it stop them from buying other BD items because normally it's the softest stuff ever. It's special. These socks are not special unfortunately. They need to go back to the drawing board on these and use their regular heavy weight sweater material or light weight sweater material on these socks. Total disappointment."
It tore before I could even wear it. The material is very flimsy. Be careful trying it on. The bottom of the dress does not bell like the picture. Its kind of flat and stiff.
This bra is uncomfortable under the arms.  It is too high.  I am not a heavy person and this cuts me
"I was disappointed this suit did not fit, it runs very small. Its very cute & the quality is just ok"
I bought this outfit and The bra wasn't even in the package.
"Shoes are an attractive style. Fit is true to size. Canvas seemed durable enough, but poor quality construction otherwise. There is no arch or foot support. The foot cushion is very thin. Rubber tread on the bottom was scraping off. Shoes are not durable and were wearing out prematurely even at this price. Might survive in an office type floor environment for a little longer!! My husband only wore them around 10 times before deciding to return them."
Super cute suit but literally as I tried it on I felt something poking my sides then I see this ... haven't even got to wear it yet
This brand makes their shirts short for some reason. I've ordered other cuts of this brand and they are also way too short exposing my stomach when I lift my arms.
Marked men's but it's actually child size! Very unsatisfied!
Awkward sizing.
"Not for tall plus size women. Shirt is too short, material too cheap/thin, and cut is unflattering."
Returned this item because the toe box was too tight
Not a great fit
"The sticky stuff came off in globs, I was rubbing it off my boobs for days. I've bought one in the past and the quality has significantly decreased."
"These are just ok. They will have to do for now and I won't complain because of the price. They are the perfect size but they are very cheaply made. The clasps are almost impossible to unclip so you need to pull the hoop on both sides to release the clasp, which in return makes the hoop bend. Had higher expectations as they looked so nice in the package!"
This is a longer than normal thin tee shirt cotton top with zipper.  Thats all.  Way over priced.  I didn't bother shipping back.
"Not what I expected, clunky and not very easy to use.  It's a bag though, so I'll keep it."
"I have ordered these twice now size 27/short and received 27/long!!! I am so disappointed because they fit great otherwise, only about 6 inches too long! Sending yet another pair back :("
"It was wonderful for the first time I wore it. When I wore them again, it kept falling down past my butt. Somehow the elasticity wore out or broke within the week? Really embarrassing to walk down the street constantly pulling up my leggings under my dress. :("
"Love the shoe been looking at them for months finally my husband said go for it, when I got them the toe parts so tight I can't really wear them!  I've got quite a few pairs of dc shoes and only have 2 pairs that don't seem made right. Cant return because I put them on wore around like 20 mins bottoms dirty ."
After only a few wearings this sweater is pilling along the sleeves.
"I am giving these one star because they leak. They have the two tone lowers and stitching holds the two types of material together. They failed to add glue to the seam and when you walk in snow or slush as you step the toe leaks water. This happened the first time I wore them so back in the box they go and back to Amazon. Very disappointed in Totes. Second time they let me down. Never again. I'm anti-Totes now!
This is an update to my initial post. I originally gave them 4 stars because while wider than a B they aren't that wide. Hadn't had any snow yet."
Arrived on time. Fits is very small. Nowhere near true to size.
"Smalelr5than others the same size... in the waist, larger in the crotch area. Really thick and scratchy. Not soft like typical panties."
"I did read the previous reviewer who had a problem with this bag being different, but I didn't notice that it was a verified Amazon purchase so I just shrugged it off.  Big mistake - I received the wrong bag.  I'm also very disappointed that this hasn't been fixed, almost 5 months after her purchase. Do not buy the black bag - it doesn't have the hair tie ring, the internal water bottle pocket, and it has a laptop divider that is very inconvenient and makes it almost impossible to use as a functional gym bag."
"Ordered two pairs, exact same size. One pair fits fine, the other pair  is too small in the waist!"
The leather is so cheap that it had a horrendous smell. The smell was so strong that I could smell it before I even opened the box. It  gave me and my wife headaches.
This bra did not fit me at all.  This is the size I wear but I bulged out everywhere.  I returned it.  It's pretty but did not fit.
"Quality of materials seem to be good but the sleeves are severely undersized as far as width. Overall coat size is also more like a large, not the XL ordered. Forget about putting a light sweater on under this, you won't be able to bend you're arms and it will be snug overall"
Too big for a size large
"Cheap, tarnished. A quarter weighs more than this watch. It's pretty, just feels very very cheap. The color was off too"
Very thin only able to use once
"This would not fit the watch band for my new Diesel watch not that its an oversized band by any means, it just doesn't provide a lot of room for a mans watch, I had 2 other watches that were of similar size and they would not fit either.  I think this is more for smaller women's watches.  I wish they would put the specifications for what watch band sizes this thing can handle, my watch band is 24mm.  Even if it was smaller it would still be very difficult to line up the cheap plastic screw in pin with the hole on a watch band.  I tried carving part of the plastic off so I could fit my watch band but it still wouldn't fit right.  I ended up using the thin slots on the side.  I jammed my watch band in there and just took out the blue plastic screw in pin holder and after breaking one pin, I used the pin holder to push out my watch pins and I was finally able to remove my watch links.

I'm only giving this 2 stars because with it I was able to remove my watch links, although I was provided no instructions for the method I used...  I would've given it 3 had they provided specs on what size watch bands this can accommodate (it gives dimensions but does not state the width in which a watch band will fit within it, a measurement in millimeters would be helpful).  If they provided this and I didn't see it than its my fault, but seeing as there are very little specifics about this product to begin and its very cheap (inexpensive and made), I guess I can't complain too much.

Anyways, if you have a watch band thats I would say, larger than 20-22mm, you may want to stay away from this product.  Although it did get the job done, it was a hassle and I don't believe I used it in the way that it was intended, but who knows, there were no instructions provided..."
"The fabric that these ""jeans"" are made of is some sort of uncomfortable, stiff, synthetic. They're not cotton. I didn't like the way they felt on my legs so I've returned them."
"Great shoe, but is not stink proof as stated"
The shoes were too relaxed fit. They felt like they were going to fall right off my feet when I walked.
do no buy this! I have only been using for a month an the whole side has ripped!  BOO!
Too loose in the heel and too tight across the foot. Really good looking boot. I wish that it had fit me like most Frye's do.  Had to send them back.
"Within months of purchase, it started to slow down.  I thought it was the battery and replaced that, but did not help.  I had bought the same watch for my older daughter several years ago, and she used it for 18 months without any problems, so I was sure this would be good for my younger daughter too.  Sadly disappointed - they love the strap design and overall style."
turns colors
"I weight 115, Size a, def to big to look anything like the model. for medium to larger girls."
I ordered this bathing suit using the suggested size chart went up one size and it still doesn't fit. Sad part is I love the print so much I may just order another one (the biggest size they have) after I send back the too small one.
I have this in green and charcoal. The green fits oddly. The charcoal fits great.
This skirt is for a baby. This skirt is so short anyone would be embarrassed to wear
I am sensitive to metal and I can't wear these earings.  They are not for sensitive ears.  They must have nickel in them even though the company says they don't.  I won't purchase again from this company but can say they made a great birthday present for my niece.
Had all sorts of contact points that rub my feet raw.
They were great until I washed a pair - see the shrinkage!
"come without case, belt is in the white bag. I am feeling bad with this, and don't want to spend time to change or return it. I will keep it."
Needs a button or something to keep the jacket together. It was a sloppy look not like picture.
"This was a pretty shirt.  I received lots of comments on it the one time I wore it.  Unfortunately, I washed it.  I followed the instructions BUT it shrunk a lot and I will never be able to wear it again."
"I was so excited about these shoes!  They fit everywhere except the back...the back is so tall it cuts into my ankles.  I couldn't wear them and I was totally bummed.  Everything else was amazing about these.  If you have small ankles, they're prefect...for those of us with ankles that stick out from years of sports, they're not the answer.  I really wish it wasn't the case, because they would get 5 stars otherwise!"
"This bra does exactly what it claims to do--it doesn't cut into your back fat so that you have lumps under a smooth shirt.

However, the WAY that it achieves this feat is by not fitting tight enough to keep the bra in place. The underwire cups ride up and all over the place because the band of the bra is too loose. Comfortable? Sure. Easy to put on? You bet. Does its job as a bra? No. The cups simply don't stay put and the over-the-shoulder straps are made of the same very loose (e.g., extra-stretchy) fabric, so there's virtually no support.

I would not buy this bra again."
"Nice boot but it rubbed my husband's heel when taking a test walk inside our home.
Only one boot did not fit, the other was fine....strange!
Returned for this reason."
"Only brand of jeans that will fit me without having a big gap in the back.

UPDATE: 2/27/15
Since the first pair of jeans was great, I decided to buy another pair. What I got was the wrong color and they were not even Levi's!!! I am extremely disappointed for the amount of money I paid."
don't like these as much as the other ones I had...these can't fold down when you want to take the top down...not practical
I HAVE RECENTLY PURCHASED 2 PAIRS OF BERNIE MEV SHOES AND THE SIZING IS NOT CONSISTENT!  BOTH WERE SIZE 9 AND ONE PAIR WAS TOO SMALL AND THE OTHER TOO BIG.  SO DISAPPONTED!.
"The shoe is too large overall, length and width.  It also has a very stiff upper, the fabric is scratchy, the edging rubs on the top of the foot around the curve.  Completely uncomfortable.  I do like the cushioning underfoot, both the sole and the insole."
Returned because they ran very large and honestly I was happy to return because they looked very cheap.
Cost a fortune to return.
"I bought this item for my 3 years old in a size 2-4 years. These were too small, like a really 24 month old size. Material looked good. I did ask for a refund. Go a size or two bigger."
"There was no sizes to pick from, I guess one size fits all.  It knit was very thin.  The picture appears to be larger and thicker so that was sort of deceptive.  Since the cost was low I will keep it, maybe my little granddaughter could wear it."
"I just received the boots and I really love them. But, even when I wrote the seller about my size concern and received a positive answer about it, the boots came in the size specified but however are too large!. It seems that the size is not the real. I usually buy shoes in 10D size, and even when purchased these ones in a half less size (9.5) are still bigger than the real 10D Size. I whish I took them back but I think is complicated :(. Now I have to know what to do with them."
Material is paper thin very cheaply made. Nothing like the picture. It is a belly shirt for sure. Very disappointed & I want a full refund
It was really nice until I washed it in cold water.  Looks like its 20 yrs old now. disappointed
Only reason I give it 1 stars is cause it fit as it should. The issue is the picture I seen here and the dress is received are not similar. It's not rhine stones on the dress but peices of plastic want to be shine. Might even are falling off and all around crappy product. I am stuck with no dress for my formal event and am having to cancel.
"For price okay.
Scratchy and itchy"
Yah these aren't for thick thighs at all. But it has nice quality
Cheap build quality.  The key ring holder has already torn off.
"These slippers are less effective than walking in socks.  They are very thin and should be looked at as being ""feet coverings"" rather than ""slippers"".  They are also too long for me.  Again, I can't be bothered to return them.  Maybe, my daughter can wear them in the summer."
"These fit well (the wide width) but I agree with others, they are completely synthetic and too cheap looking for the price, and for being Clarks."
I knew the color wouldn't be exact but not this way off.  I ordered the orange PWD005_Orange which is a deeper orange color.  I got it the packaging has PWD005 on it but it's closer to the bright orange one NW02_Orange.  I wanted a fall color jacket for a family photo. I don't really want to wear this one
"To be a fancy flip flop, the shoe wasn't that comfortable.  Sort of hard.  What I really hated was the fact that the heel, which is hard kept clunking and slapping the underside of my heel.  Just too tacky for the price."
"The elastic pops really easily, and it wrinkled with broken elastic strings after one wear"
to big but works for pics
"I actually ended up returning these shoes after receiving them in the mail. The fit was incredibly narrow, a problem I don't generally have with other brands, and I didn't like the overall craftsmanship of the shoe. The glue between the shoe/sole was visible in some places and looked cheaply done. I suppose that is to be expected for a less-expensive pair of shoes, but I was still unhappy with my purchase. The return was quick and friendly, however."
small and they hurt the bottom of my feet
not true to size at all.
No comments'
"It's not proportioned properly, the shoulders look like man shoulders on, and it's all wrong, unless that's the look your going for don't waste your time,  it also is sewn so cheap and the fabric isn't cut to stretch at all, I wear a small or xs in tops, this would only fit a child which would just be wrong."
"Returning these shoes. Love the look, have had similar but discontinued Teva sandals,(which I coveted), thought these would be the same...but they are not. The velcro strap closure has been replaced with a non adjustable snap closure, providing no give and also opportunity for snap to break. Give around ankle  and top of foot essential as foot will swell slightly or a lot in warm/ hot weather, or if on feet for any length of time. Whose idea was it to make the change?  Love the look of the shoe, but of no use!"
"I love PUMA shoes. But this pair was horrible. Poor, wrinkled leather. And the soles looked like they were melted. Poor product."
"Sole broke after only a month. Slip resistance was amazing, and they slip on easy enough. But you can't fix a broken sole with a new insole unfortunately."
Fell apart within 2 months!!
Nice material  However I order XL got the size  I want but  at fit me like X small size
Very heavy on your foot. Not a good shoe if you have flat feet. Used a few times only. Not happy with them.
"This was way, way, way smaller then stated. Wife is a size 7 and this never even came close to fitting. Seller then told me to return it for refund, shipping was 25 to return so I contacted Amazon and filed a complaint....finally got money back. Poor product from a poor seller...BEWARE!!!!"
i didn't NOT like the material so i returned it.
I always take a B (m) width.  These however are not a true B width. Much too tight at the toes sorry to say.
The fabric gets caught in the zipper.  Right away.  Returned.
"So unfortunately I am not a fan of this dress. It is VERY thin and sheer. The chest area is a bit small as well. If the fabric was thicker, and not sheer, Id probably keep it. Kind of a bummer since I like the other dresses they sell."
"The color is more of a loud peacock blue than what is pictured. I realize CMY/RGB values can differ upon monitor settings, but nothing prepared me for the actual extent of the color variance. It has the look and feel of a dance recital costume garment. The solid fabric shown is actually shinier in reality than what is pictured. Additionally, the top is not cut straight across over the bosom, rather it is a sweetheart shape which makes it less conservative looking than what is pictured.

I typically purchase Allegra K garments from Amazon.com and have enjoyed all of my purchases except for this one. I truly regret having bought this top.  I purchased it black as well as in the blue color.  I am giving them away to Purple Heart because I have no need/use for them and no one I know wants them."
Very stiff. Can't really fit anything in it that is not flat. Was very uncomfortable to wear. Bought it for my vacation to Las Vegas but ended up not using it.
Charm fell off within 3 days.
"Meh.....too small, not really smoothing"
Too small to go around my wrist. Very cheap looking.
"This would be really cute, but I'm 5'10"" tall and the fit was too short in the torso. I'm also small chested. I think this one-piece is really designed for the body type of the model in the photo. Someone shorter with nice boobs would look best in this. It just created a bad case of wedgie on me and it didn't look that cute at the neckline."
"bought this for 8 year old, it was so big, it feel down to top of his nose also you could probably get this same quality at local dollar tree.,"
The watch is not as pretty. The light on my watch is not pink; it is a kind of orange.
"Eva said was true to size. I normally wear a medium, but I ordered a large. Still too small. Not true to size!"
The color was not the color I wanted.  It stated teal and it is a darker blue. Doesn't look like photo and I couldn't return.  I could buy at Target for cheaper.
Too tight for big legs
"The size runs too small, the material is flimsy and it tore at the seams on wearing it.  This dress looks fabulous in the photo, but it is of very inferior material and workmanship."
"the crotch is way low. not cut to a ""standard"" athletic, or proportional type....at least not in the larger sizes. Im 6'2"" at 38 waist. I picked 2xl just for usual imports running smaller. This was off."
"They apparently don't know how to make fabric wide, only long. I bought the biggest size and wouldnt even go around my chest."
"Nice boots, but the instructions say to order a size smaller, but being a little incredulous, I only went down a half size smaller and I and I couldn't even get my foot in. I'll try again with my normal shoe size."
"This is not only about 3 sizes too small, it is just ugly.  I wouldn't even wear it as lingerie.  It's going back."
the rings sostinen the bra at the front are a real torture
Got three pairs of pants and these were the only ones that were too small so I would recommend going up a size.
Kinda cheesy quality.  Not what expected at all.
"This is the first Reef sandal I've purchased that doesn't fit. It should be listed as ""narrow."" I don't have a wide foot, but it is not wide enough for my feet."
Sooooo disappointed
"Nope. Pigtails never stayed up, the color was definitely more pink than red, and in general the wig just didn't work. I hadn't expected perfection, but I had expected something I could at least wear. The pigtails sit much lower than the photo, and it's literally impossible to get them to go up higher, and stay up."
"Overall garment arrived timely and was of a style and quality I expected.
Pros:  Well made.  Material was good quality.
Cons:  Ordered a size small.  (I am a size 0/2).  Waaaaayyyyyy to small.  May order another, not certain.

Two stars since it's stylish."
"Honestly, it was my fault for not reading the the dimensions of these correctly. These are SUPER SMALL. I was looking for fake plugs that were a 0g or similar  in size. In gauge terms, these are probably a fake size 6g if that. They are also not comfortable to wear if you have larger earlobes like me. They started to itch after wearing them for a day so I had to take them out."
"I want to love these pants....I love the color and material and they fit fine everywhere except in the waistband.  Just a little too tight, I wish they were more forgiving in that area. :(  5'6"" 150lbs"
Had to send back - difficult to work
"These are cute trouser socks, but the band is too narrow and digs into your leg.  The socks are a little long and go up to the mid knee.  Do not seem like they will last.  Disappointed."
Pencil skirts are a great look but this is designed to be skin tight -- material is cheap and so is the look.
"I would not recommend this shirt to anyone. First lets start with my size. 6'1'', 190-195lbs I lift weights and run 5-6 days/ week. I originally bought this shirt in a large because the models that they advertise are 6' tall and are wearing a medium. The shipping took about 10 days and when the shirts finally got here they were too small. I will agree with other reviews in that the shirts are a lightweight, thin cotton/polyester blend and are comfortable.. So anyway the shirts didn't fit.. thats fair enough, so I sent them back and ordered XL. This time my shirts took about 13 days to get to me but I thought to myself, ""oh well"" at least shipping is free right? I tried on the XL and it was slightly baggy but I thought to myself a quick wash and dry and they'd fit perfect. Well when I pulled them out of the dryer they had shrunk an unbelievable amount. As a matter of fact, I literally grabbed my tape measure and compared the length of one shirt I had just washed and dried, and one that was still new. The shirt I had dried shrunk  3.75 inches! The arms and chest shrunk as well.. basically the entire shirt drastically shrunk. I felt that I had to write a review because these aren't cheap shirts. I bought them from their website and they were 28$ a shirt. Also I bought one of my shirts in black and it looked a bit faded after the first wash too. Overall I think this product is garbage and I will never ever buy from this brand again. T-shirts at target are a better quality than this brand. If you're like me and just want a simple t-shirt that looks and fits well, looks somewhere else because this brand is a rip off."
Do not like the quality of cloth it is made from.
I wore these one day and they already got a huge hole in them. Very poorly made and not worth the money.
"I can't believe these are original New Balance.  They appear to be a very poor knockoff.  The sole is uneven and 'wobbly' making it very difficult to stay balanced.  I thought it was due to the high arch and tried wearing them for a couple of days to see if I just needed to get used to them.  No luck  :(  In my opinion, these look and wear like cheap plastic Chinese knockoffs.  The box shows the New Balance logo but the colors aren't right - just a tad off."
"Looked comfortable in the picture, but don't fall for that, it is misery to wear. After reading that the cups are smaller than usual, I ordered a D cup instead of my usual C cup,  but am still squashed flat.  Yet despite feeling smashed, there is no support - I can't figure out how they managed that. The comfort band just ends up tucked underneath the cups. It's pure misery to wear this thing. And it's beyond unflattering. The cup is shaped like half a coconut....not a natural shape. Bad, bad bra. Most Bali bras are much better than this. Keep looking....."
"Very long, which I was ok with, but even XL was very tight.."
"I ordered ""off white"" and got a tan hat that is, in fact, labeled ""off white"". Since I wanted off-white to compliment a gray coat, this is going back. The picture below is taken next to a white piece of paper and an off-white bubble package. The hat is definitely in the brown realm, and pretty dark. This is going back. It looks like it's decent quality, although it didn't feel warm on my head when I tried it on, but maybe this is how slouch hats feel. Also, it isn't as "" slouchy"" as pictured on amazon. Maybe it stretches....."
They came with flaws I could never use.
"Made blisters on my feet where the lines came together - wouldn't buy again.  Fit well, look nice - but can't wear them"
"I am between an 8-9 shoe size, never larger. These were way too small. My heel hung off the back. I ended up giving them away."
"This boot, for the money, is garbage. I work in an controlled environment the only thing tactical these boots ever saw was a freshly mopped floor in the break room. These boots weren't even a year old and the right boot has a worn spot that's now a hole. It's located just above the heel support. You can see in the picture. The soles started separating just along the edge about 4 months into the wear it's coming off in layers. See the picture.

 I thought a tactical boot would be a great shoe to wear in a casual work environment considering I'm indoors 100% of the time. I really thought the boot would last several years. When I tried contacting 5.11 I kept getting a voicemail of some person who apparently has been out of the office since June of 2016? Emails have gone unanswered so the customer service, or my experience anyway, has been non existent. I really thought 5.11 would stand behind their product as I wear a lot of their products, pants, gloves etc. I will not buy another pair of tactical boots or gloves from 5.11. The money  you pay  versus the quality of what you get isn't worth it. There is NO value in buying these items because they won't last a year in a common environment, I'd hate to have to depend on these boots in an actual day to day tactical situation. As for the upsides to this boot there were a few. The break in time was really short, the zippers on the side are ruggedized and always worked. The leather was easy to clean using a good leather cleaner. My orthotics fit perfectly inside the boot. It's a very comfortable boot, it's just poorly designed. This boot simply won't last."
"Last shirt I ordered was a good fit,size Xl Asian /lrg us. This one came in xl us size. Great color just too large a fit."
"I don't even want to give this necklace one star but I am so disappointed with this necklace I just don't know what to say. First, this is cheap plastic for almost 20 bucks! I honestly wish, for once, I had listened to all of the other reviews of this necklace. Seriously, save your money and find another skull cameo that is actually nice, unlike this piece of garbage that will break within a week. Totally sending back!"
"I'm 5'7"" 160lbs. Too tight in waist, made me feel bigger than I am. Other than that great shirt, but buy bigger."
"this is a piece of junk. Do not waste your money.

The clip is so hard to adjust. a paper do better than this clip. Maybe this is not consider a Clip cause you can never really clip things.

* I have 20 $20bills, i might clip it tightly, and after that i took out 10bills, the clip got loose and you can never adjust the clip to clip the others 10bills tightly. The clip itself is kind of sharp at the edge, and when i trying to clip the money, the money bills got cut off. THis is CRAZY...."
"I have probably 4 pairs of orthoheels and love them.  These were too stiff and cut up my feet.  Couldn't adjust them to fit properly.  My girl friend has same shoes, that are just black leather and not patent.  They are soft and fine.  I have returned mine."
Stitching was uncomfortable.
cute prints but thin and way to big for 0-6mos
"I like the style, with the ruffle and elastic in the back.  The fabric, although pretty and glittery, is not an acceptable fabric for a chemo cap.  I knew it had glitter on it, but I expected this company would know that their caps are being worn on bald heads. Somehow, I thought they would have found a technique to insure that the glitter side didn't touch the scalp.  But, no, it's simply a turned under hem, and it scratches and irritates any part of the head it touches.  This cap is not good to wear after you have lost your hair from chemo.  I assume their other, non glittery fabrics are fine, but please, think twice before you purchase this one.  Although it's fun and sparkly, it's not a good choice."
"The leather on the clip part split very quickly (though past the return period, if course) exposing a very hard, prominent and sharp metal clip underneath.  Dint keep this in the same pocket as your mobile phone if you don't want to scratch your screen or break your camera lens.

On top of that, the wallet was lousy with loose threads out of the box.

Aside from those concerns, it holds the cards and cash it says it does."
"Purchased about 6 months ago to clean pearls and an emerald ring. Seemed to work well but recently noticed that it is starting to clump up and form a bunch of particulate matter in the jar. Weird. Tossed out. Also, as others have pointed out, there is no brush in the jar."
Don't trust the stock photo. Maybe if you hold it at just the right angle you can make it look like that. But otherwise it's going to look fairly dark.
"I'm pretty bummed about having to return these shoes!  I know that if they'd fit, they would have been super comfortable!  They were waaaay too tight with any socks.  Even tight without them.  The length of them is fine; it's how very tight the upper is that makes them impossible to wear.  My feet lean towards being narrow so that shows how tight they are."
"all 4 t-shirts  has a poor quality , the 2 shirts are nice designed but there are too small this is second time when I ordered and the are to small , I will never buy again from TOM'S WARE"
Shoe was just what I wanted but seemed a little loose.
Not worth the price. They are rough & not at all like the picture. Do not recommend this product.
The belt is somewhat thick and he loop was too small for the belt to fit through it.  I had to return the belt.  Hard to imagine they wouldn't make the loop big enough so the belt could fit through it.  Very disappointed.
"My feet and back hurt after wearing this for only a few hours.  Not what you want in a flat, really.  I bought inserts, though, and now they are fine."
"Not a good quality belt.  Looked like pressed leather.  Not a solid piece of leather.  It is however a piece, if you get my drift.  don't waste your money."
Like the design but the size is not true to size (normally wear a 9 1/2) and are too narrow . Will be returning.
These are several times smaller than listed in size!
Returned. Made for little people not US size.
"this is second one purchased in one month.  the first one fell off and was lost the second day.  i hope this one last more than a day.  either way, i will not recommend nor will i re-order.  thanks."
Hate spandex and ts that cling like cling film
According to the size chart I ordered the correct size but it was way too big when I got it very disappointed
weird fit and much more high waisted than the picture shows.
"Settled on a different rash guard, the Oneil Basic Skins Short Sleeve Crew.  This Thermo guard wasn't ant thicker and had a lot of loose material under the arm pit region which was really uncomfortable.  I even exchanged it for an XL, which had the same issue, though slightly less material.  The rest of the shirt in both the XXl and XL was a snug fit for me and I usually buy large shirts."
"One pair fell apart on 1st wash and another one fell apart after second wash. Learn to sew loosers !

Also, These are one size too big compared to this brands other types of underwear"
"This cardigan itself is nice. The fabric is nice and soft and it has a great design on the back. However, I ordered a large and it was extremely small on my arms and it would not meet in the front. I usually wear cardigans to try to hide my midsection, not accentuate it. This cardigan did not help hide my midsection at all. It is also a bit clingy. If you are a larger woman, keep moving, this is not the cardigan for you."
"I will have to return these shoes.  They are so cute but way too narrow.  My granddaughter's foot is not wide. Other Crocs fit just fine.

Very disappointed and so was she.

PS..  If you need to return because they do not fit Amazon will charge you freight."
Very difficult to get on and too narrow across the toe. Surprising for the brand. Returned.
"The actual product is alot bigger than the picture protrayed.  I just needed them to put indidual pairs of earrings in wach section so there is alot of wasted space. I have found that the actual dimensions (as they were in this case, I just didn't pay attention to it),need to be listed because the photo either makes it too big or too little. As I was trying to fill this with my small earrings they are going UNDER the slides that can be taken out. I guess I will have to Super Glue them in!"
"Maybe it's what they use for the sunscreen, but this foundation settled into my pores and looked horrible. I tried putting a moisturizer under it, but it didn't help. Maybe it would work if I use a primer, but I'm not really into a lot of fuss. A young woman with smooth skin might not have this complaint. The opal color was exactly right for my skin tone, which is very fair. But I guess my go-to product will remain&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BOOTS-No7-Dual-Action-Tinted-Moisturiser/dp/B00BN7FCU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BOOTS No7 Dual Action Tinted Moisturiser)</a>."
Very small. Order 2 sizes up.  Comes in tiny plastic bag - needs to be shook out. No straps to hold up lining on bra - there is silicone strip around edge of bodice liner. Bought as costume for show - low price allowed us to work out issues.
"Unfortunately, the product tag was attached spiked through the cup fabric, I did not remove it to take out of the package as I was afraid it would ruin the lightweight knit fabric.  When ordering, I used the size chart posted with this item and selected a Med based on that information.  However, the size chart included with the bra tag was different.  It showed a Medium to several band and cup sizes larger than required.  I did not try on so my response to product fit is an estimate.  I will be returning."
"Very stiff soles. Don't bend. Heel slips out of shoe when walking. This is not a really expensive shoe. Still, with a little effort, they could have done better"
Not a good make material
"I bought these (all in the same size) in black, navy and will soon purchase the silver/grey......but what happened with these khaki pants?! I'm not sure if its a difference in the quality of the material but these pants do not fit well at all! The material seems somewhat softer, less durable, and more...eew,  than that of the black and navy ones. I will not buy this color again."
"Fit is ok
I love how light they are
but I had to return them because they caused shooting pain up my left shin- just from walking.
I even spent money and bought good sports insoles and the pain never went away so back they go.

Too bad  cause I have several other Aasics shoes and I like those"
"Very cute, but way, way too small.... :("
"I like how the dress fits.  The material is not great or what I expected.
It is more like a slip than designer cocktail dress.
I am curvy, so need to stay away from this material"
Do not buy these pants they are incompetently made they absolutely do not fit I ordered a 30 inch inseam and from the bottom of the zipper to the top button at the waist is 18 inches Erkel does not wear his pants that high Up on their waste who is the retard who designed these pants??  I ordered two pair so they were exactly the same crap
These are just not that great looking. Cheap looking pleather. I will wear them for rainy day boots since I got a good price.
"The concept of this shoehorn was just what I was looking for, expandable locking handle and a flexible shoe horn.  The expandable handle worked well but the shoe horn was way to flexible and would flex so much that it defeated me in getting my shoes on.  So sadly I cannot use it.  Would like to return for another product of theirs."
junk not worth a dime!
"i ordered these for halloween, but they arrived late and i didn't get them in time.  they are also too big, but i am pretty small so...  maybe they will work better for someone else."
"I really wanted to love these shoes as casual (with jeans) everyday shoes.....but the toebox (going from the widest part of the big toe to the outside of my foot) was so tight that I could not wear them for more than an hour without pain--I took them to a shoemaker to see about stretching the front but the results really didn't help. I wear them on rare (and brief) occasions now just because I cannot throw them out as they were not cheap. Also unfortunately, they do not look ""crisp"" and black but sort of messy--dusty? Just overall not happy with them. I purchased a size 8.5wide."
Very strong manufacturing smell. Returned.
It was too small.  I did not notice it was a juniors in sizing.  It seemed like good quality.  I would order again if it were in women's.
its too bad change color.  the layer of Silver Rhodium could be better.
"The gold filigree is loose and gets caught on clothes, skin, upholstery curtains etc."
I bought this dress for a wedding and turned out way to small. Very pretty but very disappointed
"Cut is awkward, I'm gonna return them."
"Another cute shoe; too small unfortunately.  Apparently our 8 month old boy has thick feet. The length was great, but regardless of tying the laces ,they wouldn't fit right. Cute though.  Easy to return."
This wallet is complete garbage. Started falling apart within 2 weeks and is unusable after a month. Not worth the money at any price!
Sizes run small. Roxy shoes have inconsistent sizing.
Arrived later then paid for. Material nice. Size smaller.
Too short.  Otherwise I love everything about them.  The color is better than in the picture
Way way way to small. Made for small children.
Not what I expected. I wear it around the house.
Much larger than size states
"Too tight especially on top of my feet, I wish I can open the zipper a little more down, so I ordered 3 But I returned the other 1 and gave the two to my daughters, and the shoe are heavy itself that is only for the skinny feet"
These shoes are so cute but so uncomfortable and tight.  Order a size up.
Tore as I was taking it off.  Not made for anyone who has a broad back.  High priced for a lower end product.
too bad too because the fit is ok.
"The shoe runs a bit large... however, I got two different sizes from the seller - an 8 1/2 & an 11!! Experiencing serious issues with the seller to be refunded due to issues with the return address. Buyers beware!!"
"These shoes are so cute in the picture, but the part over the toes is made in such a way that it cut into my feet.  I put these on and walked across the room (maybe 10 steps) and I had to take them off.  Too bad because the width and length were right and they were exactly the style I wanted.  However, they cut into my feet so badly they were unwearable."
Returning. no support and much to high to be dancing in at a wedding.
"I wear a true 9.5 and ordered the 10. Straight out of the box they were extremely uncomfortable. The issue, I believe, is they're improperly designed. The opening for your foot is about 1/2"" too small all the way around. Extremely stiff and pinching on the heel as well. I've danced in pointe shoes and worn heels for over 20 years. These are just ill fitting and poorly designed. The quest for simple brown heels continues...."
I did not notice the smiley face on each breast and it was an unwanted surprise.
"Love this top! Having a large bust and small waist, I usually wear tops with a waist belt to make sure my flowy tops don't just billow like a bag on me, and this top is perfect without a belt! I was concerned with sizing after reading reviews, but I just went with my typical dress size (6) and it fits beautifully. May be a little low for some, but it's the perfect amount of sexy to pair with a cute bralette. The fabric is classy enough to dress up and casual enough for everyday wear. Super light and soft to the touch, almost like a thin brushed suede feel mixed with a silky feel and super flowy and light. Haven't worn it yet, but hoping the tie stays put throughout the day.

For size reference, I'm 5'5, 34DD, 132lbs, with a pear shape build. The 6 fits perfectly. Buying it in more colors!

UPDATE: I ordered another in gray and the item is awful in color and quality. It is a pearly lavendar color, not gray and it sewn differently than the green one and the fabric is cheap and shiny. It's one of those China knock-off type companies. Super irritated."
cheap. no cushioning or support. avoid the item
I don't like padded and didn't reallize it was
"The length of this shoe fit pretty much true to size, but the sides felt horrible.  The elastic gaped and rubbed my feet."
"Looks nice on the model but shes a model. This was not made for people with normal, muggle bodies. Its looks like a couple pieces of cheap cloth attached together with elastic bands. Also, they all come in single sizes so if you're like me and a large bottom and a medium top, you're SOL"
"Tossed it, Junk"
The left side of this shoe was dirty as if it had been used. The sole was clean but the white strip was dirty..with a red stain along with other marks similar to what it would have gotten if used. The suede was worn on the sides and on the ankle rim...apart from being worn looking it was also almost black. Very very disappointed especially for the price I paid.
"Pretty shoe, but very heavy."
"I used to always get these jeans, but with each passing year the fabric gets thinner and the construction gets worse.  Levis have obviously put more effort into profit than they have into quality.  I recently purchased some Wrangler jeans and they are much better constructed."
"Great for the price, but the chain broke on first wear. Low quality. They have offered to refund it though. Sad for my daughter that received it as a birthday gift and it broke the next day."
"It was too wide for my legs, and not comfortable so I returned them."
"I'm giving it two stars because of the hideous hood on the back of the dress. It completely ruins the look. I am also not a big fan of the fabric quality- it seemed more like sweat pants material than dress material.

Also, I noticed other reviewers were saying this item was ""too small"" but I'd have to disagree. I am a 5'6'', 125 pounds, and the small/medium size fit just fine. (It was labeled as medium on the actual dress tag). It hugged my curves without being overly stretched out."
"Arrived with a hole in it.  Material is much thinner than what is depicted in the picture.  I went up two sizes after reading the reviews and sizing guide, but that was not enough.  Disappointed."
Extremely disappointed at the amount of lint that this material collected from the first wash. I'm hating the pants totally because of this.
This product isn't even close to running true to size.  I returned it.
"Nice design, I liked it for the three weeks it held together. Then the carry handle ripped right out of the mounting point. The leather at the mounting point was tissue-paper thin.
I'm quite disappointed to have to return it.. It was bought on design, not price, so the poor quality is an annoyance, to say the least."
Not very happy with the product considering it was broken when I received it and there's no way to refund my money.
Don't fit like my usual 32s...
"Super short, super tiny even with the suggested size chart, and the bands across the front do not make the pattern in the picture."
I was very disappointed that I had to return these shoes for the unexpected reason that they were simply too wide.  I ordered a size 6W and the shoes fit like a 6.5WW!  I even checked the label to make sure I hadn't been sent a pair of size 9 by mistake.  There was no way I could walk in them unless I was wearing two pairs of thick socks.  I was so disappointed because the foam padding inside felt sturdy and comfortable.
Nothing to this.  It was sent back.
"I've developed holes in the heels of more than half of this pack of 6 socks in less then five months. I'm used to socks lasting way longer than that. They were very nice while they lasted, but I do not recommend them."
Not a slim at all more like a chubby.
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THE SIZE CHART IS NOT FOR AMERICAN GIRLS AND IT SHIPS FROM CHINA.
THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP AND THE PICTURE IS DECEIVING, I AM 5'2, 130 LBS AND THE MEDIUM IS WAY TOO SMALL"
"These shoes are really cute but, I had to return them because the left shoe was about 1/2 inch shorter than the right one.  Needless to say I couldn't wear them."
"This was my size, and I could never t understand why it was too large on my right foot."
I'm sad to give this item two stars because they are SUPER comfortable and a great fit. I bought them in the China Tea leather and really regret it - I've been wearing them for maybe a little over a week (and I actually only wear them while sitting at my desk at the office because my office is so cold) and already the leather is starting to peel off. Like I said - I only wear them sitting at a desk and have only had them 1-2 weeks. I'm not running around or beating them up so its sad that they are already showing serious signs of wear. I really wish I had bought the light brown suede material - those seem maybe more sturdy?
"They're made for extremely tiny people, I'm not big, 5'9"" weigh 120 pounds, wears size 4 but couldn't even fit size 10"
"This is a nice wet look dress, however runs small for small thin people. Very short. Was told that it ran long"
girlfriend dd not like them because they were to small and did not fit right.
Really cheap and sloppy looking blouse.
Silver turned my ears black on the first wear
Tiny!  The stone slips right thru my labret
The S Dada gray heather hoodie I received is far lighter than I expected... and its also 36 I didn't expect it to be tight... but according to the size chart - a small is 25-26  I was hOping it would be a bit more snug... a 10 difference is noteable...
Definitely only for use as a cover up.  One size fits UP TO a medium...not large or Xl.
"Very cheap, doesn't fit my head. Way to big"
"I ordered a 36D since a 34DD was not avaialbe (its the sister size) The straps were thin, I didn't feel supported. If I bent over everything seemed to ""fall out"". If I just don't move it was fine. I did not return only because I was over seas at the time. For chesty women this may not be the best."
Tight and narrow. Don't recommend it for somebody with wide feet.
Unfortunately they popped on the second day of wearing and they were not tight
They look cheap and kinda are. But they keep my feet warm and Im hoping theyll stretch out some
Buy a FEW sizes bigger than what you usually wear.
"Everything about this could be amazing BUT the zipper got the dress doesn't go low enough to open up the tightest part of the dress. So unless you are super skinny or the same size all around, you're not getting this on. I even got a medium and I'm 5'4.5"" and about 135. Couldn't get it over my shoulders put my bum so I had to return it :("
"There's nothing wrong with these underwear...

But if you're looking for brightly colored underwear that look sexy... these aren't it. More flattering shapes are available.

For inexpensive choices, Reebok and Jockey both make low-rise brief packs that I prefer to these. 2xist costs more but makes many nice things."
These are not D4 Dockers
"The website says it runs small and that's an understatement, it runs tiny. It also says 100% cotton, not! It's more like a nylon blend. Very disappointed and sent it back. Buyer BeWare!"
It's very very small and scratches easily. It's just not made well . However it is real silver but the craftsmanship is weak. I'm always afraid the heart charm or clasp will break.
My Diamonds are found out and the black come off the ring..
"I really wanted this boot, but it just doesnt fit right.  My toes feel smashed.  Going up a size won't work because the ankle area is too loose. It's just uncomfortable everywhere. So I will have to send these right back.

But if you're lucky enough to fit into them, they look fantastic.

And they are SUPER-lightweight, lighter than some tennis shoes."
I ordered these for my sisters birthday and within two weeks they had fallen apart :(  The straps pulled right out from the sole.
"I was expecting a low heeled boot and to my unhappy surprise, there is a 2 inch heel lift inside the boot.  So you are getting high-heeled boots, which I cannot wear due to having weak ankles.  What a disappointment.  They are great looking boots and I was so excited to wear them with my jeans, but instead I was fooled and crushed.  Fortunately they were cheap (and yes they are cheap) enough to throw them away.  I should have known there was something different about the product for it to be at such a low price.  The product description should include that there is a heel lift inside the boot, but it doesn't."
Very warm but these slide right down any time I walk up or down stairs or sit down
shoes arrived with some nasty looking stains all over just ONE of the shoes. Also these shoes have an odd number of lace holes on the same shoe one side 21 the other 22 and on the other shoe had 22 on each side. i have already put these in for refund. unfortunately my niece really really wants this style shoe so hopefully i will have better luck the second time around!!!
Cross fell off on both orders.  Very disappointing.  I would have liked to exchange mine for another but decided it was not worth the hassle.
Didn't work correctly.  I have several Invicta watches and this is the first time one has not worked correctly.
"i did not like the fit and was hoping the neckline would be a llittle loose, it feels like it is choking my neck!"
"Doesn't stick, after first use does not last on the skin."
Handle came apart and strap fell off in less than a week of use. Looks very nice but does not last.
"They were the right size, but they seemed cheaply made. Also the straps did not look very good around my ankles. There are definitely better sandals out there."
"2 stars for comfort only!
Durability is poor.  Within a month the stylized webbing [outermost criss-cross black layer on the top region of the shoe] has pulled loose in many areas.  Structurally, the shoe seems to care less about this issue.  Though the problems do not end there.  The fabric layer is weak and generated several holes on each shoe.

I was saddened to put these shoes aside.  They just looked too tattered and unprofessional to wear around any longer. They still had good soles and good fit but when they look like a lawnmower hit them once or twice its just not acceptable."
Sizing not right for American women.
"The dress bust area was way too large.  The over the shoulder strap was about 6 inches too long. You would need to wear it around your neck, not over the shoulder."
Fan does not work! Very glad that we tried it with brand new batteries the day it was delivered! Very disappointing.
Zipper busted after 3 wearings.  Pockets blown out--fabric separated from stitches.
"Okay, so I ordered with everyone's comments in mind that the shirt ran small.  I don't think anyone expressed just how small they are!!  My daughter wears a size 10/12 so I ordered much larger.  I got the XL.  Well, it's here and it says XL on the label but it would be equivalent to a SMALL (not even close to being a medium).  In women's dresses it would be about a size 0/2--yep, that small."
"These mittens left marks on my 2 month old baby's skin because the elastic was too tight around his wrist. I liked that the mittens are a little bit thicker than other ones because my baby has really cold hands at night, but sadly, I couldn't use them because I was worried that his circulation would be cut off. They are really soft and I really wanted to like them, but they were not good for my baby."
"While other reviewers complained of a baggy ankle, I thought I would give these boots a try anyway. The calf is on the narrow side, which is what I was looking for, but the ankle is oddly large. The leather is very soft, so even those the boots are new, the leather pools around the ankle for a very slouchy look; not my style."
"Personally, I do not care for the fit of these pants. I say try them out for yourself. they come up high and are not a slim fit. maybe I needed a smaller size but it did not seem that way."
I ordered a 2X. I can easily wear a 2X. The top was narrow and I could not get it over my head. I have NEVER seen a 2X this small and I am extrememly disappointed since I wanted these to layer in our very cold weather..I would caution anyone before orderering these. I certainly will not.
"My husband ordered this shirt for me in two different colors - the pink and the tan. He ordered both in size medium. The pink was true to color, but the tan was more gray-ish than shown. The sizing was what made me return both, however. The pink size medium was too large for me, and the tan size medium was too small. The shirts, though the same tag size, were VERY different sizes!"
Average to below average quality and fit.  I now purchase Ivivva products and they are well worth the extra $.
Color was a big disappointment - it was predominately a dark gray - and fit was too tight - sent it back - which I normally would not do on such a low price item.
The dress is poor quality. I will probably never wear it but it was so cheap its not worth the hassle to return. The neck line is much higher than pictured on the model
"I'm 5'9 and this fits like a tank top. The ribbon is plastic. It costs more to return, than I will get in a refund. Not worth it."
"It's kind of cute, but the globe is made to spin so it's not made well enough to keep the globe from falling off. I may try to use metal glue to hold it in place, but it won't spin anymore and is probably not worth the effort."
really lousy shape like old lady
I was disappointed in the thin material.
WAY WAY WAY OFF ON SIZES
The inside sole didn't feel comfortable
"Micro size, Paper thin. Waste of money."
"These ran really small, especially compared to the pleated style in the same size. Either order up a size or get the pleated pants."
The sizing is as expected but the straps are itchy so I am returning it.
"Weird fit, only for people with smooth skin everywhere....."
"They are reasonably comfortable but--especially for the $50 I paid for them--they are of terrible quality! After a month of light use, they looked like they were 5 years old! The insole curls up inside and the sole wore thin to a point where a hole is forming. Also, the black trim is flaking off, like it was just drawn on with Sharpie. Completely unacceptable!"
"They are stretchy, but hold their shape, comfortable and flattering.  I love them!
Update:
Since I ordered these 12/21/2016, the price has skyrocketed from $22 per pair to a now ridiculous price of $47 per pair as of 01/10/2017.  Any explanation as to why the price has more than doubled in less than 6 weeks??????"
"We got these sandals for my husband to replace his Spenco flip-flops that the dog chewed up. He has large, flat feet. He was looking for comfort and cushioning, and did not like the way these felt. He ended up sending them back and buying another pair of Spenco."
Stitching coming apart after one wash . Not good !
Ordered Asian-XL/US-M. But it was an Asian-XL/US-L  when it arrived.  Nice material though. Just gonna wash it with hot water and put it in the dryer a few times.
Not what I expected...I returned the product. Cheap look and feel.
"Cherokee are to me - and always have been very comfortable. No breaking in required. This pair started ""coming apart at the seams"". I had to use superglue to stick the sides back! I've had them about a month. I couldn't send them back - I needed the shoes for work and had already thrown out my old pair because I didn't expect these to start falling to pieces. Won't buy these again. Shame on you Cherokee."
"I'm 5'3"" & 160 lbs, the width can be taken in, but the length is way too long and cannot be adjusted. Leaving the pockets past my knees. If I carry my phablet in there its gonna break if I kneel. Also the product is not as pictured. In the picture they appear to be tapered from below the knees to the ankle, which is not the case. And the button was very loosely sewn on and the hole was too small, breaking off the first time buttoning up. If you want real cargo pants just buy from the local surplus, these are imitation, and not the greatest."
"Until I washed it, this camisole fit well and looked okay.  Now it is going in the trash can! After washing, the material looks as though it has hair ALL over it. I read a similar review from another customer. Cheap fabric; poorly made product. A complete waste of money."
Too small even though I bought as large as prescribed in the size guide.
These are not the smartwool socks with merino. They cant possibally be.
"I thought it would be larger than the picture, but when they arrived I noticed the exact opposite. Blings like the price you pay for it on here"
Nice looking shoe however way to narrow my husband couldn't get his foot into
Came out of the dryer all wrinkled.
very small. top didn't even near cover enough. had to send back
They didn't stick whatsoever. Terrible life and coverage. They were far too large and the pasties were extremely visible under clothing.
"Weird locket. It hangs funny and is hard to open. Very heavy, bulky"
This thing arrived strangely rigid and fragile. It broke in half as I was taking it out of the package. There is something very wrong with this product.
The 6E sizing was completely wrong. More like a 3E.
"don,t fit right. on waist.  it is cut to low for me.so."
"I really wanted to like these sandals, since I'm a barefoot/VFF kind of guy.  They do feel very good on the feet in terms of having a thin yet durable sole.  Maybe it's just me, but getting them to fit right was a nightmare.  The big toe strap is pretty tight, and I simply could not find a way to adjust the straps so as not to get horrible chaffing and blisters.  I tried loose, I tried tight, I tried a compromise between the two... The material they make the straps out of really just loves to hit the wrong spot and rub until you have to take them off.  I've tried wearing them on different occasions to let my foot heal, sure enough same result.  As a side note I was not very tough on these.  For the positives they are very lightweight, flexible and packable... all great attributes however if you can't wear the sandal they are useless."
"Pretty style but the smallest size is way too large. I am running into this a lot with Asian clothing companies lately. I guess they went overboard trying to cater to the ""big"" American market, and if you are actually small you're out of luck. Please offer in x-small or xx-small?"
its not like the photo
"When I ordered these the listing said they had shelf bras, but I just received them, none have a shelf bra, and now the entire listing has been changed-photographs and text. They'll be fine for layering or around the house, but they have adjustable straps and having to wear a bra underneath is going to be an extra pain. Not sure if I'll keep or not. Really shady."
"The heel is too wide, they won't stay on and the color is not even close to the photo. They are an ugly gray/tan color."
The cut at the bottom is horrible. I would suggest only someone without curves to purchase.
don't like the gold chain on the beads.
"The neck opening was ridiculously huge and looked very weird.  Nothing at all like the photo.  It is made of a strange snaggy fabric similar to a child's pajamas, and is way too tight.  I ended up sending this back - totally useless."
FIts really small for any girl with hips
I have a large leg muscle and these socks are too small.  I can't imagine these fitting any man.
"Shirt is very cheaply made does not look like the pic, made from very thin shiny spandex material. Does not look like the pic."
Cheap cheap cheap.... zipper broke after only a few months.  Good thing I bought 2.
"COLOR WAS not the same as the ""royal"" blue pants I ordered that were Cherokee."
not comfortable....cute though
These leggings are almost as see through as panty hoes and they arrived already with a hole in them. Not too impressed but you get what you pay for I suppose.
These shoes are odd looking when on. They look like they could have potential but really you'd have to want to have somewhere cool to wear these. I have small ankles so these were way to big!
"I hate how wide they are on my calves, and I have pretty big calves."
"I have worn many Stacy Adams shoes and have been happy with the quality for the price-point.  This is the first pair I have purchased that creek / squeak when I walk in them (more of a creek than a squeak).  Its almost like the wood sole has a defect or somehow moves against the rubber.  Maybe they are knock-offs or a defective pair, but not happy with them."
"I was not happy, wrong sizes"
"Way huge, would have to jam pack it for it to stand up. Hated how the shorter handles could not be removed if I wanted to use the longer strap. Sending it back. Too bad, it's super cute and seemed like it would be pretty durable."
Too small. Uncomfortable.
Not good at all. It gave me stomach ache
Bag is very cheap looking. It's functional
Broke almost immediately
"I ordered 2 sizes above the size my daughter wears. Two of the bras fit her. One of the bras, even though they are same size as the first two, was super tight and cant be worn. Ill just buy them from the local store next time."
"Too small.. I should've paid close attention to the measurements. It'll do but not what I was expecting at all. It does have the 3 compartments and looks exactly as the picture shows , color and all. It's okay just really small."
"Certainly not the best quality tap shoe out there. Very cheaply made..not very supportive and comfortable, but they're okay for a junkie pair to just practice in."
I bought this watch about a year ago and I loved it. But it started falling apart. The bars holding the links together were breaking and others were starting to fall out. (And this wasn't a watch I wore daily. I don't wear much gold so I maybe wore this 3-5 times a month.) But I liked it enough to buy another one. This time I'm disappointed. It doesn't even work. The knob used to set the time doesn't stay in place and doesn't press in so the watch never starts. Hopefully the company will resolve this and I'll update my review (again) accordingly.
Narrower than advertised.
BUTTONS FELL OFF IMEDIATELY !!!!!
"They were to good to be true.
- Great price
- Cool Colors and that's about it

They are sown so poorly that it is like putting on a spiderweb. You have to strategically fit your feet through all the thread.
They don't stay up and they look very baggy and saggy due to how poorly sown.

I wouldn't recommend them. I wouldn't pay for them. I will keep them and where them when I forget to do laundry for a month. . . if that ever happens."
"It is a beautiful shirt, but it runs REALLY small. I ordered the largest size, an 18, which is two sizes up from what I usually wear. It arrived sooner than expected (about 10 days after ordering). The shirt fits like a size 8/10. I will have to return it or gift it to someone who can wear it."
"Loved the look of the shoe, but couldn't get my foot in them.  They are supposed to be wide width, I don't think so.  Very disappointed."
Rolls up. Will not stay down ! Pain in the butt....
"Even if this would have fit or been true to any sizing, I'd still give it two stars. I've been asking for a refund/return for a while and I haven't heard  anything from them. They haven't been very kind in their communications and the jacket is fairly flimsy. I'm unimpressed"
very thin at the closer and it bends so easily and makes it too loose.
"The only good thing about this blouse/shirt, the material is soft. These shirt/blouse are very poorly made, I will be returning them ASAP. I do not recommend purchase of these blouse/shirt."
Felt cheap. As if they would break in less than a few months of use.
Not as depicted too small ripped as soon as I adjusted it very flimsy material cheap unflattering
"If you have a large booty... I suggest two sizes bigger. Plus, its way too short."
Very small and somewhat flimsy!
Too small and fabric is scratchy.
"Sewn-in slip under dress is extremely short. I'm 5'8 & the slip does not cover my buttocks, posing a huge problem since the dress is sheer.  This was my second purchase of this dress because I wanted it to work since it's so pretty, but just like the first that I returned, this one had the same problem of the slip being too short. I thought since there were other reviews from tall women that it would be okay, but it wasn't. For reference, I am 36 bust, 32 waist, 46 hips, & wear a size 12/14 in dresses. I tried two different sizes in this dress. Both were loose & flowy as expected, but did not cover my backside. I'm pretty sure I read other reviews from women that were a bit curvier than me that the dress fit fine, so maybe the peach dress style is defective."
I really like the comfort and ease of tying the laces but the stitching on the both side are coming apart in several places after only a few wearings. Very poor quality in workmanship for the price. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!
"This is one of the most uncomfortable shoe I tried.  Of course this is a personal opinion.  I can wear most shoes fine, but I did not feel enough cushion (insole) compared to most other shoes.  This shoe looks, feels and fits more like my hiking boots, but much less comfortable.  It was ok when I used a gel insole, but why should I?  I have returned this and found others that are much better."
WAY TO BIG!
These are on the large side. Strange fit. They are cute but seem poorly made.
Not worth the 10.99 I paid. Will be returning. Looks cheap and the yellow is like a burnt yellow not the sunny yellow I was expecting
"Bought these in the same size as the MT20 v1 and they were comically large. Forgot to return them, so now I'm stuck. Maybe if I have another mid-life growth spurt (year right).

A shame. I'd order down.  Can't speak to how long they will last but the material does seem flimsy."
"The concept for this device makes sense and I bought it because of the good reviews. However, I have used this device only 3 times and have had to replace the battery twice (I've only owned it for 6 months). It's crazy to think that it goes through that much battery when the same CR2032 battery can last my calculators with moderate use 3-5 years. I guess I could take the battery out each time but then that becomes inconvenient and I'd be likely to lose the battery when I needed it. I'd suggest just avoiding this brand altogether."
This necklace is smaller than usual and I did not really like it. I was a cheap little stone that i felt I could have got it on a coin machine prize. Not worth it and very cheap material. You get what you pay for...
Fell apart after a few months. Maybe even one month.
Very bad wig definitely is not worth the money. Horrible pulse it is NOT a lace front at all! Definitely look somewhere else. Very bad wig!!!
One of these earrings broke straight out of the box.
"The dress is fine, though not as nice as the picture. The problem is the size is WAY off.  I wear a 22, bought a 3X (22/24) and got a maybe 16/18, though it says 3X on the label."
Way too big for my liking. Pretty tho!
"I just got these for my 2.5 yo 2 weeks ago for forest days/outdoor activities at daycare. I wanted rain pants that were not a bib style for easy quick on/off since he is potty trained.  After 1 wash per the washing instructions and air dry, the weatherproof strip in the inside of the pants that go over the seam is peeling off. So no i'm not sure how waterproof these will be from now on.  For the $29 retail price I feel really really disappointed in the quality of these pants.  We have a pair of rain bibs I got for $8 that have withstand much better.  Will not be buying another Hatley brand item."
"First let me say that the dress does NOT look like the picture!! It took a long time to arrive and when it finally arrived, I was very DISAPPOINTED!! I ordered an extra large when I wear a large and it was too small across the shoulders.  There is no way this style of dress can sit off the shoulders as pictured!! The material used is VERY THIN!! I'm talking "" satin pillow case thin!!!"" I ordered this dress in black and it looks like a high low MESS!! The dress is long in the back and short in the front true, but that's about the only thing that is true about it. The sizing issue between US sizing and Asian sizing continues to be a problem!! I am not hard to please and a lot of things I buy I keep even if it's a little "" off"" on the description but this really was BAD!!  I will not buy from this seller again!!"
Very tight straps on the front when I take them off the strap has molded into my skin. Also they are very similar in style to Birkenstock sandals which aren't attractive in my opinion. Not very comfortable.
The robe is great!  But very disappointed in PJ's  The first time they were washed they faded some and got bumpies all over them.
"There is so much potential here, however the quality was so poor. The v neck front was sewn unevenly leaving the ""v"" to sag on one side instead of center. The shoulder straps were also uneven, making the appearance much worse and the poor sewing more noticeable. Though inexpensive, I was disappointed."
"Slippers that cover your calves. I have cold calves. I did remove the tie-dyed thingy with the beads. That was just annoying after about the first 2 minutes of wearing as they quickly became cat toys. I'm pretty sure the cats are trying to kill us so removing any lures from your clothing is always a good idea. The sole is rubber so you can walk outside and not worry about wet feet, always a bonus. The interior foot bed is soft memory foamish type stuff, nice and squishy - in a good way. I'm wearing them right now, my feet are happy. The cats love them too, like little scratching posts that move. Basically if you're looking for comfortable slippers that cover your calves and are cute, these will work. Unless you don't think they're cute, then you should probably look at something else.

Updated as of Feb. 18, 2016 -  I do like the colors and height of the top portion but the quality is just awful. These slippers lasted just under one season - they are disposable footwear in a disposable society. What was I thinking?! I loved that the souls were rubber, you can wear them outside to grab the mail or feed a stray cat. Nope. Don't try it. The soles are falling off, I taped them with gorilla tape to no avail. Once the glue that holds that synthetic suede band around the bottom of the boot gets any sort of moisture on it, forget it. And that foamish interior- ew. It's so gross. It feels cold and weird but that's probably from all the air flow I now get under my feet because of the gapping holes in the soles. The photo is the slipper, not a fish gasping for air.

And now for a valuable life lesson many of us tend to ignore: You get what you pay for."
the design is very modern and material looks cool. but it was written it was made from steel though I have an irrtation in my skin. so at the end I could not use this watch. I had to give it away
"I am 5'5"" and 130 pounds and the Large is too small for me.  The pants fit good but the shirt is very short and semi-snug.  The light color stains easily and these are very thin pajamas.  It's a waste of Pepsi Points but at least I didn't pay cash for them.  Too bad they're out of stock of the XL's which is probably the size everyone wears with these small sizes."
"Fabric is scratchy and very thin, I do not recommend."
"I really dislike this product. Looks cheap and not worth the money. I should have read the reviews because I was expecting it to be bigger, not half and inch. The chain is very thin and  so badly knotted that after great frustration I broke the chain. One of my poorer internet purchases."
"I suppose these are great for some people, but I have picky feet. I could hardly stand up in them, much less go for a ""country walk""."
"Cute PJs.. however, I ordered a 2t and the pants seem like they are actually 12 months."
Too wrinkly!
"Not even worth the penny, I just don't see what everyones raving about. These are the most fakest looking earrings. However I'm not upset for they was only a penny. Everyone knows you get what you pay for. Not at all sparkly and shiny, they are big and they look very unreal. I turned around and ordered the MYIA PASSIELLO ""Essentials"" Swarovski Zirconia 1 Carat Each Round Stud Earrings. These earrings are amazingly beautiful, shiny, sparkly, you can't go wrong with these and you won't be disappointed! The real deal"
Not what I expected. It's a kid size.
"Inferior quality. Fabric had multiple flaws. This appears to be printed on a flimsy gauze. Fabric feels slippery, very plastic-like. Got as a gift for my granddaughter, but will be returning it as it is very tacky and not worth more than a dollar or two. I also have concerns about it's flammabilty as it seems like any source of ignition would make it burst into flames. Irritates me that I even have to pay postage to return the stupid thing. Normally wouldn't bother but this think is such junk, I wouldn't give it to anybody or use it myself."
"The others reviews made it sounds like a beautiful piece of jewellery, so i ordered it but i must say im disappointed. Its rather cheap looking and i doubt ill ever wear it. Too expensive for what it is. Sorry!"
way too big and very floppy. They look nice but comfort level for me was not what I expected. A smaller size would not made the toe. Not thrilled on the fit.
"not what was expected, too tight and not very comfortable sent them back"
"Cute , but looks nothing like the pictures."
Looks like a nightgown
"Very disappointed I received the wrong product. Ordered the all black pump as pictured above and received black pump with white platform and heel. Not at all what I wanted! Package came way ahead of schedule, which I was so excited about, only to open it and find the wrong item."
A WASTE OF MONEY
"I work in the US textile industry and I was very excited to see a US made hat, but multiple dropped stitches in the sweat band is unacceptable. I understand running the band though a folder and a double needle chainstitch but an inspector should have flagged this right away."
"I had to return these. I have a pair of wide calf boots with a zipper and they're snug against my legs, which I prefer. These arrived and were way too big (I would order a size down) and the calf section was HUGE, and I'm a wide calfed gal. Plus I am short so the tops were way over my knees. Just not my style."
way to small and there was no free returns so I just gave it away
I liked the material but the size was unbelievably HUGE !!! It looks like a 3x plus size. I kept it anyway and I am going to try to find someone to give it to. Maybe Hulk Hogan......
"Order same size as before, but no fit"
too busy
"I bought a size Med for my husband who wears normally a small.  I got the larger size in case of shrinking, and it was still too small.  He could barely get the pant leg over his foot.  I recommend going a size and a half to two up."
"Loved this outfit-as expected. It has bright, vibrant colors. Can't wait to see my son in it! It's super cute!
I had to edit my review. When I went to put this on my baby, as I opened the first snap, it popped off and flew across the room somewhere. It almost appeared as if it had been glued on or something. That's really crappy for baby clothes and I'm sure it's a safety hazard. I'll never buy Bumkin brand again."
These gloves are really sized for women. I can't imagine an average sized man being able to wear them. I returned them for credit.
"Saggy and faded after a few washes, don't waste your money"
With the first wash the small tab for the clasp inside the zipper area came off on the first wash. The pads inside the cups slide around during work outs. Support is pretty minimal. Overall not that impressed.
VERY cheap and very hot.
"I got these during a Black Friday lightning deal (AKA feeding frenzy) so I did not look very closely at the description.  Had I read the description and looked closer at the photo I would have avoided making the purchasing mistake.  The fault was mine, but I gotta say, Amazon was terrific about the return, and took them back quickly and without drama.

What was my mistake?  Well, first of all, let me say that for my 18 yr old college daughter, if they were pink hearts, she would probably love them.  There is a nice white crystal at the top of the earring, and the pink heart has kind of a clear plastic ""gem"" over the heart to give it some added dimension.  My problem was that I did not see the ""Kiss"" and XoX"" gold lettering prominently pasted on top of the clear plastic gem.  They don't match, and the ""Kiss"" and XOX stick out like a cheap tie tack on a silk tie.  They make the whole set look like the kind of jewelry you get from a vending machine.  If you take some time, and look at the photos, you will see what I mean, and you can decide for yourself."
Didn't like the shoe
"I am reliably 34c, and this band felt at least a size tighter. The cups were very wide as well, so while this is ""wearable"" it's not flattering. I'm looking for another smooth racerback bra to wear under tanks."
"I'm typically a 34DD and pre-pregnancy have probably been spoiled with my VS bra's. In general I feel like 1-2 good bra's are a wardrobe staple worth paying a little more for. However, the temporary nature of pregnancy makes it hard to splurge (at least for me). I wasn't really sure what to expect from this bra since it's fairly cheap but it seemed to get pretty good reviews and of course cost doesn't always determine quality. I needed something more comfortable since I can't handle underwires anymore. I bought a medium (based on other reviewers who indicated they wear the same bra size as me and we're happy with the fit of the M) for me, the band fits ok but the cups are a little on the small side - which means the front cross is lower than how it fits the model & it's cleavage city. If I had to do over, I probably would have tried a large & just pinned or shortened the band (& maybe added a stitch to the cross). It's a fairly comfortable bra and the bra itself looks cute but it creates an unnatural and unflattering chest shape (kind of a pancake boob shape) obvious when wearing both fitted and lose tees. I know maternity bras are more for comfort than style but I might as well go bra less for all the support this one offers.  Pretty sure a larger size would not fix that. I guess if you're just planning to sleep in it maybe that wouldn't really matter (although it bugs me) but I wouldn't recommend for daytime use (which is actually why I bought it). And for those who were expecting a nursing bra - I don't see any indication this one was designed with that in mind. Still pregnant so that doesn't apply to me yet but this one has pretty much gone straight to the goodwill pile. I personally am not satisfied with it, don't see it working in the future and don't think it's a good buy."
Size unexpectedly small
"I bought these b/c I have wide feet w/ bunions. (Genetic ones, not b/c of heels or improperly fitted shoes.) I am only 35 and wanted something cute, but in a wide width. I am a true size 8, so that's what I ordered. THEY WERE  HALF SIZE TOO BIG. I re-ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfectly length wise.

The navy blue color is really pretty. It's so dark that it would easily go with a black top and jeans or khakis. It was a great versatile color! I loved that the shoes were adjustable at the wide parts of the feet, ankle, and heel. The foot bed seemed nice and squishy.

The problem was that the strap that adjusts the width of your foot doesn't cover my bunions. It sits higher up, towards the toenails. Every time I took a step, the strap's bottom cut into the top of my bunion and pinched it. From looking at the picture, I thought it would cover my bunions and therefore be perfect, but nope. If Clarks would move the strap more towards the ankle by .25 - .5 inch, this shoe would be perfect.

As it was, I could make the toe strap really loose, and make the other 2 straps really tight. But, for a $50 shoe, I didn't want to have to MAKE a shoe work that might have a floppy toe box. I sadly sent it back. The search for a cute summer sandal that doesn't look like a 90 year-old's shoe continues..."
"Closing chain broke on 1st use so not a good product for me although having elephants laying on the counter makes me partially happy. Would not buy again due to quality but again, you get what you pay for."
Return it too big
Is not the actual size stated. Too small. Being an A line it's still too small. Be honest about your sizes or get out the business of catering to plus size people.
"Extremely poor quality.  These shoes fell apart in 1 week of normal wear.  I ordered these for my son, he wore them for normal day use - not for hiking or exercising, just walking for a few hours!  The bonding is very poor and came apart in a few days.  Don't waste your money!"
"I ordered a size Large, which I wear comfortably.  These were super tight and I'm guessing would have shrunk when I washed them.  I also thought the straps were chintzy.  They were ribbon-like, which wasn't in itself a reason for me to return them. However, they were the length I was looking for."
Order a size up they run very small. Very thin and cheaply made. Was not happy with my purchase at all.
These are somewhat of a disappointment.  They have literally no cushion in them if that's something you are needing.  I had to put inserts in them to get any feeling of support.  Also these are completely man made materials on the uppers and lowers.  I think for the price they are really cheap and the uppers arent' flexible since they are made of something that resembles cardboard.  No kidding.
"The fringe is ""melted"" onto the original hoop.  The pattern loses its shape in that area.  The fringe was also not centered on one of the earrings. The size and style is nice but I was really looking forward to these. I will still wear them with my hair down to hide the flaws but they're not really all I had hoped for."
"The shoes would actually fit, I llove her brand, if only there was a zipper on the inside they would go off or on easier. I will have to return these for that reason,  sorry to say, 4 pairs"
They are functional pants.  This is the third pair I have purchased.  I got these because my black pair had faded in a very weird way.  I ordered 38/30 (the size of my other pants).  The tag says 38/30 but the pants are 40/30.  I guess they make them too fast.  I have to decide to ship them back or get them hemmed - neither one of which I want to do.  Will not purchase again.
What a cheap see through dress.
"Purchased ""red cat"" print and received white with colored polka dots. Red cat is clearly stated on my order details. Normally I would have returned them and asked for the correct product, but I was giving them to a good friend at a Christmas party that I attended over the weekend. I didn't have the time to wait for the correct ones. The sad thing is my friend is obsessed with cats and the color red and had asked on her card for pj pants. So of course the right product would have been perfect. The gift was significantly less meaningful since she isn't a fan of polka dots. Won't be buying from this company again."
"Thanks very much to the reviewer who wrote ""I wore them a few times and each time they stretched out more and more to the point that my feet were sliding around in them"". I got these sandals in the same color the reviewer had. After trying them on and swooning over how gorgeous and comfortable they are, I noticed that the leather straps are so soft, I wondered if they would stretch out to the point that my toes would slide out the front when I walked in them. Reading her and several others' reviews, it seems very likely that would happen, so I'm regretfully returning these sandals. Long ago I had a pair of platform sandals where my toes slid out the front with every step. It was annoying and dangerous, and I'm keen to avoid that problem again!

PS - Maybe the strap across the toes needs a buckle like the other straps, needs to be angled differently or just needs to be reinforced or less stretchable. I'll be watching to see if and how Jambu improves this style."
These are really small.  my son could not get them comfortably into his earlobe
It fit really weird. I don't have a torso (I'm all legs) but this fit really short in the torso.
"The sizing seemed about right and the appearance of the shoe was good, but my wife complained that the fit was terrible.  She complained that the front of the shoe pinched in at her toes and the arch support was not acceptable.  We ended up having to return the boots."
"The top part is nice and opaque, but the bottom short tore along the side seam the first time I wore it. Save your money on this dress."
Good belt but the metal edges are a bit cheap. The metal end broke off on the second use.
The material kind of didn't look as crisp as I had hoped... you can tell it is 100% polyester  but if it had fit I think it would be cute regardless.  It ran big compared with other skirts I have bought on amazon
"The shoes look very nice and I was very excited when I received the package. But soon I dicovered that the straps have too much slack, they hang loose what diminishes the beauty of the shoes. I ordered a size 8.5 what is my exact size but the shoes fit like an 8. Sadly I'm going to return them today."
"These are awful. As others have written, they are coarse, scratchy, and non-absorbent. It's hard to believe they are cotton. I have other Hanes briefs (white) that I bought from s**'s cl*b. They are infinitely nicer. These are going to Goodwill."
I didn't order this - had to return.
"The belt I received was neither reversible nor made out of leather. It was brown and ""synthetic leather"".  So my review would be zero stars if I could give it."
Bought for my daughter to wear at Disney World.  Tried breaking them in prior but she ended up with awful blisters from them.
"Very uncomfortable for my high arches.  It feels like I'm walking on concrete.  Pretty though.  I wouldn't take a walk in these, but I might use them at the pool or gym shower."
"It was less bra and more lingerie. The page descrip made me think I could wear it as an actual bra, but it had no support. Pretty though and fit fine, and came on time."
"I ordered the Sun Amber & Brown Amber earrings and the colors are identical.
I double checked the information that came with the earrings and it says they are different colors but they are not."
Size Large? Sheesh... not even. A size large is about a size 6-8. It was cute however just sized completely wrong.
"Cheaply made. Broke in half the first time I used it, which unfortunately was after the 30 day return period."
I ordered a Junior size 7 and received a kids size 7.
"Ive had these flip flops for 2 weeks and the ROXY letters have already started peeling off on the top. Ive had other similar flip flops by ROXY for YEARS, and have never had this happen!"
Looks cute in the picture but cheap in person and not cute at all. Wouldn't recommend this.
Way too small.  Returned it.
"I purchased these briefs for my husband, who has been wearing Hanes underwear for years. Granted, the last time we purchased his undies was several years ago, but when he pulled the new briefs from their packaging, they looked pretty large. He checked the size... it said medium, so we got the right package. Then he compared them to his old Hanes briefs, and they were a good inch wider across the waist and hips than his old ones. Also, they're much baggier in the support area. We're not happy at all with the fit of these briefs. The only good things I can say are that the cotton material is soft and seems to be good quality, and the colors in the package were nice. (Hence the two stars instead of one star.)"
They are warm and the service was fast. However i have only worn them about 5 times and the velcrow is already falling off.  I have payed less for gloves i have had for years :(
Size wasn't to much of an issue. But the fit was terrible pour design it set down to low in front.
"I really like this watch a lot.  I like it so much that this is the 4th one I have bought.  When I replaced each watch, it was because the case was getting a little beat up (I am hard on watches).  The batteries started showing signs of getting a little weak after about 3 to 4 years for each watch, which I think is pretty darn good.  My favorite part of the watch is the watch band.

Update: The batteries in the 2 watches I bought online here in July 2013 died after less than 6 months.  These must be from a very old stock since the batteries usually lasted about 4 years in the same model watch I bought at a local store, and the battery for the one I bought here in January 2010 is also still good (but the watch buttons quit working... it had a rough life).  I am now using this old battery in one of the new watches."
I was about to return these but I figured out how to release/open it. Still it is very hard and I don't like it. It almost hurts my fingers.
"Dont dry this shirt. When heated, the lettering sticks to itself ripping off part of the logo everything it goes through the dryer"
"Not happy with these at all. The fabric was cheap and actually slimy feeling and it was way too large. The pockets make your hips look like, well, a hippo. I have size 34"" hips and I looked huge in them. I wouldn't even donate them to charity. I tossed them. I ordered two of these, one for my granddaughter and one for me because the pictures look so cute and all of my other PJ purchases on Amazon have been so great, but I do not recommend these at all!"
I wanted a  thick sole for my house shoes.  They were just too heavy and a little big.  I bought the 9M but they are wide.  I gave them to my niece who loves them.
"Had to return them.  They're re cheaply made, ill fitting"
Size 12-13 will not fit a size 10 1/2 foot.
"The look of this shoe is really great, but the foot tends to pitch forward missing the arch supports as they are intended.  I have adjusted the straps but that doesn't seem to help.  I can wear them for most of the day, but they are not as comfortable as my other orthoheel shoes."
Would have been better with a bit more elastic on the bottom of the  band. Feel like i might slip out the bottom. And i'm a D cup
The jeggings would have been fine but once again the fit of the top of the pants vs. the leg ratio was off and it looked like i had a diaper on.  cut weird and didn't fit.
Nice size but poor quality...it's going back.
Waste of money completely see through
too cheap for the money -returned it
returned. not as good as it looked on the screen.
"I love Dan Post boots and normally they are high quality, great fit.  I just bought the Black Cherry finish.  I worked them ONE TIME! They developed cracks in two hours!  The cracks are along the vamp and parallel to the sole.  I'm Sending them back.  Wish I could exchange for another pair. Very disappointed."
"very, very thin & fragile"
These look like plastic. They're really very cheaply made and uncomfortable.
"these have NO  support in the sole  & are very cheap made  guess that's the price was so low, U get what u pay for which is the bare minimum materials !!"
These didn't fit as they should.  They had an exaggerated hip line and the fabric was very scratchy.  Returned them.  Really unfortunate as the 525s are my favorite style other than 501s.
Not worth the money.  Floppy soles.  I'd rather go barefoot. They ended up in the donate bag within 1 week.
This was too small. I returned it.
Its too big and long!!
they are beautiful but you get what you pay. I only was able to use it for a couple of hours and had to take them off.
"I was disappointed and sent this garment back.  I am rather short and the fit was not right for me.  It rolled down and did not pull my tummy in.  The quality of the material seemed good, and it might work for some people, just not for me."
"I have 2 of these skirts and love them...one black and one print.  I ordered a dark gray and red....they aren't even the same skirt.  These last skirts came from China!!  They are mid calf, A-line, and have a tie at the waist.  Does this picture look anything like the skirt described??"
Love glass but broke in one hour of use of use them  couldn't enjoy that at all .... Update.  Yea. Tree hit. Replace my. Sunglasses that broke and now there  great as before
"Product not as heavy as I expected and color was too bright, picture shows more navy in color, had to reorder from another seller to get a true navy.  This will get sold at my next garage sale."
Shirts are of varying sizes and all too short. Poor quality print for design. Would not purchase this item again.
I got the largest size and it fits appropriately up top but is too tight around the hips. The slit runs up quite high which looks weird. If you have curves this isn't a great dress.
"As I said before, the thing was defective. It had blurred or rippled lenses causing double vision and this thing is really dark, I've never seen sunglasses so dark."
"This jacket is cute. I've walked in the rain and stayed dry except the hood obviously not waterproof. Downside, its stiiiiink. Had it for a while and the smell is still there."
"This brand shoe is not true to width in ANY style-period.  So, if you wear a narrow shoe, forget even trying the brand.  The problem is exacerbated with this particular style because of the V-shaped opening on the top of the shoe.  I so wish they did make true-to-width shoes because their styles are cute, although I do have to say that the heel on this shoe looked cheap."
The socks fit nice but are very thin and slippery in your shoes. I would not buy again
"Normal a size 10-12, ordered an XL and it was ridiculously small"
well made and provides good support but the cup is shaped pointy! not flattering at all.
Some of you women look a hot mess & should be embarrassed. Lol.
"This shirt was a disappointment.  It is really thin.  I was going to return it, but since it is a little big I can wear it over a turtleneck or other shirt. The material does feel nice so I decided to keep it."
Show was cut at least 1/2 size too short.
Wanted to cry after wearing them during a double.
"WAAAAY too heavy and way too bulky in the middle, but the bust fit. Just an odd jacket in my opinion. Normally wear an 8 wanted a little room so got the small. It was gigantic in the stomach area so much I could pull it out about 10 inches at least. I washed it with all my white uniforms hoping it would shrink and I just should have returned it. It came out of the wash a slight pink tinge color and none of my other white uniform vests or pants did?? Go figure.. size is very strange and fabric is VERY heavy."
"Very unhappy with this product.  They said that the shorts ran small ,so I ordered TWO SIZES BIGGER AND THEY WERE STILL VERY SMALL. They fit my niece and she is twelve and very small for her age. I am not happy at all."
I'm verrrrry upset cuz I wore it today and it isn't WARM enough.  The temps were in the 30's today and the WIND was blowing which made it even COLDER.  AND it's only FALL not WINTER.  What is it going to be like when IT'S IS WINTER???
Fits almost 1 fill size smaller.
"Described as large , really was a medium . Not flattering cut /design. Looks like what it cost . Not keeping returning."
"These are not for the avid traveler. They didn't even last two years and are basically disposable. Wheels malfunction and cannot bare any weight. What's the point of being expandable when the wheels give in under any weight? Do yourself a favor and spend more money for a quality product that will last. I have to buy a whole new set after two years and only 6 trips with the medium size one and 10 with the carryon size. As of now, both the carryon size and the medium size are difficult to maneuver and take excessive force to be pulled. So disappointed."
they hurt my balls. (too much compression)
"Hoodie is small, short, box shaped and not fitted.... tight around shoulders and square in the waste. Not worth the purchase unless below $5."
"A boyfriend jean is cut square and roomy thru the seat and thigh and hit just below belly button.  These are high wasted, not roomy...another take on ""mom jeans"". A rolled cuff and distressing do not a boyfriend jean make.

Try Vintage America boyfriend for a true fit."
"The photo is cute, but the product is not.  It is a weird, terrible, cheap material.  I waffled back and forth on keeping it because it's cute off the shoulder, but the material is so awkward that it is just not comfortable to wear - I wish I had returned this."
"the Ecco women's shoes in a range of sizes with no luck, and Amazon has been very responsive to our returns requests."
These are quite slippery and fit tight by the pinky toe which can rub. I keep wearing them hoping it will wear but they ache for sure...
Had to return it...had a very uncomfortable seam in the heel area.
"Fit normally, but a little sheer and less thick then I hoped they'd be. Champion makes the best opaque leggings IMO."
Adorable but too small for my four year old. Go three sizes up
Order a size down if you want this. The thing that comes with it is also very cheap. Order something else similar as this isn't what is pictured.
"Disappointed because this is not the quality expected of Birkenstock. Material is hard plastic, unforgiving and unnatural in feel. Sent back for refund."
"I've always worn the encore sole and love them.  This pair however was slightly too short and tight.  When I tried a 1/2 size larger they were sloppy.  I just couldn't get used to them.  These are so great looking until you put them on and then...blah.
come on Merrell bring back the sport...simple and sporty"
"Very very small. I wonder if they aren't shipped in different sizes. It is VERY short, comes up above my bellybutton. That model must weigh 80 lbs because no way does it drape like that. Disappointed."
"These arrived on time and were packaged well. However, they do run small and on one shoe, the grommets along one side were not secured to the shoe and slid right up the shoe laces. These shoes were returned."
"Cute as can be on, but arrived with a large brown stain on the front. Washed it and the stain remains."
Heavy and poorly made.
"I bought 3 different ones. I really liked the first pair, but the lenses sometimes fall out. The 2nd pair was OK. The 3rd (blue) are way too tight."
Too small not even close to an average extra large
They came very fast. Bought them for my bf. He said they were cut funny.
Not soft at all I had to wash them 4 times so they could be used on my glasses. There still worthless. It's literally worse material than a bandana.
Machine grease on the purse.  It spread to the dress.  It is a mess. I cannot believe that quality control let it through! I am beyond disappointed.
"Threads started coming out on the first wear and continue to come out with each wash.

8-month update: The waistbands are starting to separate from the rest of the material due to the now numerous missing threads."
This did not fit. It pulled up around the breast line. I had it altered twice and then threw it away
I opened the first of 2 packs I ordered to realize that size 10 was equivalent to a 3x. Order 2-3 sizes smaller.
"So disappointed in this sweater. Nothing at all like in the picture.  It looks as if I tried knitting it myself. Did come faster than expected,  but I will never wear it it is mis-shaped and very loose knit with holes. I was so excited to see the pkg on the doorstep then I opened it and its not even the size I ordered."
I bit disappointed that  I had this braclet for about a month and it is already discolored.
Way weird fit!  I sent it back.
"I got a size 8, which is my usual size, but I couldn't even pull these on.  I couldn't get it to go over my instep, and I tried with both hands.  I am disappointed, because I love the color, and I had a pair of these before that were wonderful.  I'm afraid a size 9 would be too big, though..."
"Very thin material. I bought the white one and you can see right through it! I wore a nude bra to match my skin, but you can see every detail of my bra! :("
could not fit a child of 11 years old that wears a size child 12
"This sandal looks and feels cheap. It also runs quite narrow through the toe strap. All around, very disappointed with the sandal."
PURCHASED THESE AS A GIFT FOR A MAN WHO WEARS SIZE 13 SHOE.  THEY WERE SO SMALL & TIGHT HE COULDN'T EVEN GET THEM COMFORTABLY OVER HIS FEET LET ALONE THE HEEL & UP THE CALF.  THEY APPEAR TO BE OF DECENT QUALITY MATERIAL & WORKMENSHIP
"Left shoe fit perfectly and was very comfortable but the righet shoe fit as though it was 1/2 size too large. I did return them for that reason. The shoe itself is great,  just seems to be an error on the size.  I did replace  them with another size.  Love Bob's shoes."
"I loved these shoes, but, unfortunately, the soles are very slippery.  I now only wear them as water shoes for wading in the creek!"
"These socks could definitely be better. The elastic in the material is not up to the job. The top of the tube would stretch comfortably onto the ankle and calf, and the foot of the sock was too big in relation to the shaft, so it stayed loose. The one thing that I did like about these socks were the vibrancy of the colors. The graphics were very pronounced and poppy. That being said, clothing items should fit properly, which these are not made of good enough material to meet that expectation. Would not get again.

I received this product at a discount for an unbiased review."
Ordered 2E width but shoes are marked W. They are not 2E! Had to return.
Not what I expected but ok for the price
"They fit, but, when I put them on (I was leaving town and had no other pair to wear), I noticed a hole in the leg. New jeans should not have holes in them."
"The price seemed fair,  but the cross and the infinity symbol both broke off the chain after wearing for a  short while.  My daughter wore it with pride and it broke.  The cross is too small as well as it easily slips through the infinity symbol.  Discolored after a short time.  Poor quality. The cross was pictured with a gift bag while it came in a piece of cellophane.  Very disappointed."
"I originally loved this watch, however, after just 3 months, it is very unreliable.  Sometimes it seems to stop working for no reason at all.  When I tap it, it starts again.  Or it randomly stops and starts on its own, so when I think it is 3 pm, it is actually 3:15 and I am late to run to the bus stop.  I was not expecting much for $15, but I did want it to tell the time.  It is also got pretty dirty after a couple of months.  Again, for $15, I was not too upset.  I just need it to tell me the correct time.  I still wear it (it is a workout watch so I don't break my good one, but I seem to never take it off), but I constantly check the time on my phone.  One of these days I will get a new one...am sad that I could not rely on this one."
Didnt notice that the collar has too much design on it. Overall i looks like a shirt with many colors which My husband WILL NOT wear.
"If you truly have skinny calves, these are still too big. And they are too loose in the ankle too. They fit in the footbed normally. They left a gap and looked a little like galoshes on me, suprising so many people say they are tight, I am not a thin person and my legs are not that skinny. I mean yes they are narrow, but not super skinny. Even over jeans, I could stuff a sweater in the gap. Maybe they messed up with the boots I got. But these are big for skinny legs."
The straps give my son bad blisters on the arch of his foot
"I purchased 3 pair of Reef flip flops, the other two pair being the Women's Zen Wonder Sandal. I was not as happy with the Mallory Sandal's fit and traction as compared to the Zen Sandal. They are not as comfortable, in that they arch support is not there. They slip and slide on my wood floors. I'm not very happy with these sandals."
The straps were flimsy and kept sliding off my shoulders.
socks were not cotton.  they were a  blend that was obviously very much polyester.  Gross.
"More like plastic, don't look like leather to me,plastic shoelaces can't make tight or able to keep tied,traction not good,I used a few times and seem to be more hassle then they're worth,put in my coat closet and will donate to good will this year for a tax write off. I think Columbia is getting cheap these days."
"The 0-3 month size is not appropriate for a newborn. My baby is 3 weeks, 8.7lbs 21 inches and she is swimming in this item. We definitely didn't think she would be secure in her car seat in it. Nice red color though and it looks warm."
"Ran small , not wide for a wide."
Fell apart in one use. But the dealer does have other nice products.
"The product I received looked nothing like the picture I was severely ripped off. My t-shirt is faded and doesn't even look like a small. It looks like someone just ironed on a picture of Pusheen. I work too hard to be ripped off like this; that's 15 dollars down the drain, and I want my money back!"
dont like it
Terribly made.  First watch I tried band tore like paper
Not soft. After one wash they are really wide. Just ok.
Earrings are really small. Cannot hardly see them.  If I would of known how small they were I would not of purchased them.
This shoe costs too much and is too beautiful to fit so bad. The strap that goes across the toe is so tight. I was not willing to wait for it to stretch  out because of the price.
"The crystal and black beads are kind of glued on, or siliconed on, and I feel that it will just come off so I am returning it!"
"I was really excited to get these sandals and when they came in was extremely disappointed. They really are just flip flops. Wore them around the house and they seemed difficult to wear. I thought the quality was going to be a few notches above a regular flip flop but no, they're really just $40 flip flops. I know portions of the money go to a good cause but I had to return them.......and shipping was NOT free. Really thought I was going to LOVE these so didn't even pay attention to the return policy."
I actually give  ZERO stars!  Very dissapointed . Ordered a 42dd and it's like a 36! Complete waste of time waiting on the item to arrive !
"As with many larger cup bras, this one was merely big cups on the same frame, essentially wrapping the breast around the sides of the body.  I returned this."
Needs to be a little bigger other then that it looks real cute and had ok fabric for how long it's on
"Makes me trip sometimes.  By sometimes, I mean I frequently trip in these sneakers while I'm at work.  I am a personal trainer so I'd notice if I were tripping in the same places in other shoes.  The funny thing is that I'm not tripping at all in other shoes.

Love the color and they fit nicely."
"Cute and different.  NOT functional for a busy adult like me, who has more than stuff to put in, including cash.  NOTE, this wallet is opens on the vertical/portrait side, so the width of the money slot is EXACTLY the same length of a dollar bill minus 1mm.  The wallet also has a curved (folded) design, so you can't flatten it to fit more money.
It can fit 3-4 credit cards plus ID.  It can hold under 3 sheets of bills of US$ money.  That's it.
I usually have more than ten bills of money, and it will not fit in the billfold....  the wallet can't fold and close at that point.

I am a fan of small slim wallets because I carry a small bag and I travel lots.  I use the wallet from that skinny company :-)
I thought of switching to this one for the holidays, since my wallet is old.  Not working out.  Switching back and ordering a New one from the skinny company, whose small slim wallet can actually fit up to 20 bills and 8 credit cards -- amazing!"
The locket itself is nice the chain however has become dark crappy looking now I have to buy another chain for the locket I shouldn't have to!
This belt snapped at ratchet. It is unrepairable. Buy at own risk! Had it long enough to not be able to return.
"My wife found Clarks flat crocs shoes in a store that felt great and was the correct size. Unfortunately, the Clarks Women's Gael Angora Flat,Grey crocs. purchased from Amazon Planet Shoes were too big even though BOTH pairs of shoes have the exact SAME SIZE marked inside the shoe. Both pairs of shoes made in China. Is that the problem ? Made in China ?"
"It was returned immediately because it required shoe inserts to make it orthopedic.

Search ORTHOFIT.........the best."
"This is very small and a deformed design of a penguin. Eyes are off, although it works on a smaller charm bracelet the size does not fit well for anything other than that. My daughter loves penguins so she just considers this the ugly duckling/runt of litter."
"This shrug is pretty but I cannot tell the top from the bottom, I must flip it around many times before I get it on right."
Nice and just what I wanted but the post back did not fit tight enough and it fell off the first time I wore then so I lost them first time wearing them
I've only worn the grey pair and they are cute but they fell down all day. My other K Bell socks stay up until I take them off.
The bottom portion of the shank of this ring is very thin and I bent it just trying the ring on.  The top of the ring is beautiful and sturdy enough but since it it 925 Sterling Silver they should have made the shank portion thicker.  I'm very sad and do not recommend this item.
"The dress had loose strings and threads all over. I had to do a lot of cleaning up to make it look better. The dress is more a soft pink than nude. It fits tight, gathers wrinkles in a lot of areas. I have a slender figure and I had a few. It is transparent! You can see outlines of underwear and it's color. You will need a nude bra for sure! Just the gamble of purchased items online."
"Toe box cut into my feet because you did not offer it in wide. I tried using
 stretchers, and ended up giving the shoes to my mother-in-law."
"Thin material, smaller than expected but cannot receive a full refund for company  has $7.50 restocking fee on a $15.00 shirt."
"I bought this pendant for my daughter.  Like others have said, The writing on it is so small that you can not read what it says"
"Did not really help my night time driving vision.  I have some astigmatism and was hoping they would reduce glare and star burst effect more than it did.
Maybe 10% improvement"
"I bought the 3X for a friend but they were too small for her or me - My usual size is 2X (22).  They feel great, I like the gathered hem and shirring on the leg. The elastic draw cord was fun. I did not like the pocket placement at all.  I returned them.  But Calvin Klein is still one of my top labels for excellent fabric, style, and fit.  Read the other reviews."
I ordered 3 of your shirts and this review could be for any of them. I washed them before wearing and after the first was they and specifically this one looked old. It has not been worn in public and probably will not as it is now looking like a black tie die. It faded so badly that it looks gray in most places.
"Bought it in feb, and it already is missing two stones :("
"the jean is big for a size 12,its a big jean,the legs are wide too which i don't like,just wear it around the house"
"This product is obviously not the best quality... it's not very soft and the colors faded noticeably after one wash. But it's inexpensive, so I guess you get what you pay for. It's cute enough."
queda grande!!
"I ordered the boy striped socks in 0-6 months, and received 6-18 month socks. I haven't had my baby yet, but these socks clearly won't fit for a very long time. They look as big as (or bigger than) the socks my 17 month old daughter wears! Already tossed the plastic they came in, so I can't return them. Really disappointed."
not beefy at all. shrunk first time washed. My man boobs show great in this shirt.
Too small. I need to change to M size.
"Too small, not a good fit, a little disappointed"
"The kid loves the shoes, but they were not in the original Vans packaging which makes it difficult for me to gift this to him. If it is new it should have original packaging."
"I really, really wanted to like this hoodie.  The zipper is excellent, the style okay (it kind of hugs the hips), the sewing and workmanship really good - but the cashmere is not as soft as I want so I returned it.  I could feel a definite difference between my nice cashmere pieces and this.  This is not luxurious.  It feels like mildly scratchy merino wool.  I tried the pink, white and purple and all were the same.  If I'm going to buy cahsmere, I'd rather spend twice as much and feels surrounded by soft warmness.  I am 5'4"", weigh 106 lbs 34A bra size.  I wear small or xsmall everything but the Medium was the right size for me.  I returned them sadly!"
"While I have a small head compared to my friends, this wig was still too small even for me. I gave it to a kid down the street to wear for Halloween."
Disappointed in the length of the boot.  And I wear a size 7 but like to wear socks with my shoes so I usually get 7 1/2.  This boot came right to my toe without a sock.
Cheap cheap cheap
"Fit awkwardly and too large, Stiff material. Not the Hane's sweatshirt I once bought at target."
nice to look at and excited for the straps BUT the size .... perhaps EU has not increased sizes without telling consumers as in the US but US buyer beware these do not fit like US brands
No room for large breasts
This bra was too small for me. I wear 34B and I ordered 34C. The cups are way too small pushing my breasts sideways and out. I also felt that the cups are  quite shapeless. Another problem: thin straps give very little support.
Fell apart constantly. Not worth.
The crown separated one day and left me with a dead watch.
"I ordered 2 of these sleeveless tops.  Both colors were as described.  However the fit was poor on me.  I am not flat-chested and thin.  The yoke and bust area did not lie flat nor hang well.  This style and cut are best suited for slender bodies with small bust.  Would not recommend for larger body measurements.  The fabric is filmy thin and light - fine if that's what you are expecting.  Would certainly require another layer underneath.
(BTW-  I am size 12 with 42 bust, height - 5'6"")  Regretfully, no free return available, so I passed them on to a teenager who is tall and slender - don't think she likes them either.)"
"Not what I expected.  I thought there would be individual sleeves for each card but apparently, you put all 12 cards in the middle compartment together and the pull tab is supposed to pull them up.  The picture makes it look like they come up individually but mine didn't.  They didn't even come up very high.  There are no instructions so I don't even know if I'm using it right but that's what it looks like to me.  I wouldn't want to have to pull out a bunch of cards for everyone to see.  I'm returning the wallet."
"very cute,  however not even close to USA sizing. I am typically a size 8, however this is more like a 2 and I bought a LARGE, to be safe!  Now they are in the trash since there were not directions enclosed on how to return them!"
I purchased this in a 2x. These run super small. The width of my hand wouldn't even make it through the opening.
Returned item because it was cheap looking and the finish was starting to come off.
"ok yes, it's nice to have all these colors.  but honestly the flowers are not very cute.  i can see now why these are so much less expensive than other individual ones.  the headbands are ok, but the flowers are kinda cheap looking.  the metal clip part is actually REALLY sharp, and i can see it scratching baby's head real bad.  one thing i didn't notice until i put the flower headband on:  because the petals are so tight together and the way that they overlap, it just looks like a big circle on a headband.  when my baby wears it, she reminds me of a coal-miner, or those old-school doctors who wore the lamp on their head.  thats what it looks like, a big circle with a bright thing in the middle.

so no, i wouldn't really use these things.  the colors are too bright and cheapy looking.  or maybe i'm just a snob."
Terrible support
"Not worth the money to send back.  They're fine for wear on weekends over leggins or skinny jeans or under jean skirt.  I have them in the garage airing out as they have a noxious smell.  May have to febreeze them.  The heel heighth is fine.  The material is a dull color and you definitely can tell it's not real leather.  No zipper, so make sure your ankles and thighs aren't over muscular or you'll have difficulty getting them on.  There is a bit of stretch--hopefully not so much that they'll be scrunched down my legs."
"SUPER large. I was expecting it to be a little big, my son is in between the 16 - 18 size right now but this hung off of him like a man's XL, not a youth XL"
I was really disappointed with this dress and wish I had had the ability to try this on in a store. The top part of the dress rolls down and it is far too short (I'm 5'2'' and never have this issue.) I wore it a few times and had to fight to keep the top from rolling down. Not worth it and ended up just giving this dress away.
The overall construction (sewing) is okay.  It is very thin and does not come all the way around.  Sit just off the shoulders and needs a lot of decorating.. Velcro closure is very poor and will not stay fastened.
It doesn't really look like the one on the picture. :/
It's more like a shrug
Arrived on time.  To big.  Had to return.
Cute shirt but the length was too short. Wide shoulders with bellybutton length. The shortness makes the pulling over the head difficult.
These shows are abnormally small. They felt tight and because of the fabric it was slicing my feet. The foot pad is so hard it hurts your foot. I rather walk on asphalt.
"The shoe I  received is like the beaumont's poor unstylish cousin. It says it's a soft walk but I'm wondering. Not wide width, no embellishments no cutouts"
"Narrow, small, and DEFINITELY did not help my plantar fasciitis as was written in some reviews. Waste of money, and they hurt!"
Nope nope! Just keep on looking. These dresses don't even have tags on them that show the size. So you have no clue what you're getting. I ordered a 3-4 for my toddler and they sent a dress that would fit a 12 month old baby. It's cheaply made as well. Just not worth the hassle!
It is actually a pretty bag but the picture and description are not adequate. It is large. Colors are grey on one side and white on the other. Handles are black. That is a lot of color for one handbag. I also think it would be improved with a different closure.
"Seller is a liar!! It states that the ring size is 8.41, which is clearly a huge lie, its a size 5 & 3/4 which does not fit me at all!! The ring is beautiful though. I even paid extra for shipping to get it home faster since I had finally found my size. This must be corrected fast! Ugh!!! I an really upset! Gave it one star because its pretty, that's it."
"I loved these when they came, but they didn't last. Less than 20 wears and they look like the pictures. Bought 2 pairs for my boys- they lasted less time than the $5 Walmart ones my girls got."
Apparently a made in China Large does not = American large.
Way too large. Not tight at all
Didn't keep
I wore these shoes around my house and they felt fine. The following three days I wore them on my morning walk (a two and half mile hike in a nearby State park). On the third day the left shoe caused a blister on the back of my foot above the heel...closer to the ankle.  WOW what a disappointment!  I really wanted these shoes to work.
Prompt delivery. Initially liked it. No longer wear it as the clasps turned my wrist green.
No label or tag on the bra at all. Not even the size printed on it. I have worn the same size for 10+ years (which is what I ordered) and I could not even hook this bra. I can only assume the sizing is way off on this bra. I am  not even sure it was the brand it was listed as online. I returned it the same day. Highly disappointing.
"While these sandals are attractive, they are just too wide. I always wear a narrow shoe, and these are NOT narrow.  My foot slipped out. The length seemed TTS. If you have a wider foot, these may be a good fit for you."
I Returned this product cuz its so fluffy and not firm material.. material is like a pillow sheet..doesnt look like in image as firm.. its filled with stuff.. its good if u have bag filled with stuff...
Was expecting correct sizing.....but M is way TOO tight. Needed a L....though I am normally a M.....
"The bracelet was broken when I took it out of the package, but I was able to fix it for now"
Order 1 size up.  I'm usually a 5 but these were super tight.  The quality is cheap but then again they are cheap pants.
"My son only wore these for a grand total of 14hrs and the back pocket has worn through & is now a big hole
Won't buy these online again! Paid extra to have the Carhartt name - wasn't worth it"
this bathingsuit is horrible its not the color and the material is super cheap i wouldnt suggest it at all. paying to ship it back would cost to much so i just tossed it in the trash don't waste your money on it.. sorry but hey its the truth
"because its not as big as my last one purchased, wash one time shirt turns into 5x which is too small."
i like them but oder a medium my regular size and were to small
"they were broken when arrived.  I figured you get what you paid for.  It was not bad since the three things prior, were amazing.  Super huge nothing like the picture and very cheap looking."
The fit of the shoe was fine. The item arrived in a timely manner. The item itself...CHEAP!!! Not worth the effort. They went straight back.
does not fit with gelpads
These pants are comfortable and true to size but they're see through!!
"Too Small, cant put t-shirts in it."
"Way too big!  It's really cute, but I shouldn't have paid so much attention to the reviews saying it runs small.  My heavy over coat is a 14 and it's snug.  So I thought order up.  I actually should have ordered down!  I gave it to my niece.  She likes it anyway."
"Made for skinny/thin feet. I don't wear wide width shoes and these were really tight across the whole foot making my toes numb. Still hoping to break them in hoping they'll stretch, but can't wear them all day. Disappointing for crocs. Was expecting comfort from the get go."
"Nice but they broke quickly, I was expecting a better quality for the price."
"When I read that an item is wireless, I assume that means NO wires...anywhere.  The information failed to mention the side wire that gouges into the under arm area.  I only had the bra on for a few minutes but the discomfort from the side wire was with me for a while.

I love the color, but what it really boils down to is comfort.  This bra does not pass that test."
"Much larger than shown in photo. The color is more peach/yellowish and they came bent. Both were bent in different ways. Wouldn't order again.
Cute box that's about it. No clue why they are bent Bc they were in a box."
Material to thin :(
They are very cheap looking.
"It is absurd how small this shirt is compared to what it was supposed to be.

An XL was to be a size 16/18 and it is closer to a size 4."
Was ridiculously small .....
Should've read the reviews first! The size 8 fits more like a 7. Very uncomfortable.
"Ive bought two pair from Amazon.  This pair, the legs are twisted.  Especially the right. It becomes more pronounced when I sit,,the outside seem is so twisted, it runs across my knee cap.  The other pair has dye imperfections, I can deal with that."
"I normally have lots of room in an XL but this was way too tight to wear out in public.  If you are an XL, you do not have a small waist."
I should have trusted the reviews I read. Literally 1/3 of my behind was hanging out of the back. It's so disappointing cause these are the only pair they offer for women!
"To small, gave to my nephew."
Horribly cheap looking. It looks like a part of a halloween costume. Not worth my $25.00. Would have gotten a better pair at Ross for same price. What a crap!
didn't like texture
"Product came with a defect. One of the straps is inverted. Other than that, the panties part does not look same as pictured from the rear view. Overall for the price it's not too bad."
"I bought it in XL, but it fits like medium. The pants are fine, but the top is very small around the chest (and I'm a 38C)."
to big in the front
Oh my goodness this bag stinks of chemicals. I cannot even use it. So poor.
"too big, too dangly, too slouchy,  returned."
"This is my second pairs of Reef sandals. First, the sandals shown on Amazon's website had a brown sole but this one I had is gray.  The moment I put my foot in, the edges of the strap are so rough that it keeps chaffing against my foot. When I walk like my first pair of Reef sandals, the foot will be inwards towards each other. There is defintely something wrong with the strap design.
I am staying from Reef sandals. Give me a pair of Olukai anytime and it will last and extremely comfortable."
"I've had some bad luck with these underwear, They are ripping apart at the seams, leaving holes on the sides."
Watches keep coming apar! Now my wife said she finally lost a part!
"The dress is a great color and fits perfectly, but it isn't made very well and the decorative threads on the bodice came out. I had the item replace with no hassle and the second did the same thing in almost the exact same place."
"I have brought this type of bra before, but I really think the wrong label was on it, it was about 2 sizes smaller than the previous one I ordered from Amazon and the cup size was about .the same"
"I normally wear a S to M (95% S), but I got an M due to others' suggestion and bought an M. It fits great. Ample (but fitting) room around arms (to allow for a layer of thin clothing to fit under). Sizing wise, it fits perfectly. But because it is not soft enough for me, I returned it. I owned many cashmeres and this one does not live up to my standard."
It's super cute but is poor quality. Luckily I have family that sews and can fix the issues it came with. One pocket barely fits 3 fingers and the other just fits half of my hand. The hood is attached by 4 buttons and falls off constantly and the sleeves are different lengths.
The design looks 10x worse than the picture makes it seem
Huge fake cheap looking never again
"Beautiful and cozy boots, but they run small. My standard size in these boots had my toes hitting the front of the boot so I had to return them."
"Lighting of numerals seemed kind of dim, changed battery and the results were the same, band kind of thin and felt cheap and not hefty like other watches I own, consider price and you get what you pay for. I think there are a lot better watches out there for around the same price range.

T"
Did not like it - returned because the material was not what I expected it to be.  It sort of hung around my body.
Returned. Too wide in heel.
"The socks came with an unexpected free washcloth which is actually quite nice. The socks are not traditionally fuzzy socks. The socks stay up normal socks, and while not uncomfortable they are not the ultimate in softness that I was expecting from a fuzzy socks. These socks are not really fuzy at all, they are more of an elastic sock done in a bump pattern. The wash cloth can be imprinted with a company logo and I felt the washcloth was actually more sucessful than the socks."
Not what I expected ..not satisfied ..
Looked great!  Highly uncomfortable
"not the same color, too small"
Not a huge fan of this purchase. Probably shouldn't have bought such a large size. The fakeness of the CZ is noticeable.
"I am 5'9"""" and consider myself neither too curvy or too straight. I sent these back because of fit."
"What you would expect for the price: thin material, not at all flattering on a curvy body type."
"Gold toe doe this amazingly annoying, intentional {I think} thing, where the socks are NEVER the same when you order them twice.  Even the same ""line"" {uptown crew}, they vary the color, height, rib size, and hem size.  In this era there's no way that's organic.  I think they do it to keep you from being able to match new and old socks.

At least that's my conspiracy theory.

Anyway, I've been putting up with this since I was small because I wasn't sure it was going on before, or whether I was buying slightly different lines {models?} without meaning to.  Now I'm sure, and I'm pretty cross about it."
I've recently lost about of weight and the relaxed style don't work
Ordered a large for my 36 waist husband and they are way too small. Im a 28 waist and the large fits me. They are also too short. More like capris than pants.
the cap is cheaply made
"Looks Fake! Not really shinny, the little CZs fall out and its chinezy looking."
"This is a nice set. Soft and very cute, however the fit is ridiculous. Thankfully I read the reviews and ordered a 4T for my TWO YR OLD. He is a tad on the bigger side, but a 4T?! After shrinking in the wash some, it fits good. Come on Gerber, make your sizes a little more like everyone else's."
Awkward on the sides. I feel like my breasts are not supported on the sides and I constantly have to adjust.
Itchy material!
"After my daughter gently wore this shoe 3 times, the petal feel off one shoe.  Rip off!
Very disappointed!"
This material is weird. Didn't care for it and the top is really short. It barely came down to my belly button. Idk if it was just a weird cut or intentionally made like that. The picture doesn't look short but my order was. Other than that the shirt was cute. I still returned it
"I have no idea how this got such great reviews.
I was incredibly excited to try this on because so many people loved it and it seemed to look good on so many different shapes of people.

Well, it was a disaster on me. Because of the open back, the straps would not stay on my shoulders at all. In addition, the wings on the top did not cover my nipples (and I have very small areolas), and only the area between my nipples was actually covered (the rest of my chest was entirely exposed. I wear a 34C)
If you want any coverage at all on your butt, this is not for you. There is none. The very little material that is back there, will ride up your crack after 2 steps.

Very disappointed in this piece and will be returning for a refund. :(

UPDATE: seller contacted me after I posted my review to offer a refund of my purchase (This is good. I like sellers who try to make things right. However, I had already returned the piece to amazon.) However, in the same email, they asked me to remove my negative review. (This is bad. If a seller is asking people to remove or change bad reviews, then future shoppers are not getting an honest range of opinions from past purchasers. Keep this in mind while shopping.)"
For me this seemed like vinyl and for 279.00$ I expect more then vinyl. In my opinion I could have went to T.J. Maxx or Ross dress for less and found something of this vinyl quality with out the name Kate Spade and paid no more then $20.00 for this bag. I will avoid the name Kate Spade when ordering on the internet I will have to see and feel quality in person when it come to that name.
Fell apart after 1 wash.
"I was more than excited to receive these in the mail. However, I'm extremely disappointed at how dirty they were when I first opened the package. I bought the cream colored sandals which makes the marking on the right sandal obvious. These are supposed to be new sandals, so why am I getting ""used"" quality shoes."
"The bust and sleeves fit as expected. But this isn't a waist-hugging long tunic like it appears to be. It might as well be a maternity shirt. I have other shirts that fit more like this one looks like it should, but unlike the picture, this is super unflattering in real life."
"It says 3inches but was obviously 5 inches, had to return them. I couldn't even walk as far as the mirror ."
"Hoodie is extremely short in sleeves and torso length.  As well, an XL is no longer than a L, but about 2x the boxiness.  This is not a fitted hoodie at all and overall, it's just too boxy and too short.  Returned."
"When the stem was pulled out or pushed in , the minute hand moved 2 to 3 minutes. This makes setting the time impossible."
THIS skirt is a CURTAIN. lol I am 5'2 and this is not a mid-ANYTHING. it is mid-FLOOR. lol I will have to cut the skirt almost in half to get a midi skirt!
"I have a very wide foot and it is difficult to find shoes that fit comfortably. These were too narrow even in the widest size.  Also, in person, they looked more like men's shoes than women's and make your foot look really long."
"bad quality, uncomfortable  too narrow."
They must review the sizes
"I read the reviews before purchasing this item and saw that many people wrote the exact same thing as i am writing now.  Decided to still purchase b/c, afterall, how different can it be, and I've used Nimbus forever with great results.  Well, A LOT different.  The shoe is too narrow, and feels flimsy.  Huge fail on quality from Nimbus 12.  I returned them."
"Cute. But ultimately trash. Bottoms worn and they loosened up, velcro doesn't stick as well....after two weeks of mild outdoor walking. Expected more from Teva"
"I'm going to be blunt. The garment is very cheaply made, visible seams, and thin doesn't even begin to describe this garment. Also the red is more of an orange-red in color. I would be afraid to wash it for fear of it falling apart in the wash.
I returned this item."
"Cute skirt but it arrived with a ripped seam in the back, luckily I caught it before I wore it. It will be cute after I repair it with a few stitches."
somewhat small like 1/2 size per size chart.
"Uncomfortable, no cushioning for running"
The fit was ok but no smoothing compression  fit like reg. Panties had some from shopping  network  before  and there's was awesome.
"The fabric clings enough to highlight any cellulite in colors other than black. No thank you. Fit is nice though and very comfortable. So, I'd imagine it'd be great in black or for someone without much cellulite. Can't speak to durability because I returned immediately."
"I do not like these socks - synthetic fabric, bad for toddlers"
"I received two watches, One which was suppose to be a christmas gift, but watch doesn't work. The other also not ticking, wore one time and the bracelet broke just like that. Poor quality, for such a nice looking watch. :-("
"Cheap, ugly, flimsy material. I didn't want to pay to send it back to China so it went to the trash."
"Cute shoe, but way too small.  Will be returning."
"The quality of this is terrible. I got it broken, the company was very nice about it, but it kept falling apart. I would not recommend."
"I have a pair of sperry cup collection I purchased 5 years ago in a 9m and they fit great. Purchased same size in these and they were very very tight. I have a wider foot but I didn't think that wide so maybe I'll just stick with gold cup since the leather tends to be of better quality. Other then that the shoe looks great just as described.
Also a few weeks ago stopped into the mall and tried on same shoe and size but in wide and still very tight.  Then I came across sperry gold cup. Size 9 medium fits like a dream and the leather is fantastic. Spend the extra money, you'll be glad you did"
I know the price was really cheap but not really worth the buy.
"Very cute. Wide and too small. I wear a 9 regular width and had to return. Would try them in a 10, but concerned theyll be way too wide."
"It actually looks nothing like the picture, the material is quite flimsy and it runs pretty small. Very dissapointed"
"I bought these discounted but they came in in PERFECT condition.  I was surprised as to how light weight they were for being as bulky as they are.  They are larger overall than most of my shoes but for a pair of cheap work shoes they were perfect.  The shoe itself is large not the size.  I've had them for a few months now and the only issue is that something inside of them in the toe area has come apart.  It's like a seam of leftover material that hangs over and gets under my toes.  I have definately given them a run for the money so I can't complain.  I'm hard on shoes, especially work shoes.

Edit: 3/12/14 here I sit with a huge hole in the toe area of my shoe.  That seam of left over material I mentioned in my original review was actually the glue & seam coming apart!  The whole front area of my shoe is detatched from the base.  I know I put a lot of wear on my shoes for work but I've never had a pair of shoes do this to me and I've worn some for way too long.  It was worth the $20 I paid and that's the value of them!  They're just junk and if Reebok can't make these right I'm not about to spend more money than that on them."
I tried this as an alternative to underwire...  didn't work for me.  Returned
"Too large, looks like xlarge, returned for refund. Still waiting for refund."
"Way to heavy for the kids ears
 But very pretty"
This was NOT the scarf I ordered. I didn't even recognize what the item was that I received... very thin green scarf (solid color) not even infinity... I don't get it.
Very large & see thru. Returning them.
Unflattering unless you're stick thin
"The bra is big.  I was told at Macy's get a size or two up for comfort.  So I have been doing that with the Wacoal bras and they have been terrific.  When I saw the sale price on this bra, I thought what the heck, I'll go for it.
The back was big, the cups were big, and sounds funny ~ the push the breast out to the side, ~ that is how it minimizes ~ not a good look :(.
I was going to return it but thought I'd try washing it and maybe it would shrink, no.  The fabric is good :)"
couldn't wear it. says its baggy one size fits all but I'm a size 10 and I had to throw them out because they were way too tight on my legs. the stitching was also weak.
"Returned it.  WAAAAY Too small.  Length was excellent, but did not at all fit around the gut area. Disappointed."
lovely but did not fit too small
Kinda thin and cheap
So cute but they give me a headache every time I wear them - caused by something visually. Visually everything is clear.
"The front part is too narrow, long n tight. I hv to remove the insole to fit my size. However it is pretty uncomfortable when I walk for about 10 mins. Though I hv ordered a size up my feet hurt every time I try to walk."
"I have a air of gel kayano 19 number 12,5 and they are a litlle to tight so I ask for these 13, final result, too big, I don't get it."
"Don't waste your money on this, it was broken upon arrival."
"It has taken me 3 try's but I have now discovered the Stacy Adams fit that's right for my feet. I now own 7 pair of the Madison cap toe oxfords in as many different colors and plan to purchase more of the same model..  The Madison cap toe oxfords are well constructed with good materials and a great buy for the money. Lesser expensive Stacey Adams models do not meet my standards for shoes I purchase but I really do like this model, more than a lot obviously, 7 pair attested."
"Poor material, XL fits like medium."
"It was small and the zipper ripped within a week, it was for my daughter she is 7 so I
Was expecting a good quality"
"These shirts are super thin - even the dark colors are very see-through. They also run very small. I am usually a XXL at Old Navy, ordered a 3X in these shirts and they are very, very skin tight. Beware"
"These pants may be ""Never Iron"" but they are ""not wrinkle free"".  So if you want wrinkle free, you will need to iron pretty heavily.  I previously had premium wrinkle free Dockers.  You could take them right out of the dryer, hang them up and they were good to go.  Not these.  Once ironed they are good everyday work pants.  But you will have to iron them to look respectable."
"While this is a pretty bracelet, I had thought from the photo and description that the chains were much thicker and sturdier. I feel it would break very easily. The whole bracelet is smaller than I thought ( not the length)  in appearance- the chain width and the size of the infinity symbol. Am returning it. Excellent prompt service and packing though!"
"Fit was a little weird on me, I don't fill it out all the way. I wanted something a little lower cut. Ended up donating to thrift store."
"These shoes are really narrow (I have an average foot width) and make my feet looks SUPER long. Also, they would be fine if worn in 30 minute increments, but more than that and my feet started hurting. Would totally NOT recommend these."
"I figured people were exaggerating and I should trust Amazon sizing on this somewhat. Wrong. Their xx large is not a x large, as they claim. It is actually a US medium. I would have liked this shirt some years ago when it would have fit."
I purchased these based on the price and reviews.  I expected a better quality - very disappointed.  They were cheaply made and looked like shoes you would purchase for $40 at one of those discount big box shoe stores.  Sent them back.
"I bought this on account of the good reviews thinking it would look real. It doesn't look even remotely authentic as far as the ""diamonds"" go. I could deal with that but i can not get any jewelry shop to take links off for me because this watch does not have the engraved arrows of which side to remove the links. For that reason DO NOT buy unless you have massive wrists!"
"First off, it's thicker and stiffer than all my other NATO straps. And it just feel coarser. Second, the design is idiotic. There is a stitch about an inch down from the second loop from the buckle that stitches the lower strap to the main strap (you can see it if you look closely in the images) that prevents you from putting the watch case where you would normally put it on a NATO strap, forcing you to put it in a very small area, and putting immense stress on the springbars due to the tightness of that small area and the aforementioned stiff material. I had to go in with a pocket knife and take off the stitch, allowing me to separate the two straps. Speaking of, the lower part of the strap is very long compared to normal NATO strap proportions (probably to make room for that stitch). This makes the far loop sit much farther down from the other two loops. Just feels off. Doesn't wear as tidily as most NATO straps. In addition, the thick material and coarse construction means the fold-over and stitching on the far loop is so thick that it digs into the medial part of the wrist. Lastly, the buckle is farther from the two loops than most NATO straps, so the entire positioning feels very off.

I do give it two stars though because it does look good, even if it doesn't feel good."
"These look and feel pretty cheap, but worst of all...they stink!!  They have a weird chemical smell, and it stays with you for a while after removing the gloves.  I bought a few pairs of these for Christmas gifts, but they're too stinky, so I kept them.  I should have just sent them back.  They do work on devices, but at what cost?  I'm afraid of what chemical is seeping onto and into my skin!!"
These must be fake Wigwams (I hope). They are see through on the bottom after just a few wears. I expected better quality
"The flap over the owl was crooked, like I wouldn't notice. The lighter color fabric is too soft to protect any electronic device and its way too big to fit a cell phone securely. The owl is cute, I'll give him two stars but the case gets zero."
"I will be donating these to St. Vincent de Paul.  They should be described as riding low on the hips.  I personally describe them as ""bladder huggers"".  Further on into the workout, they become ""merciless bladder squeezers"".  They wouldn't be so bad (I do wear a shirt that covers my mid-section adequately) if the elastic wasn't straight across the bladder."
"These are tiny. Almost toy like. Do not waste your money, nothing but air will fit in these! I would not have marked any star if I could have generated this review without one."
Fit well but the traction on trails is horrendous. Ive never slipped that much in my tactical boots but boots designed for hiking slip on the smallest area of loose rock whereas my tactical boots dig in. Too expensive for lack of grip. Paying for a name
"Did not like the bracelet due to the fact that if you wind it 5 times, it would be too loose.  If you wind it 6-7 times, it would be too tight."
Broke within the first 2 days my son had it.
"Very pretty and exactly what I wanted...but.  Hopefully this was a one time thng, but the soles started peeling apart after two day light wear.  And the thong on my left foot loosened after initial wear and on close examination, the stitching on that shoe was not up to par.

Shoes.com was very gracious in refunding my money.  I would definitely shop with this company again for that reason though maybe not Nomad."
I wish I could give these shoes a zero star! They are hideous and cheap looking!  The bottoms are glued on and very thin. And the cheap material they are made out of is so thin and crappy.  If you get them wet you are screwed! Don't waste your money.
The size 9 did not fit at all. Yet the 9 in another brand fits just fine
This dress is very very short. Was not able to wear it.
Description says leather upper. It is not. It is plastic.
"I felt like this particular style of shoe was wider than most.  I love sketchers and i wanted to try their work shoes.  I usually wear a 91/2 or 10 in sneakers but when i ordered a 91/2 it was a little big.

Fyi i don't have wide feet or narrow"
"Update: I was barely able to get all of my things inside the small pockets. Disappointing.

I believe I will like this purse. I like the long cross body strap because I have problems with shoulder bags pulling my hair because it comes down onto my shoulders.
I want to make some comments based on another purchaser who posted multiple reviews about the bag. I have posted photos below that just show my experience compared to the comments made. I cannot put my one passport in the front pocket and zip it. I would not risk having someone simple slip my passport out and have it stolen. I have a friend that had her passport stolen and it was a very bad experience. The pocket that looks like it would be for a cell phone will not hold my IPhone 6s that she made a point of stating she also has several times. I keep my phone secured in a case and I would have to remove it and it would fit snugly in the pocket. I have a piece of paper in the photo that shows if you're a smoker you would probably keep your cigarettes in that pocket.
The top opening is smalller than I expected. Although the bag itself does appear to otherwise be roomy and all of the extra zip pockets are nice. I will probably cut out the inside slip pocket bacause they do not appear to be useful for anything.
Also the tied pulls on the zippers are not the same color because they are obviously cut and were not sealed off on the cut ends.
Overall it is a nice cross body bag for the price but I would not consider the color Khaki or looks more grey."
I didn't care for that extra flap of material over the chest.  I returned it.
The belt smelled like it was soaked in pesticide for a month. The smell was so bad that it would get onto anything it came into contact with and cause it to smell like the pestcide as well. This is dangerous stuff. I wore it today and touched it extensively with my hands and now my fingers are feeling a little strange... numb
My umbrella came bent. It is hard to open and even harder to close. It is also huge! Guess I've never had an adult sized umbrella before. I'm sure it will protect me from the rain but if I can't close it easily when I am out in public I won't use it.
"I bought 3 packs of these because of reviews stating their softness and comfort. Well, I must have got a bad batch, or something, because the ""cotton"" used to make these things would only be considered ""soft"" if it were burlap.... and trust me, I'm not very picky. The band at the bottom actually felt like it was burning my skin at times. I've washed them in various fabric softeners, and it only helped a bit. One positive is that they seem to be made well. That's why I gave 2 stars as opposed to 1."
"Ordered the navy in 3T.  Fit as expected but the color on top of the light blue decal is PINK! on my screen it appears orange.  If i had known, i would not have ordered it.  I think it could be sold a a UNISEX top, not boy's"
"I am editing my comment on this bag because the zipper, after less than a month stopped working.  It takes me like 15 to 20 minutes to zipper it, which sucks because I travel for work and you know, have to present my license at the airport.  Otherwise though, this bag is beautiful.  I have gotten so many comments on it.  I also like the compartments."
shoes are very uncomfortable
these are awful
"The only time I wore one of these it broke.

Update I tried another color and within 2 days two of the beads fell off. I would not recommend this product - I would have given it zero stars if I could."
Cheap and gaudy...
"this bag has a very bad smell to it.  also, the bottom is very narrow so I can't fit certain things in it, which is why I wanted a big bag to begin with.

will never use this seller again, as can't return w/o a restocking fee and the customer has to pay for return shipping."
"By biggest complaint which overrides everything about this jewelry cabinet is, once I put all my jewelry in it, it wouldnt close.  Its not deep enough to accommodate items hanging on door. Even after I took some away, especially the bulky ones, it still wouldnt close all the way. Theres about 1.5 - 2 inches gap.  Very, very disappointed!"
Love the shorts but they came apart at the seams in several places after only wearing a couple of times.
"Ended up giving these away, they are just too small, I bought two pairs of shoes the exact same size, these were noticeably smaller, kinda upset by this, but it's alright, they made for a decent gift to someone else."
"Way too short, these were total floods plus they run big! I sent them back."
Macrame product
"This is like a cheap paper hat. It came all squished up, wouldn't stay erect, and needed to be ironed to get all the wrinkles out. But we didn't iron it because it was so thin I was afraid it would catch on fire. We went it back."
Way too short.
"These shoes felt like cardboard, but i bought them to only wear with a few outfits. A few weeks later they started to turn black (red started to fade) and now, i have to walk a certain way bc it feels like cardboard folding"
I liked these thongs but they snapped really quickly !  honestly I only got like two wears out of them
The leather and sole's seems to be decent quality.  But keep in mind these are out of China. Everytime I wear them they give me nasty heel blisters regardless of the socks I wear.  So there's a build issue there becuase they're the correct size for me.  I was unable to return them too.
Too narrow.  I have seen a number of reviews that have had this complaint so it confuses me as to why Minnetonka doesn't make shoes for wider feet.
"I bought 7 y 1/2 (the correct size of shoes), but the size shoes are smaller."
"Dang it, so pretty....but oh so ouchy!  Using olive oil, I did manage to finally get on. Wowza, openings are really snug, even after I pried them open some.  They actually hurt. I have other types of that don't. Too lazy to return but won't wear again."
Hoping for a better fit. Gave it to Goodwill.
Doesn't tie tight enough to actually stay on your feet. You literally walk out of your shoes. I returned them
"I don't have large feet, in fact I wear this type of sandal a lot and have never had a problem - the band is so tight that I could barely get my left foot in."
Too tight can't stand being so tight.
"Even though I love New Balance the 600 series runs a half shoe size small.  I always wear a 9 extra wide (2E) but I ordered these as a size 9 but they were too small.  If you buy these shoes, which are good shoes, order a half size bigger."
You get what you pay for. It literally started falling apart the first time it was used.
"Do not buy this!!!  The material is so thin & cheap it ripped the first day! The bottoms were also really tight & one of the straps just came off. It didn't rip, it's like it wasn't even sown in all the way. Very poorly made overall.  The crotch was also made weird, very tight, I hate the whole thing & mad I wasted money on it."
Very nice shoe but it was somewhat narrow and small. My feet hurts all day if i wear it. i took it to Africa for my vacation and could not wear it more than a week.
"One leg longer than the other, they stretch out and never went back to normal and the design is all stretched out as well"
It is a nice outfit but better on someone else
They are listed as size 13 4E and the box is labeled the same but the shoe is not labeled and is probably a size D not and E.The order states WIDE. Don't buy this size because its hard to tell until you wear them a few times and wonder why your side toes are hurting. By the time you figure it out its to late to send them back for and exchange.
"My review is only based on the product the seller was fantastic and I will purchase again from this seller. The shoe was worn less than two days and the sole split! Not what I expected from new balance.. Very disappointed!! Needed a quality steel toe pair of shoes for work. We wound up at red wings shoe store.. They had to special order the size but had them for us in two days went in to pick up and they measure your foot and help you to get the most comfortable solution possible! Blown away by the service and the quality! We won't ever switch again the quality and the service alone are worth the money spent! Again, my review is product based the seller did everything they could have done the shoea just weren't the right fit for us!"
"no like at fotpho is go at pesonal is very diferen
\"
"They're not high waisted like the photo, unless you want your butt cheeks hanging out. They're really short. Too short in my opinion. Also, I'm a size 8 and I ordered a medium, but they were pretty tight, more like a 6."
"I'm 5'7"" and 150lbs. I ordered a Large and it felt too tight around my legs. I think it would have fit better if I were shorter. It's beautiful in person, just what I expected it to look like and seems like a quality suit. It just didn't fit"
"I really wanted to like these. They are cute, warm and fit well except they felt like ski boots in that they forced me to walk with a constant bend in my knees and did not allow me to straighten my legs. The boot is even angled a bit forward from the heel up. Perhaps this is an intentional design component that helps with something but I felt horribly uncomfortable and knew I would not be able to play in the snow in them or drive comfortably."
The sewing on this was weird the sleeves were overly huge and the fabric was odd.
Had to return this as it was very scratchy and uncomfortable and did not fit well. Sending it back.
"I wanted to love this because it is adorable. But it's a ""one size fist most"" I am a 34B; the straps don't adjust (maybe like a centimeter) and it's the kind you have to pull over your head. The actual circumference of the bra is too big and has little elasticity so it is just loose around the bodice and kinda baggy. SO SAD!"
Visible scratch on one of the diamonds.
very hard ti figure how to wear ans when I did weerr uncomfortable.
"I'm 5'1"" 120lbs so I'm not wicked tall but I'm also not extremely skinny. As soon as I opened the dress I knew it wasn't going to fit and I got a small. It seemed more like a large! So when/if buying these keep in mind that they run very big!"
It is a little too clingy and not very complementing I got a large and im 5'5 at about 165lbs
The clasp broke on the 3rd wearing.
"Pants fit as expected, but are very stiff.  I probably would not purchase again because of that.  Otherwise, they are waterproof and easily fit over other pants... just stiff as a board!"
"The indicated dimensions and comments to the dimensions do not coincide at all.
Fabric is rough for such a feminine style. Sits on a figure like a bag of potatoes."
"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!  the zipper is defective and I didn't find out till it was too late to return and can't reach the seller.  Our first day in Mexico and the zipper blew apart.  26.00 wasted, it is a shame because it is really cute but don't buy this one!"
"They begin to compact and fail to offer the original support.  Definitely NOT worth $45.

I hate shoes on my overly hot feet, but need arch support for my knees.  These began as perfect!
Heed the warnings about breaking your body in gradually; they do a nice job of realigning your bones, forcing you to use muscles differently.  Too much at once can be painful.  Sure, you think you can handle it! But throw another pair of shoes in your bag just in case that first week.  Too bad they don't last."
"ok, short, boobs too small!!"
I am astonished as to why would they sell this undesirable product here? I received it a week back and it was disappointing to see the strap already coming off and looks like a cheap material. I threw it back in the box and never wore it. Don't they check the status of the product before being delivered? This is a nightmare on this site! Wouldn't recommend to buy it.
"They're made for very small nipples. Girls with larger nipples, save your money!"
Shirt very small and not stretchable!!!
"Liked what I saw so I bought 10. What can I say I'm a guy. They arrived today. Two different styles, different patterns, different pockets. Some say ""LEGEND"" and some say ""EGEND"" and ""made in Pakistan. Pics below."
"Well - while we have loved two of the Men's Invicta Watches (The Invicta Men's 1461 Vintage Collection with Riveted Leather Strap Brown Dial Watch and the Invicta Men's 0352 II Brown Leather Watch), this Ladies Angel, Pink with Rhinstone bezel, was a huge disappointment. The band is a lightwieght plastic - and overall, just looks and feels very cheap. I like the white face and numbers, easy to read and water resistant to 30m. The face is about the size of a silver dollar.

But even the color of the pink isn't appealing. It's not quite salmon, but leans that way, and it's not a pretty shade of pink either. It simply looks like a discount store, toy watch. Just can't recommend it unless you have a younger teen who would like the look and lightweight feel of it, and then it may be too large to fit her wrist. And for the price, there are lots of other choices. Big disappointment."
cute but i ev en ordered 2 sizes up and they are way way too small
"Listed as ""size 9-11"". What the package says when you read it is sock size 9-11 - which apparently is different from shoe size 9-11. I wear a shoe size 10. These fit, but barely. They are tight in the calves. I have pretty unimpressive calves, despite my huge feet. These leave painful rib marks around my calves and all the way up my ankles. They are a weird sort of scratchy fabric. They may wick moisture but they don't seem to keep my feet more comfortable. Plenty of cushion, which is nice. They just aren't comfortable between the size and the odd itchy fabric."
1 pair ripped the first day I wore them. There is a giant hole in the heel. The other pair has held up but still disappointed
They are being returned. The back up f the be snapped in off. They were a gift. Am vvery embarrassed
"Ordered a size 8 for my daughter, got a 9.  I wear an 8-1/2 and these boots were big, really big, on me.  Normally I would think it was a simple mistake, but judging from other reviewers who received a size they didn't order, it's not a one-off.  As far as comfort and style goes, the style was like the pic but because of the size issue, I have no idea how comfortable they are."
They suck. They move around and look awkward and unnatural.
"Looks nice in the picture, but is not that comfortable to wear."
"Unfortunately, these stockings barely fit up my calf.
I am 5'10'' with a regular build.
I'm disappointed because they look the same as the picture but, don't fit whatsoever."
"The size I selected, based on the Size Chart provided and also on what I would normally wear, was too small.  I ended up having to give it to my cousin. I'm very disappointed!"
The white one is absolutely see through and there is no support. You must wear a bra - but it shows through. Maybe the other colors are better. I sent mine back immediately.
Too thin . I could see my toenail color through the sock
I bought another brand of double stick tape and it worked perfectly: stayed on tight and didn't budge. This stuff unstuck almost immediately! Didn't work at all. I'm throwing the rest out.
"Incredibly small for large chested women, even for a D cup.  It fit more like a C cup."
This watch is really bulky and heavy and was difficult to fasten.  Didn't care for the way it looked on my wrist and decided to simply return it.
"It is hard to make this kind of belt nonfunctional but the manufacturer has succeeded.  Second time I wore it, the part of the buckle that secured the cut end broke when I bent over.  It didn't come loose, it tore apart from the rest of the buckle and dropped in the floor.  Embarrassing as well as aggravating.  It was cheap and, as usual, you get what you pay for but this was ridiculous."
"I sent it back, It was a large and ran small,"
Advertised for 4 and up . Way to. Big fir my 5 yr old
"Quality& weight appears to be good, but there was a snag across the fabric & some marks in the fabric."
"product is cheaply made, don't recommend it"
"Ordered a size 14, the package weighed 29lbs. I'm 28 years old and 6'4"", my knees were hurting almost instantly from walking around with what felt like cinder blocks tied to my feet."
This dress was a very awkward fit.  The sleeves were super long the the rest of the dress was tight.  I'm 5'2 and usually wear a size 8/
Quality is good but i did not like these earrings at all they are for older women and they look wearing
Feels cheap. Could get better quality at Walmart.
"I was really interested in buying these until I saw the logo on the footbed... Best Friends Animal Society is a cover for a well-known satanic cult, the Process Church, who worship both Christ & the devil. Seriously, Google it. I saw a documentary on satanic cults & they were in it, & I also find it suspicious how connected this organization is to celebrities, & now a major company like Sketchers? Why are they all giving so much attention to a ""non-profit"" animal shelter out of Utah? Anyway, God only knows what they're really doing over there, but I can't knowingly give them my money, no matter how comfy the shoes."
"These sandals were purchased in my normal size, but they are almost 2 sizes larger than my regular sandals. I do not recommend this shoe."
Too much material
"don't buy it, horrible material, very cheap, don't wast your money"
Fit runs small. It's just an ok product. Nothing special about it. It's a little bit on the low end as far as quality.
Always weirdly tight on my head and one day just fell apart.
"Horrible quality and material. Do not purchase. Purchase Kirkland Costco socks. Now those are the bee's knees.  The material is so cheap, is does not grip your feet while wearing them.  Your feet will slip inside them and create blisters.  I have donated these socks to good will.  Your feet will hate you if you use these for hiking."
"These sponges do not make your shoes shine in one application, they leave behind a matte residue, which when polished *will* shine. However, if you want a quick shine these will not work as advertised. One star because they are not ""Instant"" and not ""moneysworth"""
Really inferior material its like walking on the floor. It enough foot support. If there was a zero this would be rated zero
This shoes look lovely but they have killed my feet and also they look too worn maybe the materials used is not too good because they have peeled off
"Doesn't last, don't buy"
waay too small
"I ordered white metallic and expected white. These are bone metallic. The shoe was cute and fit, I ordered 10W. Fit true to size. I just needed white for Easter. If you need a bone color these shoes would be great and the metallic made them a little stiff but was cool the way they shined!"
Arrived 2 days late. Looks and fits nothing like description. Definitely not a dress. Can be tunic. Go up a size.
"Runs very small, and straps aren't adjustable. Not the quality I expected from Warner's."
The material was very flimsy and see-through. I could have made something better and cheaper with some fabric and rope.
"Size was more like a 12 than an 8..far too large for my son (who usually wears 7, got a bit larger to allow for shrinkage)"
Super cute pattern but they ripped in the crotch the first night I wore them. Very cheaply made.
"The opening is very small, for those of us that have wide feet is almost impossible to fit. Once I was able to fit it, it squeezed my feet so hard it start to tingling. I only had it on for a few minutes.
It is very preety though."
"I really wanted to like this vest. But it just doesn't work for me. And I can't really put my finger on why, other than the problem is the way it fits. I like camo, so the design was quite attractive. It's a dark brown and doesn't have the same old run of the mill camo design. It has a quilted fleece lining and appears to be well made.

However, when I put it on, it just looks weird. It looks like it flares out under my arms, and has a boxy look to the body. I'm 6'1"", and the large size is barely long enough. Maybe with enough wear it would soften up some and not look so stiff. The fabric doesn't seem stiff, but it kind of bounces back to a very flat shape when I take it off. I'm trying to think of what I can compare it to. Its somewhat like that stiff foam sheet packing material, about 1/4"" thick that no matter how hard you try, doesn't wrinkle.

I should add that I bought this in a Lightning Deal for about $25. I don't think it's worth the regular price of over $60, even if it fit right."
These shoes looked kind fun but are very cheaply made. The seams started to fall apart. There are plastic parts sewn on that cracked and started to fall off. The shoes were loose in the wrong areas to be able to cinch up enough to properly fit without over-binding the rest of the shoe.
Too large.  Would not stay up if attached to stockings. Suspenders packaged loose.  No way to attach to shorts without cutting holes in seams.
not as beautiful as it seems in the picture
This is embarrassingly too large like a police handcuff. The links are too large for a bracelet. I can't wear it. Looks so trashy
These worked great using my phone but the pilled badly on the first use and they no longer looked good.
"I love this ring.the color of the sapphire,the small diamonds but the tiny diamonds keep falling out.don't waste ur money its not sturdy"
"I have worn military boots my whole life, Army and then Navy, this boot is definitely not made well, and the materials are sub par, and the construction will not last, its a total waste of your money, don't waste your time and money."
Crappy material. So bad.
These capris run a little small - more of a junior size.
"Attractive shoes, but: Narrow in the front (though it was C width), and yet so wide in the back that my heel slipped out at each step, even wearing socks."
"These boots are super cute but, they do not stay up at all.  One you start walking they fall down below your knees and look terribly sloppy.  I am really disappointed in these boots."
"It was not what was advertised, to thin, could only put in a few cards."
"Very difficult to get into. Very uncomfortable. I am a 34G, did not like the fit."
You get what you pay for. Purse broke a week after Christmas. It was a gift for my kid.
The polish is okay but the brush separated from the cap the second time I opened it.  Now the black cap twists off and I have to use an instrument or pliers to remove the brush from the polish.
"I threw it out, came thru looking like it had been cooked.  Couldn't polish shoes just blotches!"
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND DOESN'T FEEL GOOD QUALITY. FEELS LIKE SOME KIND OF FAKE KENNETH COLE PURSE
"Just receive those pans. Open and throw in the garbage can.
Because they are not ""COTTON BLEND""!!,
but 60% cotton and 40% polyester.
My father always say:
""Worst people on the world are Lairs, because they are making the biggest problems""."
"the fabric did not feel comfortable on the skin, I returned it"
My opnion on this swimsuit is its not the same color to me as the one pictured. This swimsuit was $40 and I think I will return it ..... I ordered a $20 swimsuit off of amazon and LOVE IT ! But this one was mediocre at best .
Loved these for the 3 months until the heel tore off and zipper broke.
"If you're cool with wearing shoes that don't match, then these might be for you. Me, I'm very dissatisfied!!!"
Ring came on time looks wonderful but my first day not even 12 hours into wearing the ring and already a stone is missing. I guess you get what you paid for. I will not be buying nothing from this seller again. If i could i would not rate this product at all.
Material not flexible. I had to return it.
"beautiful sweatshirt. I am keeping it, but is very small for size. I usually war XL in sweatshirts because I like the extra room. I ordered the XXL and it fits but not too much room for shrinkage. Very soft comfortable product otherwise. Love the way the colors blend together,"
"no t the best I have ever purchased, but worth the price I paid for them"
"go up one full size unless you like them tight, since I have already washed and dried them they will not be returned."
"Way smaller than expected/appeared.  I was disappointed with their size.  They can only fit small items, like socks or underwear.  I thought they were bigger, for example - to hold shoes."
Don't believe what they said about sizing. I'm a 38D. It barely covered me. I sent it back.
"Your clothing is to small, when we try sending it back it cost more than what it was bought for. You no longer have my business.  Send clothing  bigger the size which was chosen.. everybody is not small. I chose ex-large or xx-large...the coat fits a person maybe size 5.  Unbelievable."
"I have other biking shoes size 40 that fit me perfectly, this size 40 for some reason was too small.  Had to return them."
Not pleased looked odd on
"This wallet is practically made of paper with crooked stitching, and its so much bigger than any childs pockets."
"I'm so sad about these shoes. It's so discouraging to search and search for weeks for some ""wide width"" shoes that are cute and affordable. There is a big lack in options for those of us wide width needs. So I was pretty excited to come across these, to find Wide shoes that are cute and affordable and IN MY SIZE?? Amazing! Unfortunately in this case the term ""wide width"" is incredibly incorrect. These so-called WIDE shoes are so narrow I nearly couldn't get them on my feet! And I know what you're thinking - my feet aren't gigantically wide, they're just a LITTLE wide! So, sadly, they had to be returned, and I've learned my lesson, I'll not waste my time trying to order Lucky brand ""wide"" shoes again."
Zipper caused a wave in both sizes I purchased...very unfaltering which is sad bc it's a pretty dress
Nice time price sweet lookso  plenty complaints can't beat the price.
The reviews are right....arms very small and clingy to the skin.
"I ordered several styles of Robeez shoes for my 13 month old when she started walking.

These were so cute online. I was disappointed when I got them. Compared to the others styles we ordered in the same size, these were flat and floppy. And they looked that way even when we tried them on. These ran big both length-wise and width-wise, more so than any of the other styles. In person, these were the least cute even though they were one of the front runners when I was shopping for online.

Another thing I didn't realize or consider when I was ordering but found out after trying on a couple of styles is, suede is only good for the bottom soles. It gives the shoe grip and traction and keeps baby from slipping. A completely suede shoe like this one, will pick up any and all dirt, lint, moisture, oil from everywhere. You have to throw the shoes in the laundry and hope for the stains to come out. The pair I actually kept was leather on top and suede on the bottom. I can just wipe those clean with a wet nap.

I do recommend Robeez in general for babies just starting to walk. They are so soft and pliable...like ballet shoes. They don't constrict baby's feet either.  They give the feet just enough protection and traction/grip. Just try a different style. The ones I ended liking, fit and look wise are:

I liked the maryjane styles because they provide more ventilation for the feet. But Robeez also makes tons of adorable booties style shoes."
These were way too long and ripped the first time I wore them.
"not according with the size chart, actual size is smaller"
Order larger sze
"I'm disappointed in the quality. I was expecting it to look a little nicer. This is a gift as a ""Good luck on your new job""  but  I feel disappointed. Cute design though. I recommend not showering or sleeping in it"
Garbage! !!!  I ordered the black floral skirt..... what I got was a huge chevron print skirt made out of the cheapest thinnest material!!!! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!
"I ordered these shirts in both black and white and both of them had holes in them when I received them.  If it wasn't for that, they would have been convenient and I would have liked them."
"My other pair of Reefs fit comfortably well,  so I was looking for the same comfort. Unfortunately,  the thin strap and small fit makes the flip flop a big flop. Still love my black reefs"
"I have worn ASICS GEL-Kahana 6 shoes for a while now and like them a lot, but I though maybe it was time for me to step up to a top-of-the-line shoe.  I expected them to be lighter and more comfortable, with better support, stability, durability, and/or cushioning.  I found none of these expectations to be true.  They weigh the same, are slightly stiffer due to the fake-leather (yellow) material, and I couldn't detect any improvements in stability, support, or cushioning.  Admittedly, I didn't wear them in a ""running"" situation because I didn't want to mess them up at all, so I don't know for certain about these last three aspects, and of course there was no way for me to learn about durability without keeping them.  I didn't keep them.  They're so much more expensive than Kahana 6 that I sent them back and bought another pair of the Kahana 6's instead."
It is no where mentioned that it is a skin tight t-shirt. I ordered large but the size of the t-shirt is way smaller than the usual US size L-shirts. I am not sure if I can use this at all
This was a horrible purchase ....Worst top ever super cheaply made
Fabric is too cheap/thin. Going back.
"Very thin material, and unless you're tall and skinny and short waisted, not a good buy.  Could be I'm too short and long waisted for this to work.  Doesn't look as it does in the photo.  The hubby said ""throw it away"".  I'm not going make the company take all the blame...but be sure to buy a size up and if you're short, be prepared to get them hemmed."
"Fell apart within a couple of weeks. Got a replacement. the new one fell apart about 3 weeks later. The straps are flimsy.

However, I gave it a two star because it is super cool looking. (As long as the straps don't fall off.)"
Didn't like and run very small!
Quality sucks.  Belt is already broken and we haven't even had it 6 months.  First the loop came off and then the metal part broke. Bummed because it was a nice belt.
"I've had this thing less than 20 days and have carried no more than a single pound in it at any time and the clip for the strap completely fell apart after gently lifting it this morning, 100% empty. The stitching is now unraveling and the bag itself is falling apart (now afternoon). After I ordered this product and saw the estimated shipping date (a week+ to a month) I looked at where it was coming from and sure enough, China! I figured i'd see how it goes and here I am today greatly inconvenienced by this cheap product."
"Skimpier than expected,more like panty hose than lingerie"
"They sent me a second pair after the first one wasn't stitched right and one of the corners flopped over.  Now the second one isn't completely stitched all the way up the seem either.  Some white sticks out under the dark black.  These are expensive shoes for how sloppy they're thrown together.  I love this style, but I'm disappointed in the quality of the stitching."
"The chain was SUPER short. As a bit of a heavier girl, this fit me almost like a choker. Overall quality seemed fine, but the length of chain cause a return from me."
"Amending my original review as we do not have a happy camper, it turns out (left original one below). Some kids hate the feeling of stitches or tags on their clothes (and it's very normal), mine does too. Well at the beginning he jumped for joy, but getting dressed in the mornings is back to normal as these socks are all ""hairy"" inside, and they DO have stitches so my kid can only wear them inside out. OK, the stitch at the toes is not as bulky as regular socks, but it's still enough to bother.
**Neither had I until these arrived! Apparently it is quite common for kids to have a sensitivity issue on their skin (long explanation by a friend's psychologist), and tags and stitches or bumps on clothes are not just an annoyance and we parents must be more understanding.  So I had mentioned to the little man I had ordered this and when they finally arrived it was like Christmas again! He loves them and I love not being late to school in the morning because of socks!**"
My son used this book bag for a few months before it ripped. The quality was not good.
"The shoes are so cute! Love them, but I wish I had known how they fit. They are definitely not made for wider feet. they fit so good all the way until the strap by the toes. I would say for slimmer feet only :/"
a bit more sparklieeee that I would like  they seem more plain in picture--guess I shoud have checked them out in person before purchase.  Price and fit are fine and I will wear them
It's fairly attractive but the quality isn't great. I'm keeping it bcuz I like it's look with an accompanying bracelet. I won't wear it by itself & I wonder how masculine it looks for a man. The drawstring makes it a fit for anyone but the strings will hang long on a smaller wrist
Just another pair earrings.  They're serve the purpose.
"Was a little large and then when i washed it, it shrank like crazy.  Is just a bit too small for me now."
cute but small.
Very cool looking especially the sole.  Runs small in length. Not a lot of arch support but enough.
The fitflop flipflops fit me fine; however the same size in full toe shoe or boot was too small.
Not as absorbent as I would like so I like never use it. Nice if I dry off with a towel first then toss this on for walking through the house while I get ready though.
I was disappointed with the arch support in these. They were supposed to be good for those with foot issues and arthritis but I find they don't provide much arch support.
This dress is made with an extremely high neck line. The advertised dress is not like that. Although the fabric and fit of the dress is good
"As far as basic white socks go these are good, well stitched, hold up well.  Nothing crazy or fancy here though."
"Very thin runs small. I bought three packs. One of the packs can in different packaging was a large but more like a medium. If You want a tank that shows off your belly button buy these it's perfect!
Won't purchase again."
It doesn't make me feel funny when I walk but to open them and put them on is very difficult  To the point that I asked my hubby if he can put WD40 on them.
"I bought myself leggings for the first time and was pleased to see these came in extra small. This one seemed to be popular, at least it had many reviews, so I took a chance. When I tried them on after totally destroying the package they came in (theres no other way to get them out!) I was disappointed. The length was a little long (Im 53) and caused the knees to look baggy. The waist was a little large too and caused a gap thats uncomfortable and doesnt look good either. The rest of the leggings was skin tight and showed the panty line in all places. The color I bought is a basic gray that goes with almost anything but its a pity that they don't fit my build - maybe they are better for other people. I paid more for these leggings than I did for Calvin Klein leggings that fit me perfectly."
It's my fault - I was guessing at the size. I will order another one in a larger size!!
"Not quite as rough looking as I thought ,but very good product,no complaints......."
Love Fit Flops but they are getting too expensive for slippers !
"I was measured for a bra at one of my local department stores and since being an odd size, there was a very limited selection. I thought I would give online shopping a shot. I must say I was quite excited when I saw this little package in the mail.

This bra is pretty comfortable, the straps are pretty thick and the material is stretchy. I would say this is a bra you cannot wear with a scoop neck shirt or any other lower cut type of shirt. Also, while the bra itself looks like any other bra; it gave my breasts a weird shape. I'm not sure if this is because of a lack of underwire or just this particular bra. Because of the odd look I only give this 3 stars.

I would recommend this bra for anyone to just wear for sheer comfort and not looks or good support."
"I travel to many countries for work and I like this product to stash some cash and an extra credit card and a photocopy of my passport. (You definitely cannot put your passport in it though of course). I purchased this one to replace my old one that I have washed so many times and has a stain on it. This one is a larger than my old one though and is a little too big for comfort. Theoretically you could wear it on the band under your arm, rather than in the center of your chest, and that might be more comfortable given its size, but I'm used to wearing it in the center of my chest. So I'm still using my old one instead."
the sandals are great but very expensive
A little bit large for me.
"Del Rossa garments are very comfortable and the robe is no exception.  If you are short, 5' to shorter 5'4, this robe will come to your knee.  I also purchased two of them in the wrong size - waaaay too big.  My bad.  Order one size under your regular size and I think you will be fine."
kept these but did not like the fit.  Too loose.
"I like this babydoll, but on my small frame, I feel like I'm swimming in it. To tie the front two ribbons together, I have to also tie in some actual fabric to get it to close properly. I ordered a small but it does feel/look a bit big. The thong is really cute, but again, larger than I thought & suuuuper stretchy. It's also a deeper blue than the picture."
It don't look like on the pic looks like I paid 9$ for it hope it keeps up to my fishing
That do not last. Had them for 3 months and they started coming apart.
This runs true to size no need to order up size
Returned them they are more type than grey.
"Liked them at first, nice style, color fit.  Make loud skwishING sound when I walk."
"Last year I bought my size (7N) to get a plush slipper for my sensitive feet.  The length was just a little long -- but the ""narrow"" was a laugh.  Over time, the sideways play has become downright DANGEROUS when walking through the house or outside with my dog.

So ... since the foam part (which takes a short while to conform to your foot) is so nice, I decided to buy the so-called ""narrow"" in a full-size down.  Really, a 6 1/2 would be much better -- but it is not offered.

I think this will end up working alright -- but far from great for me."
"I wanted to love these boots, but they're a real hassle to get on and off. the shaft of the boot is a bit too narrow- it's like trying to put on a scuba suit two sizes smaller than comfortable. once my foot makes it past the shaft of the boot, the fit is excellent. the boots are very good at retaining heat, and I have no doubt that they are completely waterproof. I wish there were pull up handles on these puppies, or a zipper... maybe I'll incorporate them into my fitness routine- it takes a lot of physical effort to get these boots on and off."
"This shoe fits true to size and appears exactly as pictured. However, simply by holding the shoe you can tell how cheaply it is made. It offers some motion control but minimal cushioning. I would not recommend this shoe as a running shoe. I wore these shoes for one week until I could go buy better shoes."
Tight on thighs
"I'll add to or change this review when Amazon finds one that isn't dipped in something that smells strongly of toxic chemical fumes. Every packing parchment stuffed into it, every plastic strap wrapping, every inch of it inside and out had a poisonous aroma. My other recently ordered Nicole Lee rolling business tote had a faint ""new"" smell that quickly faded. I know these products ship from China, which is unfortunate given that this company claims a California base. The more I read about Chinese bags sent overseas I am learning others have experienced this scary, pungent odor that would not go away for a long time, or at all, with or without other interventions. I've tried to use fewer man-made materials and this purchase reminded me why! Amazon is currently working with me to secure a replacement that is odorless. It is a cute design and I'm interested in collecting more of them such as the hard sided carry on luggage case. I advise that if you're ordering this from Amazon you communicate about this potential chemical issue if it's something you care about."
Ordered for my brother. He is a size 12. I got him a size 11. But still fit big.
"58"" is tight, and these 60"" are way to big."
"Hello,
 I always days because my daughter wanted it. She loves it. It's a gag fine item for her.
Blessings,
Joy"
"The look of this skirt is fine and it's pretty easy to iron. But, be warned, the material is rather rough. I discovered this most pointedly while riding a bike yesterday. That combination of events can't happen again. But, it's not dangerous if you're just walking."
They didn't fit as expected . Not my favorite jeans . I had to return them. They were a bit stiff for me. However they were a true black.
"I re-ordered a 1X to accommodate my bust line then the blouse was too large.
L still love the style but the figure isn't changing."
"The product material is great, sizing runs a bit small. The size just makes it as described."
I bought this for my mother who is very happy with it & it seems to be holding up after several months.
Nicely made but I guess I will never get used to the way to long inseam. I returned them!
Size 26. The color is a darker blue than pictured but still very nice. I like them and they fit great everywhere except the tummy area is kind of tight.
"It's probably the best I'll be able to find for night driving glasses, but I'm not 100% satisfied. I wish there were glasses that could cut the glare and not darken my visibility. These glasses do cut a bit of the glare, but they also make it darker, so you just gotta pick which is safer for you and others."
"This bra is alright, a bit itchy"
The Latch on the top of the watch to the chain just fell off so now it has no chain
Beware of the color.  This is actually a darker pink than in the picture.  It's okay.
"It's a beautyfull shoe, but not so confortable."
"nice boots not as good as quality as i thought, i sold them later, be sure to check the size chart and order them bigger than what use usally wear..."
Just not staying in place
"I am 6'5"" 188 lb, athletic build.  I bought a medium for part of a halloween costume. The fabric is pretty snazzy and the shirt fits snug enough to show musculature, which is what I wanted for the costume.  I expect the next size up would be loose around the abs, which wouldn't be the effect I want for the costume.  You can see in the model photo on the website, the model is pretty athletic looking, and they are wearing size that is somewhat looser around the abs.  They are probably a lot more comfortable.  I find the shoulders tight, especially where my arms emerge from the torso of the shirt I hope it stretches out with wear.  for a costume, not so big a deal.  the other thing that I find more annoying is that the shirt is just very short.  if I raise my arms it rises up and my abdomen is uncovered.  If I hold very still, it looks good for the costume, but my arms may go numb shortly."
My daughter is 5 and wears a 5/6. We ordered the size 6 in these so they would hopefully last the majority of the school year. They are huge! Definitely don't size up. Quality was good and they're a decent fit for a little girl. We might try again in a smaller size.
"I'm a big fan of Kensie dresses, and I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't get over the hemline. The unevenness looked more like a mistake than a cool, modern retake on a hemline. I love the material though... so comfortable!  The off-center/asymmetrical seam down the front was cool too. But that hemline, sigh.  It caught both my mom and my husband off guard, and not in a good way. More of a head-scratcher reaction than  I am okay with.  I even ordered the dress in multiple sizes and colors to see if those would make the hemline appear differently. No go on all. When the dress is laid out flat, the hemline looks purposeful, but when the dress is hanging on your body, it looks like a kid took some scissors to the bottom. I sent the dresses back. Oh well."
This shirt was very big on me but was good quality. I would purchase again in a smaller size.
Somewhat small and snug compared to other pants.
The shirt is cute but made very thin. Washed as directed and the seams twisted and it just doesnt fit as nice.
I purchased these for my grandson.  He said they seem to be okay.
Its okay .. Its beautiful but not sturdy .. Broke on day three
"This is a beautiful shoe that cannot decide if it is a clog or slide.  The color is nice and the design is great EXCEPT ....the heel cup is too low, does not contain the heel.  Shoes were returned!"
I'm returning this ankle boot only because the grey had too much taupe in it.
"I have worn many Teva shoes. This is the first one that gave me heel blister because the back is too stiff. I want to like these shoes a lot, but I can't wear them comfortably more than an hour."
"Interestingly these fit a bit better than the Khaki ones I bought. They are cheap but comfy. No great, not bad. But a good deal."
"Pendant it sweet, pretty colors, as pictured. Chain is flimsy and the clasp broke the first time I wore it."
"Comes with a big sticker on the side, ""contains chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects"" that California requires it to put on.  If you're outside California, you may not receive that sticker, so FYI that there are carcinogens in the product."
The black on black polo shoes pitch perfect just at the brown and tan has a snug tight fit to be 11 and a half day as well but overall I'm happy and satisfied may consider and returning for a size 12 which I know will be too big.
"For an XL size, they seem kind of small. Based on the instructions for what size to order and after reading some of the comments, I went with XL rather than L even though I fell into the L range. I was a little surprised that they were as snug as they were. They felt good at first, even being on the tight side, but after about twenty minutes they began to feel rather tight and claustrophobic. The fabric is okay, though I would have preferred it be more breathable. All-in-all, these aren't bad compression sleeves, but they aren't the best I've tried. If you order, you may want to get the next size up if you are close to the end range of one size or on the edge of one size and the next."
It's okay but a lot thinner fabric than expected. We expected it to be as thick and cushiony as a smaller Shemagh.
I really like the shoe. Cushion is great. But its a little tight in the toe area. So I don't use it on long runs.
These boots are cute and the reason I am giving this product three stars is due to its sizing. I am normally a size 9. I ordered a 9 and it was too large...I am returning them today and will order an 8.5 or 8 hopefully they will be a better fit... I will definitely keep you updated.
"pretty, and lacy. It is short in length, have to wear a string tank top under it."
I purchased these same boxerjocks back in 2012 and wear them under my shorts while working out.  This time around I found they are not as tight as the previous ones ordered.  The waist is not as snug as before which makes it feel less supportive to me.  I still own 3 of  the original ones I purchased in 2012 and they are going strong and have a bit more compression to them.
"These were a good value, as a more well-known brand is at least four times higher in price. The socks are cute. Like the lace and button trim at the top. I bought these in four colors. But I live in Florida so I will probably only wear them late fall to early spring, so the price was right. My only complaint is that I wish the fabric had more ""give."" I have athletic calves, and they are somewhat tight, as others have mentioned."
"I sent this dress back. I loved the material used but the torso length was way too small for me. The skirt started and flared out just above my waist. I was hoping it would sit where Anna's did...on her hips. Also, the torso width was too big so you can imagine what that looked like. I was disappointed."
These are very small.  Best suited to a very young child.
"Pants were huge, but sleeves were too snug,"
Runs large. Size down one size.
Pretty decent. But not that comfortable.
Nice &warm but i don't like all the strings off yarn on inside of sock.  Wouldn't order again.
"Normally I would love it, the fit is good but the material is itchy and one of the thing I have always loved about Lucky brand is the comfort of the material used.  This particular shirt is scratchy a bit so not as comfortable as I am used to from this brand."
"Production is not very good, looks like a very cheap gloves. When I wear gloves, suture gloves make my hands ache. Suture is not so neat. In China look like gloves perhaps as long as 20 dollars."
"This shoe is not typical LifeStride quality. I have other pairs of LifeStride shoes in this size that are comfortable and well-made. These, unfortunately, are neither. The material is very thin and stiff and feels cheap. The shoes run a bit small and rub on parts of my feet after just a few minutes. I am returning these."
I'm a mechanic and these rings work pretty good. Gave 3 stars because the rings stretched out from getting oil on them. Also the blue and black ring fell apart after wearing for 2 weeks.
The shoes were way too big and had to be returned.
They fit and are comfortable but they aren't cute. They also look cheap.
Way to pricey for such thin material. Wore a few times but is so wide in the shoulders and low. Doesn't work with young kids who pull on you all the time. Another Patty boutik item going in the mission box. Bummer.
bought these for my wife so she would not use mine ... loves them very comfortable.
Im happy  they are great just a little big but Ill make them work!
"Not quite ""denim""!!  Having back pockets and gold stitching doesn't constitute denim! They look more like navy blue leggings.

If you're looking for DENIM jeggings, keep looking.

I was looking for comfortable jeggings to wear on an overseas trip. 20+ hrs of traveling and these were great!  Although I could have just bought some standard leggings and been just as comfortable.

The sizes are WAY off!  I am 5'4""/190 lbs/46 in hips/35 in waist... I ordered an XL. I had about 1.5-2 in of excess material in the hips and bunching around my ankles...AND that's AFTER pulling the waistband practically up to my bra line!!!

I probably could have ordered 2 sizes down!  But definitely at least one size."
Didn't care for the purse
But a large is too baggy
Really cute but not what I was expecting. No stretch to it and fit snug around the bust. Nice color though!
Nice hoodie  a little thin but black tank under it looks good.
"I liked this bra for the most part, except how it positioned my breasts. It pulled them apart, and made them ""pointy"". I didn't like the shape of the cups, or how it made my breasts appear. The support and size was good, but I returned the item because of the odd shaped cups."
"Comfort was pretty good. Fit was as expected. Durability, not so much. I didn't get much use out of these before they began to fall apart, not even three months worth. But you get what you pay for, right?"
"These run a good whole size too big, so order accordingly. Great ankle support, in fact after the first day I was a little sore just because they are very stiff as one would expect with new boots."
"Fit more like a burlap sack, but I was able to return it."
"Weight :  Approx: 11 oz
Cushion : Medium
Toe Box Room : Narrow
Zero Drop : No
Heel to toe drop : Not published
Control : Multi-layer mid-foot overlays

Miles : 27.6 (~3 miles on Treadmill)
Tasty?  Its a fun shoe, but not perfect. I purchased this shoe to wear while running a long trail that dishes up soft, to hard, to rocky terrain, and back again. The trail is relatively flat, with a few hills and grades mixed in just to spice things up. And while the ATV19 out performed my Altra Torin's on the rocky terrain they performed the same or worse over the long haul. In fact I experienced blisters on one or both feet after every run except one. To put that in perspective, I have never ever ended a run with any blisters in the Altra Torin's.  My non-blister run was a short 3 miler. They are also heavy at 11oz, and after running in lighter shoes for long periods its noticeable. All of that said, I have to be honest and tell you I took these out on a rainy day through a muddy trail run and they were just plain fun. I stayed in place on the trail and hammered the ground with boyish pleasure. So they remain in my rotation for the moment as a fun trail shoe, but I am also prepping to do some trail runs in a pair of Altra Lone Peak 2.0."
"Not very fit, size is too small"
they're great at first but they are pretty much a no go after about 2 months of barely using. But the design is fine and the lights are bright. Theyre pretty cool.
"The only reason I didn't give this product more stars is that it has hooks in the back, and the straps are arranged so that the hooks MUST be fastened from the back.  I just couldn't do it.  The bra is not very stretchy, which makes it a little harder to get on over your head, but that is the reason the support is so good.  It is a nice bra.  Just for reference, I wear a 42C, and the XL was about one size too small for me, so I had to send it back."
"These are really pretty earrings. I looked at the picture before buying, and, based on that,  thought that the size was going to be a bit larger. They are very colorful, though, and that's why I liked them in the first place. Very unique!"
Not of greatest quality
"The elastic is very stretchy, but it's also quite thick, even with nothing in it. When this is empty it's nearly as thick as my other 2 compact wallets fully loaded."
This is a cute dress but in this wine color you can see through it
"Loved them until I washed them ( No drier, I hang dry) The long length shrank drastically and are now to short. Cut offs maybe...."
"This wallet has a lot of compartments, and space for every card you might have but...it is very hard to get the cards out of their slots and if you utilize all the card slots the wallet is very bulky. I would recommend getting an RFID card holder and not this wallet."
"Slightly deceptive description and overpriced, but we made it work for our purpose.  9 year old daughter needed old lady glasses for a play.  I searched children's costume glasses and this came up, but the packaging states 14+, so it's kind of misleading that this is one of the results when searching for children's glasses.  For my 9 year old, these are too big.  They slip down on her nose a little, but it will work for the play she's in.  Also, I think the picture on the website used to be different.  The frames previously looked silver when I ordered them, but the current picture shows their true color -- brass.  I was surprised when they came in a ""Santa eyeglasses"" package.  Again, the glasses are okay for a costume, but I thought the ad was a little misleading in terms of frame color and suggested age range."
"After looking at the size chart, I ordered a large for my 2 year old but the costume is way too long. I was also surprised and disappointed it doesn't have a tail, I should have done more research on it. I wish it had more detail on the body portion. But it does seem to be good quality and warm enough for Halloween night."
"If the size were to fit like they are represented, I'd wear these a lot more.  I have to use socks to keep them snug.  They're very comfortable to walk in, but it's irritating trying to keep them up on my feet."
Sleeves are long but torso is short. Pants fit okay.  Very soft. Overall will only work for a little while because she will out grown it fast because the shirt is shaped funny.
"Nice swimsuit, however it states it has underwire and it does not.  The only wire it has is on the sides for shaping. Would have given it 5 stars if it had the underwire."
These shoes are so cute and well made. Maybe my daughter has chubby feet (or her feet swelled in the heat) but after a few hours she had marks all over her feet from these shoes. The leather doesn't stretch. We used them a hand full of times and decided to not use them any more.
"Fits more like a man's t-shirt than a lady's: narrow all the way down,and a bit too long. Good color and material, though."
This is just ridiculously too big
This is a soft and comfortable tee. The colour isn't exactly as pictured and it has a boxy fit but other than that worth the price for a quick easy Tee.
I was able to wear them for about an hour but after that they pinched so badly that I had to take them off.
"If only I could order this top in a larger size. I'm 5/7"", 120 lbs, c-cup and normally wear a medium, which fits great. In this top I'd go up a size to a large so it wouldn't be quite so form fitting. It's really a nice top and the color would work with light jeans (I like a monochrome look). But the size I got? (There's only one size.) It fit me like the photo, which I'm ok with if I'm working out, but I wanted this for casual wear. So back it goes."
Personal shower gift
Did not look exactly as pictured. I still wear it though.
I had to give them to my daughter! They ran big and didn't feel very comfortable.  My daughter hasn't worn them yet but the size should work for her. Very cute shoe however.  A smaller size would have been perfect
"I ordered a small, but should have an extra small with this dress. I looks a little too big, but is pretty comfortable."
not my favorite color
"It is as i expected.  I am 5'8"" and 170.  I wear a 10 -12.  Eventho the other reviews said it was too small, i decided to take a chance.  The dress is too short for my height, so i bought some dark brown tight shorts that match the brown in the arm & leg bands.  I have thick thighs so the dress was very tight at the bottom.  Since i got the shorts anyway, i decided to take out the seams on both sides on the bottom.  Now it fits well enough for the parties coming.  The material of the dress has NO give."
Love the shirt but small is more like extra small.
They are platform sandals stylish for the summer
"I normally wear a 40DD, I ordered a 40DD.  It is not something I can put on alone, my fiance had to close the hooks.  It is snug as a 40 but it is supportive and doesn't feel like it will loose its support that way, its not uncomfortable tight just a good bit of snug.  The cups are weird though, very Madonna like a virgin or old style 50s pointy bras even on the DDs.  And for all the women who have one slightly larger then the other, its kinda evident with this bra which is which, but I think it'll do the trick for the wedding dress. And hey, its not the $80+ dollars like the bridal boutiques so I'm good with it.  The under wires are kinda weird and I actually had to fully bend over and lift myself into the cups, they sit a little higher than most of my other bras.  And it stops above your belly button like 3 inches, and I'm a short 5 foot.  So of course my muffin top became a fairly apparent cheeto roll, but with the spanex it all evens out in the jelly department, lol."
The cups are too thin
"These socks are smaller than the ones that they are replacing. They will work and perhaps they will stretch a little. On cold New Hampshire nights in front of the fireplace, they are just the thing to keep my feet cozy."
"A very nice piece to add special charms. It hangs nicely, and the finish is shiny. The only issue I have is the clasp is a hook instead of a sturdy clasp. I hope that it does not unhook and I lose my charms. Also the front is pretty, but the back is hollow."
I absolutely loved this skirt until I received it.  I just think it would have looked nicer if it was like a jersey type of fabric instead of complete spandex.  The description on the site say 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex seems more spandex to me...I had ordered other skirts from here with the same exact description and they were so cute and perfect the second time around Not So Good...
I don't hate it.  I bought it for my cruise.  It's thin and a little shorter than I would like. I'm 5'5.  I will have to wear something underneath.  The material is thin.
"Ir is a little snug for an XL size shirt.  If your chest is a size 44 like me, order the XXL size instead."
"I work in a greenhouse on my campus so I only wear these for a couple hours out of the day daily. I was interested in these for the wider calf, and it was a perfect fit for me. I can wear my skinny jeans or joggers, and there's still a little room around my calves. The only downside was the insole -- it slid around too much for my liking, so I just took it out completely. I never replaced it either so there's mild discomfort after long hours of wear. But I've had these for almost 4.3 months now, and they've held up well. I've had water deflected onto them, clumsily stepped into buckets of water, etc. and I don't get wet. Great boots overall.

EDIT: these have finally developed tears after approximately 7.2 months of use which is a bit saddening. So I guess it's one of those you get what you paid for deals? So you could safely buy these for maybe 2-3 seasons worth of rain."
I had these shoes in a caramel color and loved them. I'm so disappointed with the black!
"Love it, but a tad on the tight side.  Worried that washing it will shrink it smaller than it already is.  Hopefully it will stretch over time, but until then I can't wear this if I want to do something else with my hands, like trying not to fall over ice skating."
"Very pretty but NOT UK-sized, and therefore too small when you're in the G, H, HH cup range (in UK sizes, like say for Freya or Fantasie bras)."
Size up....
beautiful but the clasp was very hard to open and close. i am sure its meant to keep from falling off but the tween i bought it for can not open the clasp alone.
"I ordered a size medium. I'm 5'5"" and 155 lbs. The dress was pretty baggy. Comfortable but really baggy. I could've ordered a size small. So I returned the medium size because I don't like it that baggy. I wanted something more fitting since I'm getting married so I ended up just buying something else."
"This is my second Bali bra and just like with the first, it tends to fit on the smaller side. I have a large bust and was happy to find a colorful, attractive bra in my size. The bra feels off in both the waist and cup. The straps are a little dinky too. It you are no bigger than a C, then I think this bra would work but for me, I feel like I'm spilling out and the straps come loose throughout the day."
Good and perfect
"This is a very nice looking jacket, you can dress it up or down.  I wear a size 14 so I order XL and it was to small, so I had to order another one in XXL I hope it fit.  Gave this one to my daughter."
This boots run small. I wear size 6.5 and I usually get my boots 1/2 size larger. The 7 was still kind of tight.
"From afar it looks great, I have a fair amount of compliments from people.  The problem I see is that I use it as a real workout watch, and the material is a bit too thin for my taste, it felt like it digs into my skin some. For the price, I cannot complain. if you are using it as a fashion piece, by all means, but before this I had a Motosports with a good quality silicon band, and it never felt like it digs into my wrist."
Super cute but was small in the chest area.
Nice soft feel but they run a little tight. The higher end Sportoli men's socks that sell from $11-$12 per pair are the best and worth the cost.
The shoes are very pretty but not really well made.  They run small so I would recommend ordering a size larger than your actual size.  They would be great for a costume or cosplay but not for everyday wear. You get what you pay for.
Is beautiful but too large
not so well made.
"Could've been worse, I guess. I was expecting different material. Honestly, I only bought these because the pants I really wanted were out of stock."
This really is mini and will not fit an iphone 10 inside. I was hoping to fit the phone and a small wallet. No such luck. Will need to send it back.
"They are gorgeous, it is a shame that, as the other reviewers wrote, they do fit too small. I wear size 10, but the 10 on these boots is hardly a 9. I decided not to order size 11 because I am afraid that is not going to fit right. I am really sad because they seemed pretty durable and the leather felt amazing."
bit more pink than purple
"I ordered this in my regular size, but it was at least a half-size too small. Seemed like an okay shoe otherwise. Would have served well for my intended use as a shower shoe at the gym. I found another shoe I liked better so I didn't bother exchanging for a bigger size."
"It's a fine product, fits well on the legs but I wish had a rubber band in the waist to fit better"
Too small for me  but it have comforter
They fit my foot just fine but that's all couldn't wear decent socks or tuck in jeans. I returned them.
These are very cute but they run large. I would recommend buying a half size smaller.
"I had been searching for a nice, neutral sandal for a black dress. I ordered my regular size in these (9), but they were way too tight when I got them in the mail. The toe strap was EXTREMELY snug and narrow. I wish I could have made these work because they go with everything!"
"I got this to adjust the size of my 8mm watch band https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A0ADPI8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

The circular table design to keep whatever you're working with level is a novel idea but poorly designed for working with smaller items. My 8 mm watch band is very thin and, while the table can raise high enough to level it with the pin remover, the part of the tool that keeps the pin remover in place is blocked by the circular table and can't get close enough to actually remove the pin. I had to manually place and hold still the wristband to remove the pin, making that feature fairly useless.

All in all it works, just wasn't as easy or convenient to use as I had hoped."
"It appears more gold in person than in the picture, which I thought was nice. However, the pieces are linked together and it lies odd on collarbones. Definitely not for bony girls."
"good quality, but they say made in Colombia"
Kind of disappointed in how flimsy the material is.
"The shorts are of great quality and a perfect summer style. Note, this style runs large. You may wanted to go a size smaller."
"Waist is too large.  The other Lee Relaxed Fit fit me perfectly, but the waistband gaps in the back by a couple of inches.  I probably could have ordered a smaller size."
I found a similar one at Ross at a much lesser price.  A friend of mine liked it so may just give it to her.
"Hard to find these that fit a busty girl. I always hope though. And ordering the ""plus"" size always seems too loose and not enough support.
So these ""fit"" but the back starts to roll down/up as you move around. I did keep them and will wear them around the house, but not out under another top as I was planning."
"Didn't like it. Too small and I usually wear medium. It looks and feels cheap, returned it."
snug in the chest so if you got boobs size up!
The necklace is good. It is fairly well-made and a great price for the quality. Shipping was fast and right on time through PRIME.
seems to fit a bit tighter in the calf for hubby/washes well/not as good quality as Hanes us to have.......
"Based on the reviews I expected this to fit really well but the bust was just weird. The chest pads are really thick, like a push-up bra. But since they were made regardless of taking bust size into account they don't fit at all. I'm only a D cup and it looked no felt ridiculous so I imagine anything larger would be impossible. It also felt a little odd that the front and back were so similar. The material was quite nice though."
A tad too large
"I am 5'7"" and it's a few inches too short."
I love the colors and the way the dress was put together.  It's very becoming.  I would highly recommend this dress.  I couldn't be happier.
"It's okay.  The point at the bottom of the shirt is not centered!  It fits well, but with the point being off centered, it doesn't have quite the slenderizing silhouette it should have.  Poor quality control, in my opinion, for it to be off centered, and at the price I paid, it should not have been made this way."
"The arms are super long and it's long. I think after a while the bottom would stretch because of the ,material. It's cheap though"
The shoe fits but slips off a little and squeaks a little. Not as comfortable as I thought they would be.
A little small for my 2 yr old. But it will have to do
"quality is fine, but the size is off. too small"
The shoe was really cute but they were a little uncomfortable in the toe area. Maybe because of the almond shape. Perhaps if I had gone up a size they would have been more comfortable. I ended up returning them because I was looking for simple black shoes with a strap that would be comfortable to wear all day long. These are not them. However I would consider reordering them in a fun color to wear for special occasions when looking for style over comfort.
"I love how it looks, it's just beautiful, but the chain broke the second time my wife wore it. Still she likes it so we didn't return it."
"If you have been blessed with dainty feet, you could probably get away with your true size. If you're cursed with wide/slightly wide feet, I would highly recommended going 1 full size up. I am a size 9 & went with a 9 1/2 & my poor big toes go numb after a few trips to the copy machine. They are beautiful, classy heels. If you heed my warning you will loves these pumps!"
"Fit as expected, super cute shoes. The memory foam on the inside wore out very quickly, however. Not sure if I would purchase again, but they are certainly adorable!"
Cute shoes but they run smaller than expected.
"To narrow at foot rise. Measured 3 pairs (sizes 8\8.5 and 9), the length is as expected but can't wear it, really narrow. I have regular rise and didn't expected that wouldn't even put on my size :("
"They fit well, but the material creates constant static cling so my skirts and dresses stick to it awkwardly."
"These boots fit small.  They aren't are comfortable as the leather ones either but they look good.
I wouldn't buy them again though."
Not really navy looks like someone stepped Ina puddle. First order was replaced 2nd shoes looked better I only cept them because they were comfortable & I'll step Ina puddle anyway
They are a decent workout tank for the price. Thin material and not bad for a workout tank. The tank does shift when on elliptical or arc trainer to left...Get a Good Quality Sports Bra to wear underneath...
The jacket is too tight but the skirt fits nice
"I love the look of these shoes, the design and all. However they fit small, bought a size 8 which is my size and they were really uncomfortable."
"I expected a better boot for the price. The style is nice the color good and the weight excellent. the boot lacks real comfort, I changed the liner for better comfort and fit."
Not real what I was looking for.  A little larger than a standard Velcro wallet.  Product materials seem good.
The quality is good I just wish the torso wasn't so long. I pretty much had to tuck it under my bra to keep the excess fabric from rolling over on it self. I would only recommend if you're going to wear with dresses.
Can wear these for very long.. gets very uncomfortable.. maybe i should have ordered a size larger? The quality seems pretty good though
it does not look as the picture
"This was so short it was more like a belt. I'm short, too -- only 5'0, so I can't imagine how this would be on a taller person. It was for a Halloween costume, so I was able to work with it, but it was way shorter than I expected.

On the positive side, it fit well around the waist with room to expand."
"Let me first give kudos to Amazon for making the return process effortless.  About the jeans, they are so, so cute I just loved them (if they had fit!).
Before buying these jeans, I took my measurements, read the reviews & comments, & asked questions here to get feedback from others.

Based on these factors: 5' 7"" 140 lbs.; comfortably wear a size 6, I tried size 26 x 32.  Way way too small - I exchanged them for 27x32.  Too small in the waist, but otherwise were okay; again, another exchange: 28x32.  They fit great in the bottom & hips area but tighter in the waist than I like.  Unfortunately, I can't get a 29x32 in the dark vintage wash, so I asked for a return authorization on them, but am still debating on whether to return them."
Not as much padding as I thought but its soft and comfy.
Very cheap material.  Feels like it is made of cardboard. It does have the felt on top.  It will do though.  You can't be choosy for the price.  It is like the saying:  You get what you pay for.
"I  had ordered this same tote from another vendor in  blue. It seems they are both just the same purses with an open top which has magnetic snaps, not really the tote that I was looking for. I should have paid more attention to the measurements in cms. I just assumed a tote would be bigger than a regular purse. Also this is not a shoulder bag either. It only fits over your arm. I will keep this one for a gift to someone. I should have cancelled it after I saw the blue one but it was too late. Cute but not what I really wanted."
"These shoes are cute and my daughter says they are comfortable. We have had them for maybe a month and they are already starting to fall apart. They aren't even the shoes that she wears every day. The velcro and band that tightens the shoe on her foot is all shabby looking. I wouldn't buy them again. Go for the more expensive brands, they definitely last longer than this. She had a pair of Timberlands before these and she grew out of them rather than the shoe falling apart."
"So, this toy was delivered to my job today about 2pm.  By 210pm, I had one side of a link removed and a bent pin.  I was so pissed because I thought this was the only pin in the pack, but found a plastic bag with 4 more remaining of varying sizes.  Be very careful, because this tool is flimsy and plastic like a toy, and the pins are very delicate.  As another reviewer mentioned, take care to line the pins up carefully or else you'll be replacing this tool after removing two links, as the pins break easily."
looks like real silver but i don't think it is
"I was a bit disappointed in the fit with this hat, I had ordered it in Gray and the fit and slouch was perfect. This one fit smaller and not much of a slouch."
"Nice in theory, but WAAAY thinner than expected. The white one is basically see through. Its also quite large so Im sending it back. Seems like its relatively ok quality."
"Fits great. Like the shirt, Washed up great - but it is starting to form little balls on the material."
"I like the fabric a lot, and the longer length of this tank. However, the V neck is way, way too low. I would be worried about falling out of the top. The molded cups are free floating, which is about the most awful idea ever for a woman's top."
This outfit is beautiful. Bought size 4T for my 3 year old (she's very slim but a bit taller than the average). The top fix perfect but the pants was a bit big.  The only reason this item is not getting 5 stars is because the leggings came with a few brown stains on it. Given the color of the leggings the stains were obvious.
Adorable but does not fit my daughter's shoulders because it is too wide. She can't keep it on which is very frustrating. She is now 3 years old (wearing 4-5T clothing) and it still doesn't fit her shoulders. The other annoying thing is that it doesn't have much storage room inside. The water bottle mesh on the side does not hold any type of cup size and is kind of useless. This part also fell apart after only a few months of use. Otherwise it is very cute for just carrying around some games or coloring books but don't expect to fit clothes or many toys in here.
Not nearly as big as advertised. Not what I was expecting and returned it.
"I wear a medium (4'11, 125 lbs), and after reading other reviews I decided to order an XL.
Pros: The bathing suit fit and was a nice color
Cons: There wasn't any support, I am a larger chested woman and this bathing suit did not have any support at all, it also was not as loose as I thought it would be. It is also very cheap material, I will be returning the bathing suit."
Loved this watch. Had it a little over a year and a half and it just now stopped working. Definitely not water resistant... will look into buying another possibly.
"Super cheap but not bad quality. Problem is it is SUPER smal, I ordered the XXL and they fir on my 11 year old niece, they are like a XS"
I received these today and immediately fell in love. They fit perfectly however the front of the shoe was squeezing my toes so bad I could never wear them. Very unfortunate
Didn't fit the way we thought.
I sent them back as they were too big for me and I found another pair at a cheaper price
"I love this purse! It's such a soft leather, and the design is exquisite. I am worried about the design getting snagged on things or just ripping from normal use."
Fits well. Will have to return because the color of the boots is very noticeable different.
It's a fine hat. Very thick. Lots of fabric. A little too big for my head.
"They're beautifully made shoes, very well constructed, as one would expect from a Timberland product. My husband is a size 12M, but these in size 11 fit him fine by length. Here's the trouble, though. Although he wears a medium, his feet are a bit narrow and the width was way too snug to fit comfortably. The good news, our son generally wears size 12 and his feet are more narrow than Dad's, and so the shoes fit him well.

Beautiful shoes, but adjust your sizing needs accordingly."
Not that pleased with it.
good looking shirt but very small and short in lenght
"I read the reviews and ordered 2 sizes up, but it was still too small. Other than that, the jacket is nicely made considering the price. It did take several weeks to be delivered as it was mailed from China."
"No cushion at all. Good for indoors, not the concrete jungle. Beautiful style color."
Too small for most men's watches
"The ring itself was cute, but I ordered a 7 and when it arrived it was a 6.5 in size 7 packaging."
"I would recommend ordering a size up, or else it may be too tight under the arms.  I'm a size 4, bought the small size, and I stretch the armholes over a wooden hanger when I take them out of the wash."
"Cute, but the chain broke quickly."
"I really wanted to love this backpack! I don't use purses anymore because I've found backpacks to be more functional and comfortable for me. It's very impressive looking and you will get a lot of compliments on its looks alone.  I've wanted it for the longest time, I like to wait for markdowns before buying anything. Finally, it was reasonable and I ordered it, and alas I sent it back. For starters there is very little functional space in the main area of the backpack. It has a really nice pouch- -you access it from the bottom of the bag- -that would be good for shoes, wet items, etc. The problem is it takes away space from the main compartment. The small pouch flap, kind of gets in the way of accessing the main compartment. The grab handle is metal and not padded so for someone like me with RA it's very difficult to grab and go. It actually hurt my hand and was one of the main reasons I returned it. I did like the waist and chest straps and they're useful and functional additions."
Everything was big...the shirt and the pants.  We didn't have any choice but to have my husband wear the shirt but we can't even return the pants because of the 30 days
I bought these for my teenage son who complained his feet hurt after walking 18 holes. He likes the fit but his feet still hurt after walking 18 in these.
"Delivery was quicker than expected, so def plus there. However, the color is more like a faded yellow. Like this garment may have been white at one point but it has that aged yellow look. Also, the ends are frayed and torn, the lace is torn. It's cute, but it looks more like they dug this from grandma's attic."
"This really surprised me.  I didn't expect so much for the small price.  It sparkles like a true Swarosvki glass.  It looks like it has thousands of facet cuts.  It doesn't look real but it does look like a very good costume piece.  I will buy from this brand again.

My normal ring size is 6 1/2.  I ordered a 6 because of the narrow band.  It fits perfectly.

*****Revised review:  I've had the ring for several days and now see why it was so inexpensive.  The stone is not set well.  It sits slightly above the frame of clear crystals.  Noticeable enough to bother me.  I will still wear the ring but probably not in bright light."
Just your basic cotton poly t.
Cut tight
"These shoes look VERY pretty and classic. The only complaint that they are kind of slippery on carpet. I read other reviews saying they are running small, so I ordered half size bigger. However, I feel they are running large or at least true to size. Need to send them back for a smaller size."
"I really wanted to love these... However, they run small and they don't hang quite right.  Funky Smell!!!!!! I have washed and febreeze them...can still smell it!!"
Itchy at the seams
Doesn't stay in place.
"This is a good quality shoe and the material is pretty.  It fits well.  I find the charm on the bow and the giant initials on the outside heels to be too much branding.  The vamp of these shoes comes up pretty high to the point of being too high for me.  There is no toe cleavage and the cut borders on matronly, IMO."
"The bottom half is great! It hides the faults of an aging body VERY nicely.  The top not so much.  It is a tie on and does not really offer the support needed, nor offer an attractive effect for the upper half of the torso. I think it would be fine for a younger person that perhaps did not have an ample amount of flesh around the upper half and has not had their figure become a victim of gravity yet."
"I was really excited to receive these boots however they are so narrow I can't even get my foot inside. Yes, I have thick legs compared to the average person but I should at least be able to get my foot in."
"Love the heel height and the look of the black velvet. I also liked that they send heel grips and a replacement heel pad. However the current heel pad is already partially worn down. I Wish I would've inspected the shoe to see if it was like that before I put them on , or if it happened in the few minutes I was trying them. Guess it's a good thing there are replacement heels as I'll need you them very soon!"
Worn for about 6 months and starting to fall apart.
"Good quality top, but runs Super Big and long"
"I read another review that said to order 1/2 size smaller---glad I listened because they were spot on.
The shoes are comfortable enough for short distances but i'll have to find some sort of insert to give them more padding.  I guess you get what you pay for.

The sole is cloth like so it slips easily on smooth/tile floors."
"This served the purpose for a formal affair. The shirt does not have french cuff link button holes. It is a good shirt for
 the money."
The shoe is beautiful but extremely narrow!!!!
Will work for what I want but shorter than  expected
Everything seems fine with it except around the stomach area where the fit is somewhat small
"The actual grey color on the shoes is darker than the picture. I think it is okay, but don't like it that much. It was returned."
"These shoes are absolutely gorgeous! I planned to wear them for a formal wedding in Texas. Tried them on as soon as they arrived in shipping. They were snug, but I could walk around the house and I was quite excited because they're so sparkly! Packed them in my suitcase, flew to Texas. Once I got to my hotel, I found that my feet had swollen a bit with flying, but then when I tried the shoes on, I couldn't even get my feet into them at all. I even slept in a cold room with my feet propped up all night. No luck. All of my other shoes still fit. For the wedding, I had to race out and buy another pair of shoes...same size, definitely not as beautiful. I tried the shoes back on when I got back home, but they STILL don't fit. It sounds strange, but I wonder if they shrunk during my flight. Anyway, my word of warning is buy the next size up...especially in the summer."
"LOVE the cover design!!!!!!! Aesthetically just what I was looking for. The quality, however, leaves MUUUUUUCH to be desired. sigh."
It's a little tight and I have tiny wrists! I can't imagine how anyone would wear this comfortably with bigger wrists. It is cute for the price but it took WEEKS to receive. Would probably be good for teenage girls.
"Love, love, love. Fit as expected. However back threads immediately started breaking."
"Hurt my feet if I wear them all day.  Good-looking shoe, though."
"These shoes are OK. They seem to fit fine, and eventually become comfortable. The mouth of the shoe is higher on the ankle that I thought, and at first it was bruising the front of her ankles when she wore them. They broke in a bit and that stopped, but it was disconcerting to see. Also, the mouth of the shoe is unexpectedly small and stuff, so my daughter is unable to put these shoes on herself as she just can't hold it open far enough. It takes adult strength, and it's still a tight fit. The shoes do seem quite durable, and she is pretty hard on shoes. I don't think we'll buy these again, but we don't hate them."
"This flip flop has a thick foam bottom, which makes it a little too ""chunky"" for my taste. Bought it so I could embellish the straps with beads, etc. Probably won't go through with that because the straps are taught when I have the flops on. Perhaps if I wear them in they'll get more comfortable."
Should haave checked with wife before ordering!
"First, the midnight/platinum is a gorgeous combination, and the leather seems high quality. But I couldn't even fit these on my foot. They are VERY narrow & hugged my arch like they were painted on. It is no wonder so many other reviewers complained of broken sandals- the sandals are not made for an adult woman's foot. I have never worn a size wide shoe, and I don't have a problem with the sizing of other Jack Rogers. I wanted to love them because I got them for a steal, but these are a no-go."
"I cannot complain about the quality of Dickie's trousers, only about their limited sizes.  My son wears these exclusively, and loves them.  Unfortunately, I happen to have a 35"" waist, and 31"" inseam, so I don't fit into their ""average"" size model.  36L x 32L are too big, and 34L x 30L are too small.  Nothing in between works either.  If you are a ""standard size"", then these may work well for you, if you're not, well they probably won't fit."
"Not quite happy with the fit, not sure if I need larger, smaller or something made more secure. For now it is good."
"I love the color and feel of this blouse however, the lace was a hot mess. I had to restitch pieces to each other by hand. It really isn't worth the bother to return it~ I would order Two sizes up. I do that with all the shirts on here and usually fits well. I would've given it 5 stars if not for the lace."
"It has a nice shape, but my daughter wears a size 10 and it fit perfectly. It probably would not fit size 12."
The waist fit fine but the leg and length were too large. It looks like I'm wearing highwaters. I'm going to roll them up or hem them
"These were very cute, but they were very tight around the calf.  If you are like me and have, let say a well defined calf then you might want a different boot.  I had to return them, just couldn't wear them.  But all and all the boot itself was great."
Just some color for her bracelet. Nothing special but it wasn't expensive either. Good for the amount paid.
"While attractive this sandal is going to require some break-in time. I purchased the red in size 6 and the problem is they are narrow at the toes. The strap in the toe area needs more room in the opening, really rubbing on the big toe, hahaha. So hoping they will stretch out. Also my feet feel hot in these, weird I know, but noticed while driving, so the jury is still out"
"The pants were about 10 inches too long.  Otherwise, the fit was perfect."
The necklace is cute and the structure is reasonably good aside from the colored flowers.  As I took the necklace out of the package on the flowers fell off.
"These sandals are just okay. The pair I got was dingy and the strap around the back of the heel won't stay up. They are insanely cheap so I'll probably just make them work for the rest of the summer and then trash them. If you're just looking to get a pair of sandals to work in the yard these are probably fine but if you are looking for a cute summer sandal, get something else."
It is a little snug around the top so it is not the most comfortable nightgown ever.
Elastic band is kind of small... my son is a tooth pick and these are tight on his calves.
The quality is nice but it is really small.
"I wasn't pleased with two of these onsies, they look cheap and washed out. Not sure how long they will last but will use them until they are done. Material isn't really soft either which was a little turn off for me. But I love the others, the colors are vibrant."
"These are fine for the price. They fit as expected for me. I don't give more stars because they seem too light. I could use flip flops with more weight and sturdiness to them, also with better arch support. The color is great though!"
I sent it back. The top did not fit well on me and I am a 34 D.
It looks better on the picture
For the price I can't complain but I will.  Don't get these
"I ordered a medium and the neck was too large to wear on one shoulder but instead I wear off both shoulders. The body of the shirt is also quite large. I twist it in efforts to gain some kind of body contouring. Although it's too wide, the length is that of a standard medium size. Hope this helps"
"Though these are very cute and fit as expected, they are very thin.  You can see through them so you definitely have to wear something dark underneath.  Most people don't wear under garments with leggings because they are form fitting, but because these easily stretch and the material is thin, you absolutely have to."
Didn't like the shorts. The mesh pockets kept popping out.
The skulls themselves look a little cartoonish and not so much like skulls but more like totem faces maybe?  But the price was right...
This is really cute and trendy. I had to order an XXXL.  Yes that's 3x. And it looks like a normal Medium or Large sized shirt. Keep that in mind and make sure to check reviews to see what kind of sizing you should get
She likes them. As described.
"I expected a little more quality.  The shoes wide=C, were roomy enough and comfortable but after wearing them for hours, my foot begins to slide to front of the shoe.  The shoe may be too big for me, but the Navy Color is pretty."
What people say in reviews are true it does remind you of a gumball prize only worth maybe 5 bucks I put mine on a sturdier chain I will keep mine and wear it I hate I paid 30 some dollars for it but I still like the colors. Will not buy again.
"I wear 12.5 so ordered 13 and my toes hang off the edge a bit.  Good shoe for $50, but no where near $80+ no matter what the ads say!  OK - The sizing issue was addressed via lacing / strap adjustments, but still say a good $50 shoe - not $80!"
"I didn't realize that below the bodice the front was so loose and is really only good for pregnancy and immediately postpartum. Now that I've lost most of my baby weight I only wear it to sleep because it flares out and looks really weird. Granted I bought the large size mainly for my bust size and the body size I should probably wear is probably a medium.
The top part has a strip that goes between your breasts that's bright red and throughout the day as your breast size changes from breast-feeding the red part sometime shows as it stretches which isn't a problem if you're wearing a top over it but it really can't be worn as a camisole with nothing over it."
"The top is too big and the skirt is too small. I bought a L.

I'm 34-28-38"
"I ordered a size bigger and it was still pretty small. For the price I paid, I was quite disappointed when one of the mesh eyes ripped the first day my son wore it. He still thinks it's a cool jacket ..."
"I loved the color, the style, and the print.  however, the wrap part of the dress was a very deep vee and didn't stay closed and the lining didn't line up correctly, even after pressing it a little.  I didn't feel I wanted to alter the dress to wear it."
I like these but they seem to be a bit smaller than the Bandeau I got earlier. Still happy I got them.
Fit really well but seeded to wear out a bit sooner than expected. Wore it every night after coming home from work. Comfortable
"These pants were well constructed, but the inseam was not 29 inches as on the tag and the fit was more relaxed than that of a straight leg Jean."
It's soft and lightweight.
"Art work is beautiful large scale as pictured. Material a bit stiff and very thin for sweatshirt material. Also, the distressed Tye- dye looks more like bleach mistakes. That is why 3 stars. For the $$$ expected more."
These are a fairly decent pair of water shoes.  They have a nice look to them and are comfortable for the most part.  They drain very well but small sand pebbles still get caught up in the sole area.  Expect to have to remove the inserts and rinse them and the shoes out very well after each use.
"My daughter who wore this for her birthday spilled lunch on it and even though I used bleach the stain won't come out. While it was larger than I anticipated she still enjoyed it, but now we won't be able to use it again :("
"It is a decent bag, but I am uncertain of the actual durability. It is made of a light nylon that does not instill confidence for more than clothes. The size is ample, just a little bigger would make it even better. The zippers roll well. Good length to the carry straps. Several pockets. The material would worry me if used at the stated 50 lb capacity often. Also... nylon is not uv resistant. That is, it degrades over time with sun exposure. Which makes it a poor choice for an away bag, in my opinion."
"This corset doesn't look quite as shiny in person as it appears in the pictures. And the back laces are shoe strings. Nevertheless, it appears to be well made and durable."
material is very see thru panty material. THIS IS NOT A SWIMSUIT
Too short for me. Wish the straps were adjustable. The material is a bathing suit-like spandex. Doesn't seem very breathable.
"Wearable but not for exercising but loinching around your house, as long as the stiffness and the whooshing sound it makes does not bother you. Am returning this."
"Size not as advertised! Also, lace is not stiff enough to stand up at collar! Thin material - not for winter."
these are really thin
"I like the shoe and think its great for work and walking around. It stretched kind of fast and I'm kind of regretting getting the extra wide, but my only complaint is that it tore around the padded cushion of the shoe that is by my ankle in about a week. I work in a office setting and was disappointed with this, I have bought this brand off shoes for years and love them for there long life."
Necklace broke the first time I wore it.
I can always buy Medium clothes and they always fit me. Not this time. Too small!
"The medium is too large and the small too small. Otherwise a great product. It does, however, pill more than I wish it would but very handy and stylist."
"A little to lite-weight and easy to tear, like on old barbed wire fence!"
Nice sweater but not even close to MINT GREEN which is what I wanted and ordered. Its turquoise!
"I really like the ways these shoes look....though they look a little better on the site than in person as they are not quite as dark in person.  I wore mine one time for about 3 hours and my feet were killing me.  I'm not sure why, maybe the heel is too high for me..but, also, they don't give very much...of course, they are not real leather, so that makes a difference.  Speaking of which, stores are charging too much these days for ""manmade material"" shoes.  I guess I will sell mine...they look brand new...and next time spend a little more for real leather and more comfort."
the color motif is more orange\cream than black.  design is not as pronounce as I thought it would be as people do not immediately recognize the design (carp)
Very narrow.  Always wear Reef flip flops and these did not fit at all.
This bag is smaller than expected. Leather smell is very strong. Had to air out bag . Wont carry much. Too little.
"Cute, but it shrinks!"
Thin bend easy
Ypu get what you pay for. Cheap shoes
"Excelent product, excelent construction! Dont use this in the water, with the time (2 weeks) the product broke."
"It fit very well, it's really nice looking but the bow, or whatever you make, bother you when you lay down or try to dress something above it. Whatever, I kept it"
"I like them they are comfortable, but you can not wear all day. I did and my feet started to hurt a little and I have flat feet!"
"A little bigger than I would have thought, but cute regardless."
It fit my 22 month old perfectly.
a little small but it looks very nice
I'm keeping them. I like the style but can only wear thin stockings with them
"Look...bottom line it really is very nice. Great style, great colors, but just too small. My wife is a 4/6 and is 5'7"". So she's a little more lengthy then most, but she would where a small in most cases or a medium to get the extra length. But this small was basically spandex on her. We thought about returning it and getting a large, but they were out of any/all of the next sizes up so sadly we had to just return it. But if they has the right size I would buy it again for sure."
"it broke the next day, it is low quality but it is pretty"
Maybe it's just me but I feel these run a little big.  Other than that thee are great scrub pants.
Waist line could be lower. But it is beatiful
"OK, but runs large"
A LITTLE SMALL FOR A SIZE 10 IN THE TOES AND FOOT
Very heavy backpack and the water bottle pouch ripped after only 2 weeks of use.
"Too small for my needs.  Absolutely adorable, but more suitable for ""young"" people (in my opinion).  Since it didn't fit my wallet and a lipgloss inside, I gave it to my teenaged daughter- and she loves it."
waist to small. to tight.
"This bra is comfortable and gives nice support but my boobs look so pointed!  Its a shape I have never had a problem with in any other bra.  They look fine from the front but when I turn sideways they look like a torpedo. That said, I still wear it because it is so supportive (I am a 30F) and comfortable.  If it gave me a more natural shape I'd give it 5 stars."
"After reading all the reviews, I had great hope for these shoes. I purchased size 6 although normally I wear 6.5. They fit all right.

However the bottom of the shoes do not feel like typical Skechers - feels too hard. I am disappointed."
"Only reason it does not get 5 stars - The zipper goes all the way around the hood, so it is pokes into your neck."
"The metal is thin, so it's really easy to bend them out of shape.  You have to bend them to latch them on, on the back of the ear.  So be careful."
"Very thin leather that is soft and appears to be padded with something.  Not the best, but is functional."
"Great fit, Slick look. The only issue is not much padding it has. You feel walking with cardboard sandals. Not having a shock absorbing mechanism concerns me."
"Not much metal so if your arm is large it won't look as it is displayed in the picture on you. Keep that in mind, the way it is displayed is for the arm of a pretty lean person and looks so on my teenage daughter arm which is super cute."
"Bought this in another color when the price dropped. I have a normal size 8 foot. These are extremely wide, like a D width, & long enough that if I decide to keep them, will need to ge heel sticky pads so they won't come off. Love the leather, but they make my feet look like clodhoppers."
"Ordered in tall for my 6'4"" son.  The overall fit was as expected...but not the length.  I ordered in tall.  They were not even as long as some regular lengths.  Still did the job, but don't understand how this was considered tall."
"I considered this because -
a) it had a zippered pocket
b) It had a coin pocket
c) plastic pockets for card etc which was closable.

According to product description - ""an id window and picture inserts under a cover with a snap closure, three card slots, and a fully lined, divided bill pocket with two key keepers""

However -
a) the zipper seems to be of very ordinary quality - I am afraid one day it will break
b) the snap closure is maybe ok if you have just a few cards...but if you fill it up, the snap-closure seems to get stretched. I wish the makers has made a sturdier and more flexible mechanism for the snap closure....

So I think it is expensive for what it aims to be providing..."
The design on the robe is cute but I was hoping when I read fleece that the material would be thicker.
"I bought this skirt after getting another that had a slit and wanting one without. I liked the other brand but chanced this one because of the Prime shipping. It's soft and comfortable, although it is a little big in the waist, I probably could have gone with a large and been fine. The material doesn't seem thin enough to be see through but time will tell. On the recomendation of another reviewer I bought Jockey's Slimmies shorts to go under this and the other skirt and I am happy I did, they eliminate panty lines and smooth out my backside and thighs. I am only 5' 1"" so the waist being able to be folded over makes it adjusting the length easy. I would agree with other reviewers that if you are taller this skirt may not work for you as I only had to fold the waist (waist is maybe 2-3"" worth of fabric) over once for it to sit at my ankles. All in all it is a nice skirt and while I plan on purchasing more I think I may stick with the brand I got the first time even though Prime shipping is not available."
Good material. The suit is lined and its mid calf.  A good buy for the office.
Too big than I expected but nice
Worm the shoes for a 12 hour shift. Felt good just a little narrow.
The fit was ok but too long. The material was too thick for the heat here in Miami during the summer months. Returned
Sent shoes back because they bulge at the sides when walking.  They are cute shoes but they need to made better.
This is cute but is nowhere near a newborn size. My daughter is one month old and won't be able to wear this for many months. And she is not particularly small - she was 7 pounds when she was born and is over 9 pounds now.
"This washed well in the delicate cycle.  They needed ironing, but not much - I could have wore them without.  Unfortunately, I doubt they will last with repeated use.  We have long summers here so this type of shirts see a lot of use.  I won't be buying any of these anymore, but if you are, stock up they are quite affordable."
Decent money clip; certainly halves the thickness of my regular wallet.  The card holder will hold credit cards and similar cards provided that they are EXACTLY the size of credit cards (larger cards won't go in and smaller cards will fall out).  Holder also works best when you have a few cards in the holder-- one or two are likely to fall out.
"The fit on this jacket was somewhat small. It's not tight, but I usually like my jackets looser. Otherwise a good value for money."
"The thermal crew is soft and comfortable, but does not work well as an undershirt.  It is too baggy and bunches up if you try to put clothes over it.  I was thinking in terms of thermal underwear when I bought it, but apparently it is not."
The under layer of fabric tears easily. Center part of under wire pokes out which is extremely unflattering and annoying
"I bought this watch in 07, or at least one exactly like it, from the department store. I have always worn seikos and I've either lost them or just wanted a different style. The only problems I've had is fogging up or the bracelet wears out. And let me tell you I wear the hell out of them.

This watch is one that I didn't wear often until about 2 years ago. I have been wearing it almost every day and there is not a scratch on the crystal. Today I dropped it. That's the end of the watch. I picked it up, expecting maybe a scratch, didn't see one. Then I noticed the 2 from the 12 had fallen off and was just loose inside. I was so upset. Never in all of my years of owning a seiko had any of my watches ever had this kind of problem. I used to run them through the washer on a regular basis. And now after one little fall of a few feet it's ruined. You may think ""well you can still use it"" but the 2 has gotten wedged between the face and the second hand and that has stopped the watch from working. It's happened twice today. Maybe the number falling off is a fluke, or maybe, like everything else, they just don't make them like they used to.

I will contact seiko tomorrow and find out if it can be fixed. I'm afraid it can't be because it's under the crystal. I guess I will find out. I'll update this when I get more info."
The heel is very wide and my foot slipped around.  The fit is more like a man's shoe.  I couldn't keep them.
"Looks weird. I've got little boobs. This dress mocks me. It's nice but if you're not heavily endowed it won't lay right. It's long ( I'm 5'8"") - the back part is weird on me too. I lack the rear to fill it out so it lays awkwardly across my back"
"These shoes are okay...They look good. However, the clasp is very very cheap! I was worried it might come off at some point. Ultimately returned because they are also not great for walking all day in"
"Worked for a year but when I tried to replace the battery the watch face fell out and so did the arms... not ideal since I wasn't able to get them back on. I loved this watch until I tried to replace the battery, I may stay away from this company from now on."
"OK for dress shoes, boots and sneakers need bulkier front."
"I really like the look of these sandals.  Unfortunately they are very hard to get on and off and once they are on they pull so hard that the toe post pulls on the space between your big and next toe, making them painful.  This is the second pair of Crocs that I tried that had some problem resulting in pain.  The other pair is called the Really Sexi Flip Sandal-- unlike this style which is just called Sexi.  The fact is the other pair really was the really sexi sandal, I got so many compliments on them.  But they, too, became painful after one day of wear--on the heel and made blisters.  Actually, that is why I bought this pair of only sexi flips without the really.  Because the back part around the heel isn't as tall so I didn't think it would cause problems.  And it didn't, but the toe post did.  So after these went back I bought a pair of regular Crocs flips flops (from another site) called the Really Sexi Marbled Flip.  No back to cause blisters or pull on the toe post, just flip flops  I don't know what happened to Crocs but they are not wonderful anymore.  This pair is also going back because the straps cause blisters.  Crocs used to be comfortable and reliable. I have never had blisters or pain from Crocs before and am rethinking my whole rubber shoe philosophy."
"I'm sure I saw the size when I ordered, but the wing was so small I cannot give it to her.  You cannot tell it's a wing unless you squint at it.  The chain is pretty but looks plastic.  I'll donate it at Christmas.  The workmanship was good.  I just thought it would come close to the size of my pinky in length.  I'll keep looking for a graduation gift."
"Could of begin a little  larger love the design though would of been nice if they made made it
for bigger busted women."
bigger than what I expected or wished for. Its a little larger than a quarter.
"Beautiful shoe, but where the opening starts aka where I get bunions near my little pinky toes it is PAINFUL. I'm a size 7, but I consider myself having wide feet."
Too tight up by the knee
"I bought two of these for my sister and I. It was a bit too big in appearance, not as delicate as I would like for us. I lost mine after a month, but I didn't buy it again because I felt it wasn't as pretty as expected.  Still looking for the right one"
"It finally came!!! when I open the package it was kind of sweaty/wet in some parts like it was being used but did not smell bad so Im hoping its only humidity....I try like for 15 min(first time with a ""faja"") but sadly it was too big for what I need it(good bye tummy but there was no shape I had the same waist with or without the faja and I was using the tighter hook!!! according to the size guide I was supposed to be xl but I will advise to people with 140lbs 5'4"" waist 31""=79 cm buy L or M!!! Now that I see the package it recommend M for my waist/weight combo. Better go to the website of the brand first to see what better suits you! I will buy it again but different size."
"I already have some bras that are almost like this one from Bali.  They fit well, the cup material is softer, but this was the closest thing I could find to the ones I already own.  These bras seem a bit too large in the cup but a bit small around on the bottom.  The smallness will likely improve with time as they stretch out a bit from wear.  The cup size might not improve because of the different fabric and they seem to be a bit ""shaped"" already.  I was hoping for a better fit.  I can say that my previous ones have worn well and I would expect the same from these.  I am just disappointed in the fit."
One of the shoes seems to sit/flop to the side so that the back half of my foot hangs off the side. The other shoe is fine. Not sure what they did wrong. I'm still using them. It's tolerable.
Show was very pretty but was too high of a heel
"Great shoe. However too big for me. I will order a size down. Shipping took forever, didn't realize these were coming from China."
"At first sight this wrist watch is beautiful, smooth, glamorous... I give 3 stars because the wristband seem to be easily scratchable, and the wristband lock feels very poor..."
I'm 5'8 with a long torso and weigh 165. I wear a 6/8 in clothes and the large was loose but not long enough in the torso cause it gives me a bad front wedggy. I own another one I bought at Target and that one does the same. So basically if you have a long torso your gonna have to realize these will always be uncomfortable.
These were too tight for my feet and lower legs.  I was looking for socks that would help my shoes to fit my feet better and cusion my feet.
I like the shoe but it fits a bit large all around
I wore a 74E in another brand but this shoe ran huge for me.  I decided to go with a tie up in a 6.5 4E Propet and they fit fine.
"The show is very light. The only con I have is the shoe is a little narrow across my toes. Other than that, it is stylish and lightweight."
"This was almost the jean that my husband usually wears.  When I placed the order the description was for the ""relaxed fit"", but when I got it they changed it to just the regular fit.  They even changed the description on it.  This is the first time I've had any trouble with something like this from Amazon.  He needed jeans and since it's hard to find his size we kept them.  They're an okay jean except I'm not happy with Amazon and I do quite a bit of ordering from them."
"I have another pair of these same type slippers.  Wasn't expecting them to be so narrow, other than that, they are fine!"
"Cheap, thought the name brand would make them a little better but they are just cheap knit gloves with a logo sewn on.  Already has a few small holes after 2 months.  Get what you pay for, I use them to smoke in."
"I think this costume is so cute, however for a newborn size, it is HUGE. It should be labeled 2T-3T."
"These glasses are GORGEOUS.  They are also horribly uncomfortable.  I feel like I have a pretty average-sized skull, but the arms don't rest comfortably on the side of my head.  The bottom of the lenses make contact with my face so when I take the glasses off, I look like Inigo Montoya!!!  But the worst part is my hair gets caught on the back of the arms if I take them off or try to pivot them to rest on top of my head.

I wanted to like these sunglasses so much but they just won't allow me to do so!"
Color darker and not as bright as expected. Good quality.
"The material of the shirt is very nice.  Super soft and nice color.  The style is great, except the sleeves fit VERY tight around your arms!  I even read the reviews before ordering, and ordered a size larger than I normally wear for this very reason.  I ended up with a baggy blouse with arm sleeves that make my arms look like sausages.  Bummer."
"So I ordered the Hot Pink and this Mint color at the same time.  Both were delivered but the tags looked different.  The hot pink color fit perfect and material was very soft and went well with my leggings.  The mint fit more like a small and the material was not soft at all.  Had to return it.  Really want this color, but not sure if I would get the same material if I re-order."
The fuzzy coller is ugly.  I'm trying to figure out what I can do to cover that ugliness Any ideas?
"The top portion of the boot is MUCH wider than I expected, with no real way to tighten them without it looking weird and lumpy. I am not sure what I will do to fix them for my costume."
Not what I expected. Very loose and won't stay up.
Fits too tight over a diaper.
"I've bought two pairs of these one was my regular size and the other was half a size down the half size was a little to tight but it'll stretch so meh. My grey ones came in really poor quality one of the crochet flowers was ripped....but my ""natural"" one came in with very high quality material? Which is weird. So yeah beware of what you'll get, and hope for the best."
"I like these, but the clip to allow you to make it racerback hurts.  I have other brands and don't have this problem, but other than that, the quality is good and so are the pads."
Is beautiful boot a little uncomfortable
"The pants are great, but they smelled AWFUL when we opened the package. Like dead and rotting fish. We had to wash them twice to get rid of the disgusting smell."
"The turquoise color only appears when the earrings are in sunlight.  Otherwise, the color looks closer to navy blue.  I still like them and wear them."
"Bottom button fell off immediately. Despite that, husband likes it, keeps him warm."
"I'm 5'8"" and these pants are too short. They'll stay in the closet until summer and I can wear them with sandals"
"I am 5' 7"" at 130 lbs. 28"" waist with a slight muscular build. The shirt fits perfect in the shoulder and chest. The waist is a little big. The sleeves are way long. The shirt looks good but wrinkles very quickly."
"I absolutely love the design of this ring! But why did it only get three stars?  Well because the size is just slightly off and I cannot wear it on any finger!  This really bums me out!  Out of all the rings I own, this one is now my favorite by design and I cannot wear it!  I ordered it in a larger size to fit my middle finger, and yet it does not, nor does it fit any other finger.  And it slides right off my thumb."
"Material is nice and smooth, feels good on. However, had to return it because the cup size is way big. I would order a cup size smaller than my normal size if ordering it again. Came shipped all scrunched up so the cups were no longer smooth.  Amazon problem it seems, not the bra's fault."
Great all around but lacing in support. The soles are rather floppy and comparable to All-Stars. Almost like walking barefoot.
Disappointed because I liked the  style  but the quality of the material is cheap....so it looks cheap
"This is a beautiful, classy shoe for evening wear, but a little too stiff for all day at work.  Not nearly as comfortable as the Ros Hommerson Women's Cabernet Pump.  I felt it ran too narrow for a medium width."
"I guess this review depends on what you're looking for. From the description, I didn't expect this skirt to be how it was and sent it back.  This would make an excellent polyester slip for a long clingy skirt. I cannot imagine wearing it as anything but a slip.  The fabric  is not a soft or brushed polyester or rayon feel like many maxi skirts are but a simple, straight, wrinkle free, grandmother's gabardine slippery  tight smooth polyester.  If you are wanting just a casual workhorse skirt, and like me hoping for an around the house skirt in winter, this is not it. It is 1) very thin and slippery, 2) I didn't check but considering just how thin and clammy it is, I ordered a camel color , and either my underwear lines, extra bulges or stuff would most likely be showing thru.

I love their a line stretch denim panel skirt. You could wear it every day. I wish they made that in a shorter version for summer. I think I would wear just those year round if that was the case."
These aren't great for jogging.
Colors are not as vibrant and material is thinner than expected.
To big for my son..
"Super cute but if worn for an extended time, back of foot will start to chafe."
"To date, I have purchased two of these bras. I like the way they support and they make the girls look GREAT...however, the under-wire breaks through and starts poking me so quickly I can't see myself purchasing any more again. I've worn other bras for far longer than I wore these without having any under-wire breakthrough...and that makes me sad amazon readers...Without the under-wire issue - I would have given this a five star review...but after dealing with this two separate times with two separate bras (with a bra in between to see if maybe I'm just really hard on bras) it turns out that the fabric that holds the under-wire in is too thin or the under-wire is too sharp. *sigh* What can I say? I really wanted this to be my go-to bra...but my chest cannot take anymore poking!"
"As other reviewers have noted, this lightweight serum has a thick consistency and orange, shimmery appearance. I don't notice any shimmer or ""glow"" on my fair skin after application, and the orangesicle fragrance fades quickly. I allow the serum to soak in for 30-60 seconds before applying moisturizer and sunscreen (La Mer and Shiseido, respectively). At night, it goes after my toner (Algenist) and under my moisturizer.

After using about half the bottle (1-2 pumps per use), I haven't noticed any effect at all. The serums I've used in the past either add a little moisture, make the skin smoother, or give a little brightening and evenness to skin tone (or all three). This one does... exactly nothing. I can't even tell when I forget to apply it before my moisturizer. Maybe long-term benefits would include some of the nebulous claims of ""healthy, younger looking skin with renewed vitality,"" but there's really no motivation to keep using it.

I also agree with another reviewer that the ingredients list should be prominently displayed on the product page, and that the purported benefits of the many, many ingredients made clear. Not only could those with sensitivities steer clear, but we'd be more educated about what we're applying to our skin and what combination of products would work best for us. I'll update this review if I notice any benefits after longer use, but I can't recommend it at this point."
This is fairly small. I wear an 8 and I am hoping I will be able to wear this little sweater.
I LOVE this romper. It's so comfortable!
"Husband hasn't decided if he likes these or not. The quality is good, but they tend to crawl up."
Material a bit lightweight which is fine for here down south. If you plan on wearing it outside of house it would require ironing. A little overpriced for what you get. I do like the cut and curved hem.
"Shiny and awesome. It has some give for wide wrists. It would have 5 stars, here. It's a gorgeous item, but the quality is questionable. I dropped stars since the adhesive that was used for the gems is terrible. Gems are falling out."
Too small. Sizing is definitely off. Go up at least a half size.
"little big for me, but it's still ok."
"These shirts were not as good of quality as I purchase in the store.  They are much thinner and cut smaller.  I will purchase in store. I expect Hanes to be of the same quality wherever they come from, but that is not the case."
"Fits well and nice construction, but there is a little lip across the top that shows under fabric. I had to move the bra farther down on my ribs to minimize this."
"Used once for a long outdoor winter activity,  and not as warm as had hoped for lightweight thin socks."
Purchased for a project to make pew dolls. Not suitable to blow your nose in! Too thin. The embroidery was pretty though. Price was good.
The top and jacket fit perfectly but the skirt was a TENT! I had to cut it and modify it to fit me.
It broke after a couple months
They sent me the wrong size or else it would have fit just fine . I ordered M they sent a small . So disappointed . Good quality though . I will definitely buy again.
Leather quality seems cheap. Otherwise they're okay
"Great price for a lounging bra. Doesn't have the greatest shape, but it fits extremely well and it is very comfortable."
Pretty decent for the money... not much on support but you can glue the soles from an old shoes to the bottoms to give you some protection against water and rocks and make walking easier if you are tender footed!
"Normally my husband take a size 8 in all sketchers, but these were a little tight.  Unfortunately they went back.  But they are a good looking sneaker."
It's nice for kids or teens. The chain looks cheep but the heart is very beauty full.
had to step outside to make sure it was really warm enough. It seems to be fine for an upcoming trip to a colder climate.
its a bit tight at the entrance part but manageable.
"Had to re-lace it, but it fit okay. Wish it were a little longer though."
This tag is worth the money I paid for it but isn't anything special. I had to use zip ties to attached it to my suitcase because the strap that came with it was too small.
"I absolutely love Franco Sarto! Shoes are very comfortable, these are no exception. I have a very near a heel and the band on the back although adjustable does not accommodate a cool completely. So, the shoe does slip off. I needed to modify it. Very comfortable fat per usual"
"This shoe is really made to half-sizes in length. Ex., I ordered a 6, expecting European size 36. Instead it's 37 cm in length. For all those who find whole-size-only shoes a problem, this is your walking sandal! For me, not a fit. Too long, which means I keep tripping on stairs and steps."
"Good glasses but smaller then I anticipated for my big head, I think I ordered the wrong pair in error. My mistake but not worth returning they will still do for yard work etc."
The shoes were on the large size
"Fast delivery, good price, and different  than the norm shoes! Order a size bigger just to be safe, trust me they run small. And if your child has wide feet, pass on these. The picture does not do they glitter justice.. these shoes are covered in glitter and it is very...wow .. in person. I ordered these for my daughter as school shoes to go with her uniform and I actually think the glitter makes them stand out a Lil too of much and also makes it hard to find clothes that go with them...good quality though."
"Good comfortable cheap house shoes.  Makes you kind of shuffle like an old lady, but guess that's what I am -- ha."
"I just tried these for the first time. The outdoor air temperature was 30 degrees. I inserted a Hot
hands pocket in each heat pocket. After about 25 minuets my fingers were cold. After 45 minutes they were becoming numb. I was active (shoveling snow).

Conclusion: These are not very effective for warmth."
"This set looks nice and for the price is okay but be careful, the bracelet can (and probably will) snag everything it comes in contact with! It seems like the two ends that make the rope weren't finished off properly(they're rough). I don't know if I got a bad bracelet or if they're all like that. Nonetheless, it's a cute set."
"Much too small.  Order one or two sizes up for a good fit, especially if you have a large bust."
These are cut very small and you need to order 2 sizes extra larger because they shrink if you put them in the dryer. The elastic also will not hold up in the dryer so these should be hung up to dry.
"Stiffer and not as fine of material as my original boots -- exactly the same maker, size and color -- that I purchased several years ago.  They also ran small this time.  However, I like enough to keep them."
purchase for a friend
"sizing is not accurate, buy a size bigger.  Not for narrow feet, unless you have a good shoe maker that can adjust them.  Cute to knock around in"
I wanted some cheap warm cotton gloves to wear when I go running. These work. They a little tighter fitting than I would prefer.
Does not stay in place or push up like picture shows. I can see how it could be used as a strapless bra but it didn't feel very secure. I would spend more money and get better quality.
"I ordered a small (I am usually a medium 5'6"" 140lbs). It was HUGE!!!  Pretty print-true to picture."
"Columbia did a great job designing this boot for the most part. The boots keep me very warm and do an excellent job being waterproof. The bottom eyelets are made from a small amount of leather. Poor design in my opinion. Both boots had bottom eyelets break within the first month of use in the snow. Working at a ski resort, I really need something I can count on. These boots, however, left something to be desired in regards to design."
I have had to stretch mine because they were too tight on the top of my foot. I am needing to stretch the left again. The support and fit feels good though! Once I get the top fitting me I think I will love them!
"Fit as expected. It is very spandexy, and not really shear but shows every flaw (cellulite, panty lines, etc).  Pretty cool design though, and looks pretty good with Spanx. I wore it for a dance performance, and with 20 of us wearing it, we made quite a statement!"
"I had bought the black/gray versions of these pants, and because of how much I liked them, I bought these.  I had to return them.  If you are on the  end of the sizing for this, you will likely not have enough, if any, string left (I had about 2-3 inches give in the pants, but the strings weren't even touching let alone long enough to tie together).  They are well made, though."
i bought half size up and still too small and narrow. but appeared to be of great quality. however i sent them back!!
Post is extremely long and had to be trimmed. Almost a quarter inch longer than normal earrings.
Draw string broke first day I wore them.
It is nice but very wide
b-
"I like the memory foam, but had to purchase inserts for arch support. Attractive design. I purchased these in hopes of using them to work. I'm a nurse and on my feet for 12+ hours pr shift. Unfortunately they are not supportive enough for me. I will use them as a casual sneaker instead."
"I think I bought a size too big, except it fits well in the lower legs.  The lower stomach area has A LOT of extra material. Not even in the area where the baby is, below that. Maybe because it's a larger size?  It's almost like they expect your stomach to start in your upper thighs.  I wear longer shirts so it hides it anyway but still. Kinda janky."
"Shipping came quick and the wig/beard is what was expected for the low price that I paid.  Just heads up, bandana is not included. The wig is fairly thin so you do have to wear a bandana or a hat to give the illusion that it's thick. Also strings on hair kept falling out and all over the place. Had my son only use the wig (cuz the beard was a mess) for 100th day of school."
Used three times.  Magnets came off.  I will have to find a stronger glue to hold it onto the item or return it.
"Too small, runs 1 size less."
"The hat is fine but the color is quite a bit darker than the picture shows.  I would call ""medium brown"" rather than pecan.  Replaced it with the putty gray which looks very close to the picture.

The felt is very soft and comfortable.  Hope it lasts as long as my previous hat."
"Not what I see in the picture, so I bought a silver one and it looks like the picture. Not sure about the mess up with the gold one. Pretty anyway."
"Love the fit..i have gotten two of these dresses in black/white and oatmeal/beige.form fitting, a bit see through and easy to just throw on. But my 2nd dress had a hole on the side. But will probably buy one more in the pink."
Cheap zipper and too big. It's going back.
Cute sweater but much shorter than expected. Will be returning.
Lengthwise - it could have been a bit longer to reach the ankles as right now it's above the ankles
"This is the first time I've purchased a front close bra and I have to say it will be the last. There are more hooks than you actually need and the top ones come unhooked with normal movement (embarrassing). I feel that if there were just two less, this wouldn't be a problem and fit and support would be just as good.  The shoulder straps are nice; comfortable and do their job without constant adjusting and it washes up quite nice. Overall, I think sticking with a back hook, if you can help it, would be better."
"I had to adjust the waste because of my skinny tall 9 year old. I had to adjust it by 2 inches, but the length was perfect."
"bleh. very, very thin fabric. better wear a camisole beneath it."
"Socks are stocking stuffers for my kids.  I got the ""Meat"", ""Bacon"" and ""Beer"" socks.  All are cute and well made."
"I wanted a looser fit, which is why I went up two sizes from what I usually wear."
Not all that comfortable maybe after a few washing it  it get better
giving it away
Material is very thin.  I wouldn't wear this unless I wear something over my rump as you can definitely see through them.
This was ok.  Not fabulous.  Slightly helpful but not really compressable.  They're sturdier than the plastic compression bags but not as effective.  Just ok.
"The size fits fine but my toes stick up out of the top. The shoe is just very ""short"" and is an odd fit. I'm not entirely happy with them but that's what you get buying shoes online."
needed to order larger size.
"Not bad for a $20 dress, like the color"
"We got this for a school play. It worked for what we needed, but it would have not made it much longer than an hour or two. Cheaply made."
"this looks nothing like the picture  fits nothing like the picture and I'm very sorry about that because  I like the design  of it so if your no 5ft  very skinny it won't fit  it says fits xs to m  but I would dsy xs only ,,it is 33.5 x 20.5
it will just look like one of those little shrug  valero's  my granddaughter said it looked dumb on me ..
I got this on a promo at  $13.12  I probably won't  do anymore clothes on promo at this price  or anywhere near it
I received this at a small discount for my honest review ............"
They would not stay in my hair.
"More like a 1X. Straight up and down, no A line to accommodate hips. I washed and then stretched them out while wet and hung to dry. They fit my 2X bottom half. Would not buy again though. They need to get their sizes right."
"I wore this shoe for the first time, people can hear me coming because the shoes flops a lot, which I don't like, it's good they have the thong in the center which helps keep the shoe on. They are true to size and I found them comfortable."
ordered for my MOH and didn't fit..
It is narrower than other similar jackets of the same size.
"The material is good for the purpose but it arrived folded and can't be ""unfolded"" and it's too small. It seems like it is made for a young teenage child."
Where smaller then expected. But cool bags.
Love the color and everything but they seemed a little short for working out in.
"This is a cute and sexy bra, however, it fits a bit snug with some spillage. It is also not comfortable and hurts my shoulders because of the ""no give"" straps. I am a size 40L and nursing at the moment. Beautiful color and lace though. I was originally going to convert this bra into a nursing bra...but because of the fit I will not be."
"They look great, they fit great. The side pockets are a bit too shallow and are not tacked down (as they are in some of my other shorts) so they tend to come out in the surf. The mesh underwear inside are a bit coarser than my Patagonia shorts.

I bought the Barracuda trunks as well and they have the same issues."
They run a little small.
"They're good for a cheap shoe, they seem to have wore fast."
"You can get pants similar to these at Ross for $15. I actually purchased Victorious pants at Ross for $19 and they were a thicker material, closer to Levis. They're on the thinner side, stretchable. I went with a 32x30 but should have gotten 30x30 so they would have been tighter."
"durable, not comfortable, i washed these 20x times before wearing them.  great for certain lines of work, but generally just too stiff and awkward."
I have bought two others and they were a little more durable. But good if your not going to use them every day.
"I bought this in July 2014 and have worn it every day since then. It has since worn down around where I tighten the belt and I can already see some flaking off of the exterior. I have a 28"" waist and this does the job but I can't say the build quality is up to par."
i love the size of the heel but i have skinny legs and the calf is much too wide for them. i can only wear them over denims or under skirt that covers the calf.
"Fit's nice, big V neck."
"I wear an 11W & have moderately flat feet. These shoes offer virtually no arch support & I can feel it within an hour of putting them on. At first they are comfortable, and I will say there is no toe pinching, heel cutting or any of that going on. My feet begin to feel fatigued too quickly, though, and that's just walking on carpet, not even doing any physical activity like vacuuming or something like that. Flats aren't the best for flat feet, I know, but my knees can no longer take high heels. Even low heels can throw my knees & back out of whack if they're not well-built, so I thought I'd try these as an occasional alternative, when I need dressier shoes than my normal Saucony or New Balance running shoes (which is best for daily wear in terms of keeping my feet, knees & back happy over the long haul) in the fall & winter. (SoftSpots Tela sandals are my spring/summer pick for comfortable yet inexpensive sandals that I can wear all day & night.) For women w/ normal or high arches, these might be perfectly fine.

I bought these in black & they look nice enough- a simple pair of shoes that can be dressed up or down, they look nice w/ hosiery. If one is simply looking for an inexpensive pair of flats that'll only be used occasionally & won't be used for a lot of walking or other physical activity, they're okay. If one is wearing these daily, I would question that, because these are not shoes built to really support the feet over a long-term basis. Ultimately, I have learned that I typically get what I pay for, and I will try on a more expensive, but better-built, fal/winter dress shoe next time."
"Way big! I had to cut and alter it. Other than that, it's lovely."
"I am giving 3 stars because it runs very small. I usually comfortably wear a medium tshirt, but based on other reviews, I ordered up to a large. It fit right, so I wished I'd gotten an XL. These are junior sizes, not women's. Shirt was a good quality and very cute."
"These are no were as nice as Carhart pants, but not bad for the price. One thing I don't like is the pockets, they are small. So small I can hardly get my hands into them."
They are ok but I'd save them for cooler weather. They are a bit thick and they were too big on our size 5 and 6 feet. They'd be perfect for cooler weather though but not warmer.
"Too bad. Beautiful shoes... probably comfortable too, just not on my feet. I wear an 8 1/2 c/d. Nike just tends to run too narrow for me so it looks like I'll be sticking with asics."
Won't buy it again
"They didn't fit me right, so I had to return, can't really give a rating."
The hook is a little small to hook on to the luggage handle.  the numbers are a little hard to read.
Not as comfortable as they should be for being a LifeStride shoe.
"Cute suit but sizing is an issue. If you order this size up at least two sizes. I would return it, but it just isn't worth the effort."
Not very comfortable but very stylish.
I was wary because reviews said it ran a little smaller. I got a medium anyway and it fit just as everything else does. There is a thread by the zipper coming undone and I'm not too big of a fan of the material. I recommend washing with fabric softner. And this is definitely a winter only sweater. Otherwise I like it and wear it all the time.
Great pants but the fit was off.  I had to return these And get a size bigger in the waist.
I don't see any significant difference in the level of chemical smell after I installed the charcoals.  Maybe they are somehow useful.
I normally wear a size 7 which seem to be too short in the front.  The 7.5 are too big.  Wish I could find a pair that fit exactly because they certainly are very comfortable when I wore them around the house.
"I was expecting them to be opaque, and they are not. :-("
Thinner than expected. Fabric shredded in the shoulders from regular wear.
"They were wide enough, but they are made out of oddly stiff material, and the edges of the shoe rubbed my feet all raw. So, they were not as comfortable as I would have hoped."
"Definitely needed a breaking-in period, but now is fine.  Last pair of these I owned were so comfortable I wanted a new pair when they wore out.  Unfortunately, it appears it is a near certainty the soles with crack (and then water can get it) after about 1 year of daily wear."
Very large. Doesn't fit my fiances wrist at all. Works well. Just WAY TOO BIG
"This dress is great for the price ($10), but I ended up sending it back. It is unlined (as should be expected at the price) and unforgiving; if you are a young woman with very flat abs this will look great on you!"
This runs small. Can wear it now but maybe later. It is cute but really looks like a gown instead of a coverup.
This product is way smaller than the picture detail is hard to see.
The size 9 (my usual size) is too small so they are in the box ready to be dropped off for a return.
These were too big so I had to send them back.
I gave it as a gift to my younger sister.
"It's cute, the straps are a little cheap.  & the dress is a little large around the mid-section.  Fabric around the zipper in the back can bunch up and make you look boxy.  But not bad for halloween.  I wouldn't wear it out again for new years or anything but it's a good costume."
I'll take a little long = (
Beautiful shoes but run a little small compared to most.  They wear out pretty fast too. We only got a few months wear out of these shoes.
Purchased this dress in army print and red. The army print was noticeably shorter than the red. If you are over 5'8 you might want to rethink purchasing the army print.
Not a great look
"This necklace is nice and it seems to be real gold but the packaging was a bit sketchy.  It came in a knot.  The knot came out but still, it didn't look good to my girlfriend I gave it to."
"The outfit IS cute. Don't get me wrong. the 3-6 sizing is very inaccurate. this is more like 12-15 months at least. Also, the decal on the hat and the decal on the belly shipped stuck together and when I pulled them apart, it definitely damaged the decal on the belly which is disappointing. Other then that, the fabric is nice enough, the outfit really is pretty cute and... in a year or so my baby will look pretty cute wearing this and at least I won't get upset if he stains it since it's already damaged."
Just wish it had a few more internal pockets and the handles were a few inches longer
"Jesus Christ !  The height and width of this pant is ok , but the with of the legs... my god !  It make me seems a really fat guy in the legs !  And by the way the ""blue navy"" is a little bit shinny and thant's no the photo. Buy something more expensive if you find !"
"Fun shirt, but tough sizes. Large was too tight so returned for xlarge and felt like the same shirt"
Not what I expected but its OK. It's cotton but not erected just simple plain.
"I really wanted to love these.  They fit just as expected.  The material caught me off guard, as it is sort of spandex-y.  I feel like these are something a dancer would wear.  If not for that, I may have actually kept them.  I couldn't fight the urge to put on a puffy-sleeved shirt and grab a tambourine.  These pants felt more like performing pants than everyday pants.  I just can't get past the fabric. Ugh."
Haven't worn it cos I think it's too short for my torso. The length looks different in the picture.
I like the bracelet. But is sooo hard to remove.
I found that the anchor gets hung up on the infinity piece and it gets stuck.  It doesn't stay as pictured when worn all day.  The anchor always ends up inside the infinity piece. This necklace is long.  It falls between my cleavage.
"Great looking, but were ultimately too big. Felt almost a full size bigger than Under Armour and Nike the same size."
"Love the print, but sizing is way off. My 7 year old is normally a 7/8. Based on reviews I purchased a 10 and it's too small. Tight at armpits & shoulders. Returning for a larger size. Too bad it's so difficult to estimate the correct sizing."
It is ok. But it doesn't have enough cushion for standing long time.
Beautiful very good
"I wore this watch for about two months before the band rotted away. I am used to replacing Timex bands every nine months or so (I tend to wear my watches 24/7 - and they show it) but I was surprised that the glue and stitching came undone so easily. In fact some of the finish rubbed off after about three weeks. I was doing some last minute hardware supply/craft store runs before my sister's wedding and it broke off of my wrist into the grass somewhere as I carried shopping bags over to my car. I never did find the watch!

I really like the pearl luminescence of the face and the band (while the finish lasted) was very beautiful. Had I not lost the watch I would have just replaced the band every few months like I normally do. The watch itself was the utilitarian quality you expect from Timex and the gold and silver finish on the metal of the face was very durable while I had it."
"The Cross was beautiful and well priced, but the points on the cross were too pointed and sharp. The wearer had to eventually stop wearing it.
Sorry!!"
"Wearing this automatically makes you look like a military wannabe. It even has a SEAL Trident on the back of the case to leave on your nightstand for the girl you picked up at the bar last night to notice.

It was recommended to me as a durable, decent dive watch for a good price. And it is. But it's mostly show with a little go.

Not very bright, and has cheap band and spring type pins - it will break under extreme conditions. My bezel popped off on a piece of coral. The last thing you need is a band to break while diving. And on an otherwise average dive watch, the band and pins make it actually risky to rely on.

The plastic armature and band are tough.
The crystal will scratch and break.
The bezel comes off on rocks and coral.
It has a phony ""SEAL"" reputation (They don't use these - I've never met a SEAL who had one.)
It's lightweight.
It goes to 200 meters - very good for an inexpensive watch.
Visibility is good but basically average - tritium is much brighter and lasts longer.
The band is very cheap rubber, too thick, and held on with spring pins - not screw in pins, which are more durable.

This is a watch for poseurs and people who read men's magazines. I gave mine to my neighbor - a braggart who drinks beer all day. He loves the thing.

Buy an ArmourLite Phantom. For another $150 you'll get a real watch. This one is average at best."
"even though these are really cute boots, they just didn't fit right. The arch support felt like it was on the ball of my foot, and they were too tight across the top. As well, the toe kind of sits above the heel, so the fit is just really weird. I really like the way they look, but my feet just didn't like them. I own a lot of Clarks, so it's not the brand, it's just the way this particular style fits my particular feet. I'm so glad that returns are free and easy!"
"These arrived quickly and in new packaging with tags still on.  Color is as pictured.  Definitely fluffy, I thought the footbed would be thicker but it's comfy for sure.  The piece that goes between the toes on the left had rough stitching that kept rubbing my skin.  I used a course nail file and scissors to cut it down a bit and it's a lot better now.  Pretty good overall for low price."
a little small and the legs are very short
"For $7 it has a lot of tools, I was able to adjust 3 watch bands and the Watchband pin remover worked but it doesn't stay straight and wobbles a bit, there are other tools in case it breaks but it works and saved me $40 at a watch repair shop.  Note: It takes take a gentle hand and patience.  I wouldn't recommend doing it on an expensive watch.  I would spend the money at a jeweler for a watch over $100."
"Started falling apart pretty quick. Looks great, poor quality."
Snug compared to the other color I purchased.
"Really pretty, but definitely for a child or a head scarf only. Wish I could give more stars, but was disappointed in how tiny it was. I did give it to my daughter to wear during Sabbath tho, and she really likes it."
i was too small for me made my bum look really flat...and i think if it came with a zipper it would be better than trying to get it over your head as a bodycon dress!!...it is a very lovely dress however and is good quality as well
good for the price/
"way too small, but the vendor took them back no problem."
Ordered a small for my 8 y/o and he already has to use the last hole - and he is not large for his size at all.
Its a little thin i would like it to be heavier
"It's a bit brighter on here, actually a slight dark red. But good product."
I love the design but I noticed the stitching isn't that strong.  The hoodie can tear a little easier than average hoodies. This is in comparison to Gildan brand hoodies. It is comfortable.
"Disappointed that fabric pils.  I bought a size too large but fabric is comfortable, but I don't like fabric that pils.  Had I known I would not have purchased."
The skirt is very short. Like nsfw short.
"I was excited to receive this blazer.  It was a quality jacket, however the pictures are deceiving.  This jacket would have looked AWESOME if it had been the same length all the way around.  Unfortunately, the back of the jacket is considerably longer than the sides and the back.  It looked kind of like those old tuxedo ""tails"" that guys wore back in the 80s.  This took the jacket from looking classically stylish to looking trendy and tacky.  I was so disappointed. I would have given it just 1 or 2 stars.  The 3 start rating is actually for the quality of the fabric, and how easily the jacket was returned."
"Not much to say about a pair of socks, other than they are well made and well.........just plain socks! They do seem too run a bit small."
I  like the watch. what I didn't like is the size is to big and not adjustable . so I haven't been able to were it. guess I have to take it to a store to see if they can adjust the size.
I have to order a size up as these do not come in half sizes.  And so these are too big and my foot slides around and my small toe keeps getting hooked into the twisted section at the top toe area.  If my foot could stay into the shoes due to proper fit I  might not have this happen as much but I think most people would have a problem if they are a half size and have to get the next size up.  I have kept them in hopes of wearing them with tights as I don't see how I could wear them without foot covering otherwise.
"Not sure why so many rave reviews.  It is ok, but does not provide the support of other Warner's products."
Kind of cheap. The edges are unfinished. The fabric is thin but soft should be cool in the summer.  It is cute
"I really like the color of the Old Pewter Western Boot. However, this boot runs small. So size up. This boot was death on my pinky toes and I could not wait to get home to take them off. The tips of my toes actually felt slightly numb after I removed the boots. They're cute and fashionable but not very much fun to wear. Thank God I have the sweetest boyfriend who gives me the occasional foot massage. Trust me, you're going to need a nice spa foot soak after wearing these badboys. I love Lucky Brand jeans, shirts, jewelry and bags but the shoes...not so much."
"Good shipping, but is too close to a 14g. I could barely tell the difference, so I skipped to a 14g and didn't even use the 16g. It didn't hurt at all considering I used stretching balm, vitamin E oil, and ear care, but I just shouldn't even have bought this. When stretching your ears, NEVER skip a size no matter what someone else says, I recommend if you are stretching your ears, go from a 20g or 18g (normal piercing sizes) to a 16g before a 14g, but I personally didn't think it was necessary as I had different products to help my ears stretch, keep my ears from getting infected, and to help with any slight pain or discomfort, and there really wasn't much of a difference."
"They are cute and a great price, but don't fit as expected and not very comfortable.  I bought them for running, but instead am going to use them for  everyday errands such as the grocery, etc."
Arrived in good time; the width was a little tight and the length was too long. Just didn't fit as expected so returned.
"Ordered based in the America sizes and of course it arrived and is way to big to wear. It's a nice outfit, looks well made and would have been perfect for my Halloween costume, to bad it didn't fit correctly."
"They were stretchy which was not stated in the product description.  It says ""Straight (Regular) Fit"". I would not have expected men's jeans to be stretchy"
The shoes are a little tight on my 5th toes and they became dingy looking after just a few short shifts.  I'm a little disappointed for the money.
These slippers were very cute but offered no support and after a few wearings did not stay up on the back of my foot.
"Nice shoe, not very comfortable."
Too small for me. Wish I had a larger option
stem is hard to tell where day or time setting are located.
"Pretty bracelet, but magnet is not strong at all.  It's just a matter of time before I lose this bracelet.  The clasp is quite small, and inside the clasp is a very tiny magnet, which might work for a necklace, but is not the right size or strength for a bracelet.  Stones are nicely cut and they do sparkle, but the bracelet will be gone soon so I'm not going to get too attached to it.  It's just a matter of time..."
I usually take a size 9 or 9.5. I ordered a size 10. I can wear them but a 10.5 would of not felt so tight . My big toe touches the top so wearing them for any length of time would not be comfortable.
"again, a pretty dress that doesn't quite fit true to size. the medium is a little snug"
okay for price. basic.
"There are a couple of strengths for Banyans.  This one has brownish lenses and are very light on polarization and brightness reduction.  You could wear these in a dark club or at night to look cool, but not at the beach.

The seller won't take any returns whatsoever once the seal on the box is broken, so you need to make sure you have the serial number exactly right."
Good boot when you get the right size but they run 1/2 size smaller than most New Balance
"These shoes were exactly what the description said, but when they came in the mail I didn't like them.
Ended up returning the product."
Looks good but a little snug. He kept it anyway.
"I don't mind wearing costume or fashion jewelry that's well made or made to look like the real thing, so I was eager to receive this 'tanzanite' band. Unfortunately, this ring looks like costume jewelry. Haven't found an occasion to wear it yet and will probably find a young girl to pass it on to. Wouldn't buy it again, in any of the colors."
"Pretty, but too too large."
"My daughter likes them, not me. Seem cheaply made and difficult to go through loops."
"3 stars for quality. It seemed very well made and I love the thumb holes. However, the fit was a bit odd on me. The neck was quite wide as was the hem, while the body fit well. It just seemed a bit too odds and ends so I sent it back. Still on the lookout for the perfect fleece!"
"The ankle ballet straps are far too long and don't help in keeping the shoe onto my foot at all. Unless you have some seriously swollen ankles, these shoes may fall off of your feet -- it just didn't make sense that they were made so long because the straps are made from elastic, so they would have given to stretching as they were helping to stay on the foot. Instead they just slipped around"
its a bit tight in the back but i expect that that may stretch so hopefully it will be ok
not the best arch support and i had to stretch of the back of the back it was scrapping my heal.
The top is cute and soft enough. I figured it was from China so I ordered a 1X knowing I wear a size 12. It is snug and formfitting  closer to a size 8. I'm a loyal Amazon customer but I wish Amazon would make us more aware of the clothiers from China.  it's becoming harder and harder to recognize them with their American sounding names. Their stuff is just cut too small.
"I ordered this in s/m and it was tight. I had previously ordered one like it that has sleeves in a s/m and it was huge. There seems to be no clear sizing. Typically, I wear a M. That said, the dresses are nice if you can get one that fits."
It isn't as roomy as it appeared in. Certainly can't put phone in it if there is change in change purse. But for the very cheap price it works just fine. Color is true to photo
"They shrink. So get a size or two bigger. Medium weight cotton shirt. I bought it for work as a throw away. So, I don't expect it to last more than a few months."
It had bubbles in the copper part.
I returned these.  Comfort is average but style is old lady clunky
"Bought to just slip-on when cold, but it's a bit on the small size!! Must be made in a foreign country to their standards."
Doesn't work on many types of athletic shoes.
I like this shirt but I will have to adjust it a little bit and make it more my size ( 5.4 and 114 pounds) it fits very large
"First let me say I LOVE THE VIONIC SHOES!!! These shoes are saving my steps, so to speak.  Really this is a great shoe company.  Now for these shoes, they fit great but look to manly for my taste.  I did see some similar but a little more girly at Belk's that I am going to try on as soon as I get my credit for this return.  Trying to return this item has been more of a pain from any purchase I have ever made from Amazon."
THE LEATHER IS DRY
Cute... a little smaller than anticipated....
"Nice looking boot...good airflow... so so on the ankle support (gotta really tighten those laces).  I wear a size 12 and own many New Balance shoes...these boots are a bit big.  With that said, the ""cushion"" in the sole bed is crap...okay, maybe lightly better than crap but not very good. In fact, it almost seems like they made the boot a bit larger so you have room for a better cushion.  Added a Dr. Scholls  gel insole and they now fit great!  Before I added the insoles, the boot was causing major rubbing on my outer toes due to the lack of cushion/support in that area.  Overall, a decent boot....but lacking.  **I should mention that mine do carry the NB label, but like pretty much everything...Made in Ding Dong China...or some  factory where they pay less than minimum wage."
plastic and cheap
"Soft sock, just goes higher up my calf than expected."
Sleeves too short. Stiff material after several washings.
Seent these back. They fit in the toe box but the heel was stiff once you got them on and cut the Achilles area.
Nice and sleek gloves. Very stylish. Only issue is you have to hold your finger at a certain angle to get them to work. Irritating.
I wanted it to look like the model (of course) I wear size medium and even sometimes large. I know Asian sizes run small but the large I got was huuuuuge! I wear it as a pj and it comes almost to my knees.
"Looks cute, but this design doesn't work on my body shape. Due to the dark lines down the sides, it makes me look like a stick. This may look great on curvy women, but not for someone who lacks curves like me. Returned."
"It is a nice looking mask, but I can see a little hot glue on it and the eye holes are not very big. My eyelashes touch it, and I am not sure how long I will be able to wear it at the party."
"Don't know how to say... a bit too small on the chest, but a bit too big elsewhere. Looks nice but cheaply made. Fake pockets. The button's hole is not opened wide enough for the button. It's only a thin clothes which is made like a jacket."
"It's a beautiful and well made product. Unfortunately the footmuff is way too short for my 9 month old. I got size 9-12m and the jacket is still too big on her but when I attached the lower part, I couldn't sit her in the stroller - her legs had to be bent due to no room. Very disappointed :("
"I had to return this jacket because the sizing is completely off. While the cut is very flattering, the sleeve sizing and wait measurement is not as described. I wear  a size 10 and a 14 in this jacket could barely fit."
"I ordered this shirt in a large and it was a bit big on me so I tried the medium.  It was way, way too small.  I liked the look, but unless there's a size between those two (!) I'm out of luck."
"Quality of shorts seems to be great.  Only problem is the sizing...they seem to run small, not the size indicated/ordered.  Will likely be returning these."
"I loved this skort from the moment I put it on! However, after just 10 days on the road it was showing signs of wear!  The skirt material became pilly on the outside where my shoulder bag rubbed it, and the skirt material was never quite wash-n-wear; it was always wrinkly after washing, whether it was line-dried or in the dryer.  I expected better from Columbia for the price."
"I purchased the cream/navy plaid lined with navy terry cloth, AND the purple. I never even opened the purple because the color was DEFINITELY NOT as presented since it is actually a very ugly brown-purple!! The purple is definitely going back!!

The cream/navy plaid is very attractive and I really like the terry lining and the to-the-ankle length. I am 5'5"", female, and am a size 16. The sizing guide is terribly flawed, as the suggested L/XL is very, VERY large. The shoulder seams come four inches down my arms and the front over wraps around me completely!! It is cozy but clunky and the shape is very unattractive!! I would trade for a S/M but of course the size wanted is never available. I may keep it and I may not.

UPDATE: sending the plaid back. It's just too big!! :("
I didn't really like it.. Look too cheap..
"They should have left the socks out of this shoe, they are a great shoe without the socks"
"Fun and playful.  Not super functional if you're wanting a real ""booby boost"", but they're a good lingerie accessory."
Ordered a large although I'm a size medium. Mostly for the concern on sleeves width and my somewhat heavy arms. The sleeves were too tight. Will have to return.
"Sucky quality considering how expensive it is. The material is incredibly thin. I was really worried about taking it out in the rain for Halloween. The pants are pretty tight (and I'm not a big guy) compared with the shirt. The hat is the biggest disappointment. I had to reinforce it with cardboard so the brim didn't flop around like a dead fish. Over-all, not impressed. Wish I had had the time to put together the costume myself."
"The quality of this petticoat is great for the price. The material is good, the fluff is great, and the length is as described.  But holy cow was that waistline tight.  The description lists is as ""waist around 66-110cm/26""-43.3"""" and there's no way.  I have a 26"" waistline, and while it fits, it is not comfortable.  There is no way a person with a larger waistline would feel comfortable with this at all.  I'll still use it for costumes, which is what I bought it for, but only when I'll be wearing costumes for a short time and not an all day thing."
"I love the look of these sandals but they are pricey and the edges started to fray within the first 2 uses. Also, for my 3 year old I should have known to buy velcro sandals, shame on me. The pair for my 6 year old have the same fraying problems as well."
"Super, super tight but really cute if you are super tiny.  I am size 4 and ordered the S/M - it was too small.  Pretty colors and the quality is fine, especially for the price."
Blue was a very bright blue not navy but I kept these. It is still comfortable and I found some things to pair with it.
Love the colors but skirt somewhat poofy with excess fabric. It would have been nicer if the skirt was less poofy. Looks better on model.
"I like the look and the feel, but for some reason it would make my two small fingers numb. I had to give them away."
they're comfy but don't look very good. i don't like how they look on me. i'll probably give this to my sister
"I think it's cute, just not on me."
"I felt like the shoe was too loose around the ankle.  Otherwise I adored the shoe.  The quality was good.  The heel height was good, but it was hard to walk in, due to the loose ankle.  Wish I could have kept this one."
Runs very small. Definitely want to order a bigger size next time . But iam going to try & squeeze into it.
Material was just okay.
"I know peoples feet are different, used to sell shoes so I get it. I really wanted to love these they are very cool looking and light but they felt huge and the heel was rock solid. Seemed very well made but I have heel pain and immediately knew they weren't going to work out. The shoes are dope, the comfort was not."
"the top was a nice fit but the bottoms were way too small and not at all giving. will keep the top, but the bottoms are too small."
I ordered my usual size and found it a little snug-short.
i got these in about a week they fit okay the keep rolling up but overall good for price i wear the over a strapless bra
"tight at first but perfect, but the bones aren't straight, they are slightly pix-elated zoom in on pic before"
This hat turned out to be high quality and I was very pleased one of the better constructed hats made by Condor ... I had some of there other hats and they turned out to be so so... This one has set the notch high so I ended up ordering another one in black and will be ordering more colors as they become avail... Very comfortable and fits perfectly for a big head ... SORRY for such a long delay in response after 3 months of owning the hat the color grey fades really bad ... I have more than one color in this hat and no fading exists with the others.
"This wig was purchased for my cosplay Christmas cards, so my fiance and I did Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask ugly Christmas sweater style. The wig worked well for the one time use that I bought it for, but I wouldn't buy this for an actual cosplay. It doesn't cover the hair in the back of the neck because it lacks little curlies to do so. My head is 21"" and it looked lumpy because it was too large for my head. Our photographer did a great job, so it looks really good in the photos. Understand that lots of brushing occurred because there was so much static cling with the pigtails and they stuck everywhere. Also, the buns are not detachable and lose their shape easily if you aren't careful. Overall, good for one shoot, but not for longtime wear. I did like that the ends of the pigtails were curled."
fits a bit small
Th4ese shoes were to small to get on my foot.  They seemed like they would be comfortable if they had fit.
"too short for a 5'9"""
"I actually wear a large in this style.  But reading the comments I ordered the XXL.  I'll enjoy wearing this, very comfortable"
"Top and bottom too tiny for me even though I'm slender at 5'3"" weighing 105lbs. You'll have to be SUPER tiny if you want to fit in it. Material leaves much to be desired with the white thread standing out against the colourful print"
"Pros:
These shoes are so lightweight and comfortable! My daughter has a history of rejecting shoes because they don't ""feel good"". If I buy her inexpensive shoes (like from a big box retailer) they rub on her very sensitive feet. She LOVES these. It's all she wants to wear. The colors are really fun and we get a lot of comments on how cute they are. I like that they are machine washable, but I've always put sneakers in the washer so that's nothing new for me.
Cons:
The downside of being lightweight and flexible is that these shoes do NOT hold up well. Her last pair actually got a good-sized hole in them in less than a year (and I'd only washed them once I believe.) Shoes at this price should last longer than that! I would give these shoes five stars if they were either less expensive ($30- 35 seems reasonable) or if they lasted longer so I didn't have to replace them so frequently!"
"I measured with a tape measure & according to the sizing directions I should wear a 44d, but I van just barely get this bra fastened in the loosest hooks. then the straps at their loosest are too short for the band to sit where it should.. I even used an extender I had purchased hoping to make another too small bra fit, but that  just made it finally feel like I wasn't being pinched.
But then after all this struggling the cups seemed a little too big and there was so much material in the whole front of the bra I felt like I was wearing a nun's habit!  I used to wear this same bra when I was younger & slimmer and never felt like i was completely encased like this. Maybe this style is just no longer right for me.  (I have copied this review from another one I just made for the slightly different bra from the same line and brand, since the situation was exactly the same for both bras)  The quality is there, just can't get them to fit!"
I can still open my gym locker even with this lock in place...hoping it will at least act as a deterrent so that a potential thief sees it and moves on to an easier target.
"Not sure why, but these dansko shoes are not as comfortable as all my other ones???.  The stitching around the outside toe of right shoe is a little off. When price drops on items does that mean the product is second or irregular merchandise?
I suppose I will not buy dansko style  number 506240202..."
Beautiful color.  Too narrow.
"I agree the die goes onto everything but after their 3rd wash it stopped.... the sizing is way off. I normally wear a 6-7 and I have to return for an 9. The fake zipper part has poor stitching. It came apart in the wash so I'm going to have to restich it closed again before I can wear them again. All in all I paid like $20 bucks for them so you get what you pay for. I was expecting a cheap pair of jeans, and I got just that. Also be warned, they are super long. I'm 5'2"" so I'm use to having long pants, but these are crazy long. I had to roll them up twice to wear in my boots."
The quality is good but I feel the fit is too small. I have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't slip off my head. I love ever the color though!
This is a very pretty dress only if you are small built. These dresses seem to be made for asian frames which is delicately small. The material is flimsy but not too bad. The dress clings-so it is not going to hide those rolls ;). however this would be a great dress for anyone less than 120 lbs. It flows really well and with a slip it is nice. It also has a nice collar that gives a frame to the shoulders which I usually like. But this dress is definitely not for big busted or heavy women.
"These boots were amazing however my calf is so thin that the boots made me look like I had toothpicks sticking out from them.  The sole of the boot was amazing and they were so comfortable and easy to walk in.  I wish they had an option where you could choose the calf circumference.  If they had, I would have be wearing them now."
a touch see-through
Gave this purse to my 6 year old great niece to play with the inside looked like a toy
"IT serves the purpose.very lite, thin leather. definitely feels blended. fresh out the plastic makes you wonder. may just need to break in. will post another review later if that's ok. not as if  I paid a lot."
"the shoes are nice when you look at them, but boy do they hurt your toes."
"Did the job, added fullness.
It was small around the waist and cut into my ""muffin top"" (which I really wasn't aware I had until I wore this article of clothing hahah) it's inexpensive and doesn't seem overly cheap... If you are looking for something to wear under a 50's style dress this will do the trick"
The top is really weird and it does NOT come with instruction how to tie so you have to just figure that out own your own.  The bottom is very skimpy and little bit a loose but not a problem with me.. Over all it's cute for the price. I gave 3 starts for not including the instruction and not having seller contact.
"I kept this since I can take the lace up. I have a smaller torso and this was a bit loose.
It is see through the lace part."
"Nice shoes but have a very loose feeling to them, if ordering might wanna get the size smaller than what you would usually purchase!"
"Im 32C, 5'4 and weigh 123 lbs, i ordered a LARGE and it could have definitely been tighter. I have a small waist , but irrespective of which, don't go ape s*** ordering 2/3 sizes up. Just order a size up and you're good."
No original box. Disappointed
"It is pretty. And it is as pictured.  However, RIGHT HANDED buyers should note that it opens differently than most wallets.  So it feels like it is really for LEFT HANDED users.  If you open it as a right handed person would (pull snap up with right hand, and the change pocket to the right) the bill and card section are pointed downward so that everything falls our.  If you are left handed it would probably be great for you.  But if you are a righty you probably want to skip it."
"A little clunky with somewhat of a large toe box for me. Wore these to the gym, but caused some mild soreness in my heels during weightlifting. Seemed satisfactory on the court, but I still prefer my lightweight running shoes."
Sleeves not as long as expected but I have long arms
I didn't try them on Sent them back.
"I'm 5'7"" with a 34"" waist, so a size 14 should have fit me generously according to Calvin Klein's size chart, which lists  but this was too small in the waist. Returning for a 16. It's a cute jacket, but very nipped in at the waist."
"I ordered the same size of this exact shoe as in 2015, and these are too large. Alas, will go to store and try them on."
I have 4 pair of these . One pair slightly smaller than the rest.
"It is as expected, not much for not much money. Cheesy feel, color is good, and it is a standard true crew neck."
super cute and comfy but I thought it was a tad expensive for the quality. It's worth it if you can't find something cheaper. I'd buy again if I had a seam ripped.
"I bought this bag for my daughter. She was looking at bags in stores and online when she found this. She absolutely loved it!

Stitching for the handles was weak. My wife re-stitched the handles and they haven't come loose again."
"I think these could be great shoes, but they run small! I wear a US 10 in tennis shoes, boots, and sandals. I don't buy many dress shoes. I ordered a 41, which is exactly what the size conversion chart suggests and they were insufferably small, like take them off immediately uncomfortable small."
"If you have flat foot, don't buy em. They are narrow. Look great though"
I would have kept this purse if it hadn't been imperfect. The two sides around the pocket were different sizes. I was showing to a friend and she noticed it. Filled it would've been even more noticeable!
boot is rough inside and it made a rash . need to wear high socks or tuck pants in so that it doesnt rub
Comfy and great for the hospital but not really made for my 34H breasts.
"This pair was the same size as the first pair I ordered, and they were smaller. Scared to order anymore..."
"Still undecided as to whether or not I am going to keep them. They are absolutely adorable & smell awesome, but they have a really weird fit, not at all like any of my other Fryes. That is why I only gave them 3 stars. Overall they run really large but in an odd sort of way.  Normally Fryes have a nice tight heel that holds your foot in place unless they are true cowboy boots like the Prairie Flowers, which are a bit loose in the heel but tighter in the instep. These are particularly big around the ankle around the front part, so the heel slips up & down when you walk. They are somewhat loose around the front like Carson Lugs are after you've worn them awhile. The length is like the Carson Shorts & the Carson Lugs. I know Fryes stretch so if I keep them how big & sloppy will they get? If I send them back for a smaller size, will they be too short? I ordered a 7.5, would possibly exchange for a 7. All of my Fryes are a 7.5 except the shearling ones which are an 8 because of the shearling.
Update: I ordered the size 7, which were narrower & did not slip in the heel but were too short so I am keeping the 7.5 & wearing them with thicker socks, they are just too cute too not keep. I sent the 7's back , since it was the first time I have returned anything to Amazon I didn't know what to expect. It was so easy & simply amazing ! I see why Amazon is #1!"
"These seem like great boots. And I don't see many others complaining about this, so perhaps the one we got was just missized. But I ordered a 5 for my daughter, and they were humongous. They were big on me, and I wear a 6 1/2-7!"
"I bought the number seven for toddler and is like saying the number five very small and very narrow, the quality is good, sorry my child not serve him, comfortable and easy to put look. but very narrow."
"Not baggy, the fit is okay. True to size and the color looks great"
"I am a long-time user of vitamin C products, currently addicted to the gold standard, which I have been applying every morning. I liked the idea of an overnight C product, and since DCL has a good reputation and is cruelty-free, I thought I would try the C-Scape. I have been using it for the last three weeks.

I have not experienced the grittiness, stickiness, or stinging reported by others. To me, it's more like applying a thick and inert paste, kind of like embalming cream but less stinky. In fact, there's very little fragrance, and definitely not the signature C smell that I associate with C products. Maybe that's due to the formulation, which is supposed to ensure a gradual release of ingredients throughout the night. But I know that C degrades quickly, and I'm wondering whether this has any effective C content at all.

I like the dispenser and the pump has worked perfectly from day one.  It always amazes me when companies ask a high price but then expect customers to struggle with a finicky dispenser, like the last night-time product I've used. Don't cheap out!

I realize this product works for others -- people either seem to love it or hate it. And it hasn't damaged my skin, but there are no apparent benefits."
The elastic becomes loose after wearing few times. it keeps coming out of my baby's feet. Not very satisfied.
"The scarf is ok, it doesn't lay like the picture.
We are trying to stretch out one of them to see if we can get it to lay like the picture shows.
Otherwise they are really warm so that is nice especially with the cold weather setting in."
Love this sweater but it is extremely long.
baggie legs
Pretty! but disappointingly clear. I read the reviews and saw the photos but it's even clearer in person. No visible green tint.
two problems: too tight and does not cover all of the ears when flaps are down.  Looks like and is an excellent quality hat though.  Supplier says I should order one or 1-1/2 sizes up.
"Great looking sandal, however I should have listened to what other had to say before purchase. I love Merrell shoes and was dissapointed with the lack of comfort, cushion and flexibility with these shoes.  They feel like a lower quality shoe. Unfortunately I had to return these to get something different."
"I usually get the Old Friend scuff slippers, but decided to try these. They're fit small and were not as cushy as my regular slippers."
"Purchased for my daughter who has not yet delivered - the top of the gown seems a little big at this point and the bottom half fits tighter than expected but we are hoping that post delivery it will fit well.  Thought there might be some sort of pocket in the bra area to hold some nursing pads but there isn't so again, we are hoping that the fit will be snug enough to hold nursing pads in place when sleeping.  For the price, there could have been better pictures and description of this gown."
"I want to love you New Balance I really do, but once again the cushioning you promise is just not there. I still buy this model when a new version comes out to see if I like it. Shoes in the $150 range should not disappoint and not bottom out. That being said, I'll use these for the 6 mile and under runs and stick with the Asics Nimbus for the long runs. Also, this model is no longer made in USA so that's a bummer because that's how I used to justify paying a higher price for running shoes. I like the styling though and I need a 2E wide shoe which NB is good about making available in most models."
"It fits like regular tshirt size. I ordered one size larger than what I was going to order after looking at their own sizing chart picture. I even compared their measurement with my existing tshirt and found out that their sizing chart was very different than other tshirts I own.
It turns out, I shouldn't have order the larger size because it's huge. I am very disappointed because it doesn't offer free return/exchange.
The color and the print of the shirt is great, the material of the shirt is great.
It would've been perfect if the sizing was correct."
These are really pretty and fit well but they are a little uncomfortable between toes which is weird since I always where this type of sandal.
My son has the 13.5 and I bought this pair 14 to last longer to him and they are exactly the same size. Disappointed
"These were beautiful, but the backs on them were small.  I bought these for my 18 month old so she wouldn't rip her earring backs off, but the screws made me worried.  The shipping was fast and we received them in a timely manner, but i wouldn't recommend them for a child... While they did stay in her ears she pulled and tugged until it stretched the hole and i had to take them out anyway..."
poor quality stitching
"Fit was really really tight, but was really cute, wish it would have fit better. I am a 36D, but a small person,  and should have for sure ordered a Xtra large."
"Have 7 this "" type"" hats it's the only one that doesn't fit"
"I normally wear a 38 c and that's what I got, but it fit smaller than expected."
its large for a small its just a big shirt can't get it to hug my frame.
Comfy shoes but slippery. I didn't like the laces very much  because they're too long but they serve their purpose. Liked the price but I can also find a similar product and of better finish at any store for the same amount
WE LOVED IT!!!!!  Got a great price!!!  But the mask hurt my kids head and his forehead actually kinda bruised :(  So it will likely never be work again.
"If the dress hem was sewn evenly, it would be an awesome piece.  However, the dress arrived and the right side was a little over 2 inches longer than the left side.  I laid it out and measured with a measuring tape to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me.  I would have returned the product, but I do know how to sew so I hemmed the bottom to be symmetrical.  After this adjustment, great dress.  I have ordered Beachcoco dresses previously and have not had a problem with quality.  This piece in particular must have slipped through the cracks."
When I purchased this hat the color was listed as white. I just received it in the mail and it was definitely khaki/tan. Extremely disappointed. Had I known it was khaki I wouldn't have ordered it.
"I have been looking for a reasonably-priced canvas sneaker in a wide size for YEARS with no luck. The Levis sneakers were rumored to run a bit large, so I decided to try them. Nope...

I gave these sneakers 3 stars because if I keep them laced loosely they don't fit too bad, but they are VERY narrow for a D-width. PLUS, the lack of padding on the heel of the sneaker makes for a VERY uncomfortable summer wear unless you're wearing socks,, which I HATE doing with sneakers in the summer."
"These shoes are pretty comfortable for running. The left shoe crowds my toes a bit, but then again I have weird feet. It's hard for me to find shoes that are good enough."
"It seems very tight.  Putting on 3 yr old, even though I bought size 4T.  The zipper is difficult to zip up from leg to body."
Not as comfortable as my other style of Rockport walkers.
"Very cute, decent quality, but the reviews said they run large.  I disagree.  My daughter is between a 5 and 6 right now so I ordered a size 5 and they were way to small."
"Gave review on these. Great invention for Omega backs as they are be as uncomfortable as some clip-on.  Only problem with these are they move around on back of earring.  Could be more cushiony as these are hard plastic not gel.  What can be said abt. them is, found solution by using a bit of arabic gum to hold into place, is earring sit's better on earlobe, especially on dangle earrings."
"These are really beautiful looking boots. That said, aside from the wrong size being delivered, they are extremely narrow. They must run fairly large as I was able to fit into a full size smaller than what I wear so I would maybe go 1/2 size smaller than your usual size."
"A bit large, and the sleeves feel like they are an astronauts. But the material is soft and it is durable, as it has been washed several times and still maintains its color and texture"
fits very big even in xs.
"While the onesie is well made and arrived promptly, after washing I was really surprised at how small it was. I ordered two more Little Me 3-month onesies at the same time and they all fit the same, unfortunately. I'm bummed my child can only wear them for like 2 weeks before they are too small!"
These are great boots but i think i got a defected one. My one boot had an inside overlap of leather and it kept rubbing on my foot which hurt until i cut it out. Also kne of the soles are mis shaped.
"I purchased these boots because of the price.  I needed something to warm wear around the barn when the temps were in the single digits, and I didn't want to spend a hundred dollars only to walk in horse manure.  These boots are warm.  They are NOT  water resistant so I applied Camp Dry to help out with that problem.  While the shoe feels rather snug with socks on, it has a tendency to feel like it is slipping when walking.  They don't feel secure in place on the foot.  However,  they have not been sucked off when walking in ankle deep mud. The soles are grippy, and I also use these boots to walk the fence line. They held up well crossing the creeks and going across sippery rocks.  These boots will not work if you have large calves.  I'll admit I don't have bird legs, and my calves are about all these boots can fit around.  The velcro is secure and stays in place.  Order a size larger if you have thick socks.

So if you need cheap boots to keep your feet warm, this product will do nicely."
"The leg holes are tight but don't really keep urine in.  I cannot see using these as training pants.  The disposable type go on much easier but since one pack costs the same as this diaper, I'll be sticking with this one."
I've to return as it was big on me. I ordered a size up thinking it would not fit on my thigh area but it runs true to size. Ordered my regular size large and it fit perfectly on my 39-31-43 body.;) very sexy.
"The boots are very nice looking. However, I found that they run very narrow."
"I ordered a size 12 for my 101 pound 12 year old son.  I bought a size 12 based on his measurements and customer comments in the reviews.  I was a little disappointed because the vest (though marked a 12 like the rest of the suit) was much smaller than the jacket so he wasn't able to wear it at all.  The rest of the suit fit well- the pants just made it on length and the arms were a tad short (while the shirt sleeves were a little longer than the suit sleeves)- but a 14 would have been too big.  I think the quality was well enough for the price- I think the buttons made it look a little more expensive than it is.  I didn't want a suit that was too heavy as it was to be worn for a May wedding so I didn't mind that the suit wasn't a thicker quality material.  I just felt bad about the vest being so small- he did want to wear a vest and it seemed like it was marked the wrong size because it was not able to button and also too short....
Update: June 4th, 2013, My son put the suit on (minus the too small vest) to wear to a wedding it was purchased for.  After an hour of wearing it (just sitting down at the ceremony) the back of the jacket seam all came unsewn!  He was very self concious about the two inch hole and he didn't wear the jacket for the rest of the wedding :("
"I have washed the two I purchased 3 times because of the strong odor right out of the package.
No one else has mentioned this in any of the reviews. I can't seem to get rid of the odor.
I'll just keep washing them and hope it goes away."
"I was hoping these were like yoga pants, they're more of a thicker sweatpants. Still cute though"
"like the sandals but they are narrow compared to my other keen shoes.  Love keens, just not this style."
"Not what I thought I bought, but I can wear them."
"A five-star product if you don't mind the bulges that happen where the fat pops out at the bottom. The picture SHOWS capri length which is what I need -- my bad for not reading ""Mid Thigh"" in the description, but still..."
Cute but looks somewhat cheap in person. However it is still cute and I will likely wear it out sometime.
"Ordered umbrella to replace a Tote that I previously lost!  It has massive coverage and am pretty sure a village could get under it and stay completely dry, however it is bulky and quite heavy to carry in my purse.  Wish I could find the previous Tote umbrella, but fear they no longer make it."
"These are a little too big for my 2 month old.  If I don't fold them over, they slip off too easily.  They fit me, though.  So, I know they will grow with him.  They're pretty cute.  But, I wish there were better colors."
"Looks as pictured, very small. Sparkly and pretty, but made with very cheap, easily bent metal.
If you have metal allergies, do NOT buy, they will probably irritate your skin.

They get bent out of shape very easily and repeated adjustments will break the metal eventually.
Good for a costume or very infrequent wearing... Either buy better quality jewelry or several for backup."
"Would have preferred the bags to feel a bit more flexible. But should work for travel packing,as there is a nice variety of sizes,for small items."
"This ring has a very small ""opal"" stone.  The ""opal"" is not very shimmery or sparkly at all.  It looks like a bead of glitter glue.  If you want an authentic looking ring, this is not it.  I sent it back."
High quality and budget too
Boots were too large and arrived in a crushed box.  I had to return them.
Was coming apart at a seam when we got it but it worked for the 1 day we needed it! Cute costume!
"There is a measuring chart for this item that I followed as closely as possibly because I hate buying shoes.  It's not off.  It's just not meant for house use.  I measured my foot, no sock, with a ruler but I didn't have a good way to make sure the edge of my heel lined up.

This caused a bit of a problem.  I had to order one pair, try it on, wrap it up and get the return started.  Before I actually got the return started I ordered a second pair half a size smaller.  So, I went from the measurement of a size 8 (I'm not a size 8 in any shoes) to a 7.5 (which I am in half my shoes).  The reason I bothered with the 8s at all was because 17 years ago, before Amazon, I had to order directly from Bates.  I recall ordering two pairs, 2 sizes and getting a phone call asking if I was sure I wanted two pair of boots in 2 sizes.  Of course I didn't.

So, the 8s were too big in multiple ways.  The 7.5s are fine.  They are massively stiff, as to be expected."
The t-shirt is just made really odd.  The medium is a small.  There are no returns.
Head is not completely covered on top (forehead and top hair part). It fits somehow large on top but quite well on the neck.
Im usually between and 2x-3x... these were waaaaaaay too small
"Very nice camis.. Soft and probably well made.

. But they run small.. I am usually a medium. - I ordered up to a large, and they were still uncomfortably tight."
I have bought several rings from Amazon and they are beautiful.  This ring did not keep it's sparkle like my other rings.
"The shirt is really comfortable, even when running in hot, humid weather. The orange color of the shirt is actually a good deal lighter than shown in the picture (neon orange heather) and a little feminine for my taste. The picture close up seems to show it as orange with darker gray, when in fact it's orange with white, for a sort of creamsicle effect."
"Nice, but this is not peach. It is clearly beige or tan. This is a very large scarf."
"I'm happy enough with my jewelry tree, but I was slightly disappointed over how incredibly flat it is. The picture makes it look like some of the leaves are bending a bit this way and that, and they're not -- nor can they be, without breaking them off (I tried!)

Other than that slight misunderstanding on my part (the purpose for this review), it's pretty. The necklaces would hang better from a more 3D tree with branches going this way and that, and that's what I was hoping for.

It still looks nice enough, even with all my necklaces and earrings on it. Lots of places for stuff."
Not as durable as I would like. The handles broke off and the insoles have come out. A pair I bought at Target has lasted longer
"But just 1shoe, the other is fine. And yes my feet are the same size"
It's okay...but it really looks a bit different than the photo
"Returned it. The velcro in back was scratching me no matter how I adjusted it. The one side of the velcro was longer than the other side. Probably might have been better it velcro was shorter, but I also felt like it kept falling down and I did not want to wear the straps. My other one has no straps and does the job fine."
"I would have given this a lower rating but I have to give credit for timley delivery and possibly my misunderstanding of what I was getting played a part in my not being satisfied with product.
For the positive on this product, it is very vibrant, very pretty colors.
Now for the negative:
First: I was expecting a fleece type sweatshirt/hoodie as I was getting it to keep me warm this winter.  The fabric is not warm and fuzzy inside but rather it would be cold and would not breath well.  It is supposed to be a cotton/polyester blend but is more like ALL polyester, no cotton feel to it at all.  Think of cheap women's dress slacks made from polyester.
Second:  I like my sweatshirts very roomy so I ordered a 2x and a 3x to see which one fit better.  Turns out they are both exactly the same.  The label on hoodie reads 2x/3x.  I really thought I was ordering 2 different sizes.
Third:  I typically wear anywhere form 1x to 2x in shirts, coats, etc.  Even though this was 2x/3x size, it was VERY small and snug fit.
I will be looking for another hoodie but very careful this time to make sure it is a FLEECE lined hoodie and sized correctly."
My daughter is about a size 10-11. I thought maybe if I ordered an 11 it'll fit and leave some tiny room for her to grow in. Boy was I wrong! It left a humongous amount of room for her to grow in....... She probably won't be able to wear this shoe until 5+ years later....
These are decent slippers. I was replacing for a pair that was worn out.  They do the job as expected.
"The socks are great, but you don't get what you order. I thought I was getting 6 pairs of Black socks. I got 3 black and 3 grey. I'll wear them; it's not worth the hassle of sending them back because (based on the packaging) I'd only get the same thing sent again. They should be better about their marketing descriptions!"
"I am a 17 1/2 Neck and an exact 34/35 sleeve in all Men's dress shirts EXCEPT for this one.  I wanted to give this a try because of the great price.  I read the other reviews regarding the sizes and ordered an 18 neck, 34/35.  The neck was perfect, but the sleeves only came up to the top my wrist.  Reality was that even tho the shirt says 34/35 it's truly a 32/33 sleeve.  I sent it back and am awaiting my replacement of 18 Neck 36/37 sleeve.  The quality felt good, and I like the versatility of the cuff link and button duo.  However, the sizes should be more precise.  So lesson learned, Order one size bigger both neck and sleeve length and you will be happy."
"A little on the large side, but since I usually wear it over a t-shirt it works fine. Seems to work well against the sun's rays-but it sure does get hot!
Doesn't do a very good job of absorbing moisture - especially in our hot/humid climate."
Cute but runs small. I bought this for my 8yr old and it is small. She is a skinny tall thing so I didn't think I would have to worry.
"I normally wear a size 14 but always order up on Amazon.  The midsection area design wasn't in tact you kindof had to place them in line once you got the dress on.  The red was a little too bright for me. Made me look much bigger than I really am so not a good thing lol. Other than these things, the dress is cute."
This dress is cute but the fabric and the look of the bow makes it look more like a play dress than the eloquent picture posted.
Kind of cheap  did not last very long  will get some thing more expensive next time  don't waste your time on this
"It's a cheap box. Not quite the quality I was hoping for for the boyfriend's stone collection. BUT, usable and he was happy."
"nice for what i need it for. tangles VERY easily, however, and definitely not as long as it says."
"Nice dress, material is a little thin, would wear tights underneath. Hits mid thigh"
A very polyester-y polyester.
I was excited to see this has a separate zippered coin pouch - from the description here. But it's not sewn correctly and at the bottom of both sections there is enough gap that anything smaller than a quarter will fall out. The rest of the wallet is fine.
The picture shows a very fitting style however I should have purchased at least two sizes smaller than I usually buy. Very disappointing as it makes returning them uneconomic with Intetnational Mail costs.
Material left between weave. Not bad though.
Heavier than expected.  The blend makes you sweat more.
"This is not a ""One Size Fits All"" dress. I am 5'10 150 and the skirt was way too large. The waste is a stretch band, which fit nice. However, the skirt itself had far too much material. If you have additional money and can have it brought in it may be a worthy purchase."
they are a little tight around the toes
ran small in the thigh
"This shirt's fabric is comfortable right out of the package. It is lightweight and soft to the touch, and that includes the collar. Most other new shirts have stiff collars that become comfortable only after a number of washings. The shirt feels a bit tighter on my husband than a standard medium, and thus is a little uncomfortable for that reason.

My husband hates logos on clothing, but the Hilfiger logo on the pocket of this shirt is so small that it is unobjectionable to him. The major problem with the shirt is its price. Why would we spend $69.50 on this (its current price on Amazon) when we can buy a comparable one for much less? For example, this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrangler-Men-s-Rugged-Wear-denim-shirt/dp/B006HYLHRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear denim shirt</a>&nbsp;is currently less than half the price of the Hilfiger."
These khaki pants will serve their purpose and look OK but they are not really a quality product.  Similar purchases in the past were constructed better and had better features.
"The size is what I expected but it just fits kind of off, like it wasn't taken time on to sew, just thrown together. It's kind of a spandex material and if it is not worn with the proper attire it looks completely tacky. It's ok but I wouldn't buy another."
"It's an ok shirt, but I was a bit disappointed in the fit.  I ordered a size larger than I'd normally wear (as instructed) because I'm in my third trimester, but found that it just kinda drapes over my body.  I wish it fitted me like the picture shows, and I'm guessing it probably would have IF I had bought my normal size.  I still wear it because it's not BAD looking (I actually like the big buttons), but I wish it fit better.  Bummer."
Straps really cut  into my foot and the fabric is very stiff.  Too bad b/c they would have been cute knock around shoes.
I expected a bit more color.  Nice design.  S&H were fine.  Size was spot on.  Was just hoping for more of a pop of color.
"After reading other reviews I ordered a size up and the medium fits my 6 yr old perfectly. It is a pretty basic costume, like most you'd see in stores. I took away 2 stars because we did NOT receive a mask. Previous reviews lead me to believe I would've been scrambling for a last minute mask anyway. Also it took 9 days to get here, which seems to be a growing trend for Amazon. When I did get it, my package was completely destroyed. Like mangled! I don't know when or where the damage took place but no harm done so I didn't report it. In all its fine, but I could've gotten the same thing a lot easier at a local store."
"Its great gift for kids, they would definitely love it. Its plastic and so good looking for a transparent band. Bold numbers easy to read. Its light weight and perfect for any outdoor activities. The cons is the band has a tendency to stick to the skin whenever sweating and for my experience its a little discomfort but so far i don't have skin rashes from it. To some who is has a sensitive skin maybe a little careful though but all in all this is a great product.
I received this product at a discount price in exchanged for my unbiased and honest review."
"These socks aren't as good as I expected, but are worth the price you pay."
Small and little solid not as expected
"I do like these jeans, however, I wish the fit was a bit tighter. They remind me of ""mom jeans"" but more of a modern day mom jean,, if that even makes any sense lol...  They say skinny fit, but they are a straight fit, so you do get that extra fabric bunching around the knees, which I don't care for. I bought the size 4 short, for reference I am just shy of being 5' 3"" I weigh 130lbs, my waist is 26.5 inches and my hips are 37 inches. The fit is a little strange. I usually get that gap in the waist with jeans because I do have an ass, and it requires a bigger size than my waist, but these were really big in the waist. In the attached pictures you can see that the pants fit everywhere but my waist. I am still going to keep them because I bought these for work, (I am a nanny) so I want to be comfortable but still look like I didn't just roll out of bed and put sweat pants on lol. My ass keeps the pants up, so even though the waist is big, they stay in place for the most part. I might order a size 2, I will update this review if I do...

If the fit was skinner, and the waist was smaller, they would get a 5 star rating."
I give it a three-star because I had to return it. I have a low Arch and it has too much Arch. Lots of room in the forefoot and color is Vivid and true!
It fits me just a bit tight. The XL would have been better rather than a Large.
"So I purchased this coat based on my waist and arm size. My arm size is 33.5-35 inches and my waist size is 32-34 inches. The medium fits perfectly. The materials makes this coat very wearable and it's quite smooth.

It has two small holes for your thumb to go into, making this coat cover the palm of your hands. Note: they're very small so I had to loosen it a bit. Overall, this coat is very warm and can handle rain well.

If you want a jacket with a bit more room, I suggest buying it by chest and shoulder measurements. Waist and arm size helps you get a fitted size if your chest size is not a large as mine (I'm average in weight and size, which is 150lbs.

Uodate: after a few weeks/a month, this item starts breaking.  This still keeps you warm, but for it's price, it shouldn't break this quickly."
Very thin fabric. cute top cant really wear a bra so things show through..
"This was somewhat tight and small on me. I am 5 ft tall Latina, and I am CURVY. I'm about 140 pounds and these were tighter than normal tights i own, I didn't like that about these socks.

Also the skin color is not opaque, but luckily my skin color is close to beige that the socks are so I was fine with it.

Shipping was great, socks are cute, but not very comfy for me."
Bought this for my elderly mom who is a size 4 - 6. I bought small at it's a little tight on her. I'm assuming they will stretch over time and fit a little better.
They're run a tad small
"The glasses are little too narrow for my face. Well, it maybe because my face is little too wide."
"they are good for colder weather. I wanted something in leather and it's really hard to find these days. Apparently there is a shortage of cow hide out there... Anyway, they run a little big but that's good because then my inserts fit as well."
"Seems like an OK shoe, but my toe hit the end of the shoe so I had to return it. Not a high quality construction,  but ok for the price."
"Needed new luggage and saw this reviewed on a tv show.  I can't believe how many compliments I received on the color alone.  However, I purchased this for the durability.  I was a bit disappointed that on it's inaugural flight, the luggage was scratched up when I picked it up from the baggage claim.  Additionally, the wheels are very hard, they got eaten up on a one-block roll from the NYC sidewalk and it was a bit hard to roll across the street.  Perhaps, this luggage better suited for a more civilized environment.  That said, now that I'm over being upset from the damage from one trip, am interested in seeing how this will hold up in the long term."
"fair product. out of the 6 that I bought, 2 of them are not cut straight. rectangular. but i use them to keep pvc glue, mastic, and vulkem outta my hair. so they don't live long anyway. material is thinner than most that i buy, so may not make it through a lot of washings. but again, they are affordable. so they will do fine for me. they are large, which is a big plus to me being i seem to have a fat head. lol. 22 inchers just don't do it. hope any of this helps."
"I purchased this for my husband, who loves cotton sweaters.  He really likes the fabric and the style; this shirt is as comfortable as a sweatshirt, but is nice enough to wear to the office.

The problem is the neck.  It's weird.  It neither stands up nor lays down, and is annoying to wear (husband says).  Perhaps washing will cure that, but I'm afraid it's a design flaw."
"Very pretty, tips easily."
Small and bad stitching
that's ok.
Doesn't keep great time have to reset a lot.
it looks like costume
Turns gold after a few months of constant wear...
It's a good bra.  Had to be returned because my elderly mother couldn't put it on herself.
So the inside diameter of the 5 mm I got was actually wrong. The whole ring itself was 5 mm. So I sized up to 7 mm and it works perfectly for my nose ring. Easy to close. Looks cute.
"This look wonderful. Do not order them unless you have STRONG earlobes. They are heavy. I can wear them with my hair down, but not up or you see them pulling my ears so much. Quality is wonderful though."
"This isn't the best veil, but cheap is in the name! I bought this veil to wear at my wedding shower and/or bachelorette party."
This shoe did not fit at all - too small and too narrow. It seemed two sizes too small. Otherwise it was a good shoe.
"Bought the size I generally wear in wolverine boots.  When they arrived, one boot went on ok, could never get the other foot into the other boot, too tight.  Compared both boots side-by-side and they appeared to match in size and width.  Returned boots for purchase price less about 20%.  Bought a pair of Justin's from local store where I could try them on first - they fit perfect.  Nothing against wolverine (have several pair) but for me I like the ability to test drive boots before purchase as boots seem to vary greatly in fit even though they are sized the same."
"Meh, it is just O.K. The quality of the fleece is certainly not up there with something from Columbia. Also, I don't like the elastic bunched cuff at the wrists. It is a bit uncomfortable. Definitely not a slim fit either. Even at the sale price, I have seen and bought better quality from local discount stores."
"I purchased another color of these socks (white with polka dots https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KEE7F4A/ref=twister_B01KEE7F7W?_encoding=UTF8&th=1 ) and really liked them so I thought I would try this tie dye color.  Unfortunately, the material seems to be different in this color.  They feel more like thick nylons, snag easily, and offer no compression.  Granted, my calves are tiny and even the polka dot ones offer little compression, but I do feel like the dots are are thicker and provide some support.  I'm bummed because I was hoping to buy the tie dye in all three colors.  Guess I'll be sticking to the polka dots!"
"The size is good. The picture isn't clear and you can't read the names of the books. Bummer. Also there are 2 pieces of glitter that don't belong in this necklace, which would drive me crazy if it were mine, its a graduation gift. Came in a plastic bag. Shipping time was decent. I think I should've picked a different design."
was somewhat small and not wide for a EE shoes
"I'm about a size 10, pear-shaped.  The problem is it fit my hips and legs but the waist was huge and you couldn't make it tight enough with the drawstring so it gave me an odd shape.  I actually think they made me look bigger.  Too bad because I love the pink.  The material would definitely be super clingy wet.  And I would say the material is pretty thing........so dimple hiding with these!"
the pants keep rolling up while sleeping. should have elastic in the pant leg.
nice watch but way over priced. hoping it will come down after Fathers Day.
"I really liked the design of this coat. Based on mixed reviews I wanted to order a small, but was unavailable so I ordered a medium. The medium was way too big. I really liked the style of the coat though. I'm 5'7, 123lbs slim built. This is a light weight jacket, not to be used for winter jacket, but perfect for fall weather."
The watch arrived on time. The watch looks nice but setting it up is a pain. The buttons have to be pressed very hard and my finger tips were worn out after setting it. The instruction manual is difficult to read. The analog time is nice but the digital readout is difficult to see. The instructions for sizing the band were not correct for this watch. It is not all stainless steel; just the back is. The watch is light which is a plus. I would not recommend this watch for anyone who is not a watch collector; they would not have the patience or desire to use all the functions.
just a tad small i recommend getting a size bigger just to be safe other than that the hat is great
"Not exactly what I was expecting. I was surprised that it was so thin. Based on the picture, I was expecting it to less flimsy."
Its pretty.... but one of the stones was off and the elastic band was all snapping.
"These shoes looked very sturdy in the catalog and online, but they seem a little flimsy, and the right one is quite a bit looser than the left shoe.  I wore them all day, and noticed that a couple of times my right foot slid over the outside of the shoe.  Not too good if you are unsteady on you feet.  Since I wore them all day, I didn't feel that I could return them, so will continue to wear them. They are comfortable aside from the right one being looser.  It is as if the elastic is stretched more on that one.  Anyway, I can live with them, just was a little disappointed."
"The bag is nice and light, could hold a lot and looks sturdy; however, the zipper opening is smaller than the actual bag and the straps are in the way of opening it. Unfortunately I had to send it back as it wouldn't work for my purposes."
Doesn't fit as snugly as I would like and I'm afraid it might slide off my feet at times.
"Heel looks absolutely beautiful on, is as pictured in the image provided. The strapping is a little lose making it easy for you to slip with it on... Extremely comfortable. The edges became lose though after two wears, nothing that can't be fixed. I"
Very cute tote bag. Nice style and good functional bag. BUT.....SMELLS SO BAD! Arrived smelling like a mixture of fish and gasoline!!! I'm still airing it out and spraying with fabric deodorizer. Hoping the smell dissipates so I can use it without feeling self conscious.
"I am generally a fan of Merrell footwear, and while these are great shoes and very comfortable, they come with one design flaw that, for me, makes them unacceptable:  The Vibram soles are DANGEROUSLY SLIPPERY in wet conditions on certain surfaces.

I wore my pair of Merrell Moab Ventilators daily for about three months, and in that time, I experienced about three instances where I came very close to injuring myself in wet conditions.  Most notably, while crossing an intersection in downtown Seattle on a drizzly evening, I was stepping across a metal plate on the road and my right foot nearly came out from under me (think banana peel scene in a cartoon).  Had I been rushing or, perhaps, a little intoxicated, I could've seriously injured myself.

Based on my experience, this Vibram sole has absolutely ZERO grip and becomes extraordinarily slippery on certain painted or metal surfaces when conditions are wet.  I haven't used them for hiking but can only assume this may apply to some situations you encounter on the trails (like wet rocks).

I know a lot of guys in the military and law enforcement who swear by Moab Ventilators and have used them daily at training academies and throughout deployments in the Middle East.  I even noticed Bradley Cooper was wearing them in ""American Sniper,"" and I'm assuming that's because the movie's consultants chose these and, knowing Clint Eastwood's meticulous nature and attention to detail, that probably means a genuine bad-ass like Chris Kyle used these shoes.  Normally, that'd be all the endorsement I would ever need.  For my purposes, however, I just cannot trust them for my intended purposes.

There is a chance I may be attending a very rigorous federal training program next year that will require me to be in comfortable hikers almost every day.  I have heard that Merrell is a popular choice there, but considering that one injury will take me out of the program, I simply cannot trust my physical well-being to a shoe I've had such troubling experiences in.  If I'm accepted to this program, I will be wearing my go-to hiker:  the Keen Targhee II.

I own five pairs of Keens and three different variations of the Targhee II, and being that this is the natural competitor to the Moab I thought I'd post just a few observations and comparisons.

1)  The Targhee II has better cushioning than the Moab.  Moab is a stiffer shoe.

2)  The Moab feels ever-so-slightly more stable than the Targhee II, which I believe comes from the Vibram's slightly wider and flatter base in the heel.  None of that perceived stability matters, however, if the Moab is going to come out from under me as soon as it starts raining.

3)  The Targhee II is water-proof (Keen Dry, not Gore Tex) and is slightly hotter than the Moab.  Not by much, and I'm perfectly comfortable using my Targhee II Mid Tactical hikers in humid tropical summers.  That said, I've stomped through wet fields in my Moab Ventilators and my socks never got wet so there's definitely some resistance to water even without the Gore-Tex.

4)  The Merrell upper is slightly more padded and cushioned.  I don't care for fluffy uppers, however, so the Keen scores better with me.

5)  Keen's well-known wider toe box is definitely more accommodating than the Moab for wider feet.  I have moderately wide feet and, while I generally get a 10.5EE in most brands (Merrell) the Keen in 11D fits me fine.

6)  Keen's soles DO NOT SLIP in wet conditions.  They have phenomenal grip on all surfaces I have encountered so far.

Bottom line:  Keen is more comfortable (for me), safer and in the same price range.  I've always been happy with them and plan to be a Keen customer for many years."
Order a little smaller than usual
"I just received my shirt, and haven't had a chance to wear it yet.  The sizing chart was not as accurate as I hoped.  I ordered an XXL hoping it would be ok for size 12.  It is baggy and long (like a tunic), but I am going to keep it. The side inserts will not allow me to take the seams in.  I think it is too much of a hassle to return it, and its better to have it too big than too tight.  I can't comment on the quality of it yet."
This hat was huge! It's not labeled correctly. I returned it.
I picked the regular size instead of the wide.  It was way too wide for me.  Next I will buy regular size with Rockport.
l honestly liked this but after a few hours of wear i sweated off the adhesive and bra fell off talk about akwarrddddd
it is somewhat narrow
"Material is light and nice as expected.  The area under arms is tight and I imagine it would fit someone who wear size small only.  I wear size medium petite and I found it a little tight, but not uncomfortable.  I keep it because I like the material and I use it only at night or in the morning for California summer."
"I had ordered the same size before this purchase and they fit perfectly.  These, however, are much tighter."
"I like the shoes a lot. However, they run a little small. I wear a size 9 and ordered a size 42, which is supposed to be a 9.5, but feels like a size 8.5. Remember Chinese manufacturers, Americans are taller and have big feet."
"The waist and length were correct, but the jeans are too tight to my thighs, and ""button fly""  is too hard  ..."
"The pants are okay, and they fit me well, but the material feels a bit cheap. I don't think it will last me over a year of wearing it. I wouldn't buy these shorts again."
"The fabric is soft , but holds its shape , and the design is comfortable but elegant . Can be cAsual or dressed up . Should be pressed a bit after washing. The sleeves are the pain. Roll up, fasten with a gold strap device-have to be rewound every time-don't hold their fold."
This jacket vest is beautiful but the size was completely off. I ordered a medium and it fitted like a XXL. ;(
"I was uncertain whether the socks looked more girly or not. Ordered the ""boys"" which still look girly. But I love to mismatch my kiddo's socks so i got them. Still not sure how I feel about a couple of them. And they say girls right on the box."
"Got these for my daughter for comic con for her cosplay. We bought a half size up. They are still too small for her. We didn't return them because they fit her sister and she wanted them, but if it hadn't been for her sister wanting them, I would have had to send them back."
"These fit well in the top and were comfy but the medium was several inches too long for me (with flat shoes), and I'm 5'6""."
look great but too small/poor shaping at bustline. fabric is great.
It's a bit smaller and cheaper looking than I'd hoped. The clasp is cute though.
The quality is very good but the fit is small.  I should have ordered a larger size.  I would recommend anyway.
They fit as expected. Nice light material for warmer weather. Decent price.
"It is an absolutely beautiful jumpsuit, but it did not fit as I expected. I believe going up one size from what I normally buy would have helped with that."
"For a handmade product I expected it to stay together longer, I expected better quality.  After 2-weeks the zipper fell off one shoe and the other she is falling apart.  I'm not happy that after a month I need to take these shoes to a shoe REPAIR!  On a positive note, they are super cute and even though they run a little small, I still LOVE them"
"It's pretty nice, but it would be better if the shirt possessed two more wolfs. That would make the shirt epic."
"Mych to my surprise this pair of jeans did not fit like the others even though they were simply selected as a different color.  If you get the darker color, be prepaired to get a smaller size and a lower rise in the waist.  I was disappointed because the others, of the exact size and discription, fot perfectly.  Interesting that being a different color means being a different cut."
Very light. fragile. But decent value for money
"too Wide, too Flat, no support...gave it up!"
I bought this for my husband and he really don't like them he's always fixing them because they fell large.
"Reviews were that the items ran small, NOT the case. I ordered sizes up and now need to return."
It's not top of the line but it's an okay shoe for the occasional outfit need. Not weather proof!!!!!!! I'm happy with it
Good for what it is. The material of this dress is kinda cheap and you can tell when you receive it. It works great for a Halloween costume or something to wear once.
The neck area is a bit tight and doesn't stretch enough.  Overall it's a good shirt but the material would be a lot better if it was softer to the skin and a bit more stretchy.
"I fell in love with these boots online but once they came in person, I was disappointed. Although they are comfortable and good quality, they come up way too high on my calfs - almost to my knees. They are also pretty bulky. The color is a little more bluish-grey than I had hoped. I wound up returning them."
"I love how warm these jeans are.  They are a little loose in the legs and they gap in the back on a curvy figure, but I've always had that problem, so not a deal breaker for me.  The three star rating is because after the second wash, the flannel on the right bottom hem started coming apart from the jeans.  I was able to do two small rolls at the bottom to hide it (I'm short, only 5'3""), but a little disappointing to happen after such a short period of time."
Well I did expect that it would fit a little better. It gets kinda loose on the sides so it kinda bunches up. I will still wear it though.
"I thought these boots were pretty cute, but they also look a bit on the cheaper side. The material doesn't seem too durable, and the boots themselves aren't super comfortable. I ended up sending them back. However, they're not expensive at all, so you get what you pay for!!"
I was really hoping these would fit well but they did not. I ordered my normal size and found the toe box to be much to tight  for comfort. They had a nice insole in them but there was not as much support as I expected. However they were super cute and I loved the gold color. I really hated to return them.
"I wanted to love these! Sadly, they fit my feet oddly; too big around ankles, strap is too tight around the toes. Color is beautiful. Not my favorite pair of Nine West shoes, but decided to keep them."
"Item is sold as being silver.... Not quite sure that I believe it, and it's not worth having it appraised."
"First one broke within 2 days, contacted mfgr and arranged for a replacement. It's an ok watch for the price: tells time reasonably accurately, but you must remember to wind it every night, or better yet, morning and at night. Stylish and sure to be a hit with any Steampunk enthusiast."
i RETURNED THEM FOR THE SIZE WAS TOO BIG FOR MY FEET DIDN'T FIT LIKE THE OTHER STYLE I HAVE
"These are great but too stiff, it doesn't get anymore comfortable, so I can only wear these for a couple of hours, and my feet start to hurt, too bad they look like they are made well."
"The chain is very nice, but the clasp was broken and loose when I received it.  I am waiting for an inter-connector which I just ordered to try to fix it.  Other than the broken clasp, it is a beautiful chain."
"This bracelet is nice but it only came on a cardboard sleeve with no details on the significance of ""Path of Life"". I was hoping for a velvet bag like other's mentioned but the price on Lightning Deal made it a good purchase anyway."
"I love the look of these boots and will keep them. They have a seam inside that is directly over the bunion on your foot and it is bad on my right foot, but fine on my left.  I have stretched the right one so it is not as bad, but still is uncomfortable, but not enough for me to not wear the boots.  They look great."
"So very comfortable, so incredibly unattractive on me. Did a half marathon in it. Worked well! Low stars due to how bad the girls looked in my victory pics!"
They are okay. They seem to slip easily on wet pavement.  I bought them for around the house only and I'm glad I got them on sale.
"I received this product earlier this week and unfortunately will have to return it.  I love the fleece lining which is super soft, but overall the quality left something to be desired.  It was rather thin; a cold blooded person like myself needs something more substantial when working outside all day.  To be fair I normally wear under armor which is more expensive and of a higher quality, so for the price I will not fault them.

The real issue I had was with the sizing. I am 5'7"" tall,  130 lbs, and normally wear a size small shirt.  Since I have longer limbs, I normally need a medium pant for the length. I was scared into getting a large by previous commenters,  which was my own stupid mistake.  The shirt was super baggy on me, which normally I would understand I'm a size small,  except the sleeves were STILL almost 2 inches too short on me.  If I had gotten a small,  it would probably be a 3/4 length shirt.  The wonky sizing is what earned it the 3 star rating."
"Material is fine, delivery was good.
I would usualy wear medium, but ordered a small for safety, but it's still too big. Disappointed."
This was on a lightning deal and its a really nice set. I love the hat and gloves. The scarf is a bit shorter than I like. I usually don't use all three pieces together- feels tacky. Mix and match. Classic Fleece set... cant go wrong here!
"the clip is to small can not hold my hair properly always, wish they used a bigger clip"
I bought these because I needed a black shoe for work. I injured my Achillies tendon playing Tennis a while back so I not only do I  need arch support but ankle stabilization as well. I think I will stick to Asics. Cute shoe though.
Beautiful dress but former fitting than all my other MC dresses.
Ordered the L/XL from reading the reviews about this dress runs too small well the the L/XL is way too big
"I was expecting a sweater knit slouch hat, this is more like an infant hat material, tshirt.  I guess it's fine just not what I expected"
"The dress is very beautiful, I ordered a 2x for my daughter, when she tried to get it on, well I am guessing it is probably about a size 12.  It is definitely not a 2x, but I hope someday somebody I know might be able to use it."
"great key chain. the metal rings feel strong and the leather band feels like it's in place to hold it together. HOWEVER, (and i must have failed to notice this) there is a small unicorn image on it and when i gave it to my husband we both chuckled. NOT what we were expecting. other than that, the key chain does what it's meant to do. hold keys. "
Funny gift but they're sort of heavy
"I'm 5'1"", 115 lbs, and usually wear an S in spanx, although I found this one to be bigger than my other pairs. I ended up returning it bc it simply wasn't tight enough. (I wear a size 2 in other pants/jeans)"
"Very nice personalized initaled handkerchiefs.  Light material, great price."
"I always keep my grandbaby in a fresh pair of New Balance because they practically go with everything!  They're comfortable and excellent quality.  Shipping was slower than I anticipated but he has other shoes, so I wasn't too disappointed.  I just know what to expect shipping wise next time.  I'm happy!"
"Nice quality, just didnt' fit like I wanted."
"I love the fitflop sandals and was hoping for the same comfort in this covered toe shoe. The strap is very comfortable, but the sole was very stiff and not as comfortable. The toe covering area was too short, putting uncomfortable pressure on my toes. I hated to return them as I had high hopes for a very comfortable shoe."
They are difficult to keep on when loosening pants to use the urinal.
sturdy.....kids don't like that i doesn't hold a form or shape.....and unzips on its own
"I like this shirt OK and it fits fine, but it's just sort of frumpy? I guess. It looks wrinkled all the time. I kept it because it was a great price, but I won't buy it again."
I ordered these shoes in the leopard in my normal size. Love the leopard but the fit is too small. The are cut a 1/2 size too small. My toes hit the top/front of the shoes. There is absolutely no room. Will be returning. It's a shame because I really wanted the leopard.
"This dress has the potential to be very flattering.  Loved the pink (melon) color.  For my body, it would need altering, however.  I have more of an hourglass shape and wear a size 12 pants/skirt and size 10 top (34 C).  The size 12 dress fit great around the hips but was way too big and baggy up top.  I didn't feel like paying extra money to have this altered when another dress I ordered fit perfect (Anne Klein matte jersey).

This product also arrived absolutely reeking of scent (like Fabreeze) and had a stain on the back.  This isn't the first time I've purchased clothing on Amazon and it seemed to be previously used.  Ugh."
"I liked the fringe collar pirate shirt costumes.
This was pretty much all they had on amazon.com.
Despite the bad reviews I purchased it.
It worked well.
It stunk and I was not certain the threads would hold up through a washing machine.
They were falling off left and right just trying it on.
I had to sweep the floor after.
But a little body sprey...and it worked for the evening.
I am saving it for a second event.
Not sure how long or many uses it will last."
"Pros
- Visually appealing; nice array of colors
- Good value
- Breathable, light material

Cons
- Product advertises an ""arch stripe for added stability""; I did not detect any added stability, feels like a regular sock
- If you're looking for heavier cushioning/support, these socks may be too thin

Overall, a decent pair of socks but would not necessarily purchase again."
Looks cheap and has a low quality fabric in person.
"This is a nice belt but after 3-5 uses it started to look old and worn out, it was a good while it lasted though."
It fits but.....I should have ordered a size bigger because I like my rash guards baggy.
So small that the design is rendered a moot effort but I have no complaints.
"If you size 1-2 up, fits well and is made well. I'm xs or s so I thought the small might fit but I needed a medium. FYI if you're going for the green color, it's more of a lime green than a Kelly green. I was expecting Kelly. Not sure if I'll keep it. Def sending back the small!!"
"This is one of those times where you make an assumption about something and it bites you. I didn't check to see if this watch had a light. It doesn't. I bought it so that I wouldn't have to lug my phone around at night checking the time while doing the pre-trip on my truck arrive/depart times and noting down the times customers request changes.
One other thing to note is that the crystal is flush with the bezel so it is a bit easier to scratch than had the bezel been raised from the crystal a few mm.
Other than that it's a good looking watch and feels reasonably constructed for the 20 USD price. Nice size on my larger than average wrist. Wife says it looks too small but I am not a fan of oversize watch faces so this is more of a traditionally sized watch."
I liked the bead but its much smaller than I thought it would be so the detail is hard to see.
The first time I ordered I ordered my shoes size. But it was too small for my feet at the toe. So I sent back the shoe and ordered a larger size. Fits great now. Has a really high heal but such a pretty shoes. I will be ordering shoes from this company in the future!
I wish this fit me correctly because it was so cute. Unfortunately the cup size was slightly smaller than it should have been. Had to return it.
Ok but no support.  More like a slipper.
"Reviews said it ran on the short side. My husband bought it for me, and it's a damn dress on me. I wear an XL, which he bought. This thing is absolutely ridiculous. I'll just be wearing it as a night dress from now on I guess."
Very pretty but fabric was too heavy. Bought it for a wedding. The cut of the dress aged me and made me feel like the mother of the bride....so I returned it.
The description says the dress fit most. The tag says size 6-8. If you don't mind the smocking stretching to the limit size 14 would be the maximum stretch.
Got these for my daughter for her long treks across her New England college campus. Unoftunatley they were way too tight in the legs. Nice looking boots though at a good price.
"Someone sat on it and it immediate just completely split in half. I'd be really careful if I wore this ring. I was quite disappointed; however, it looked really great on!"
It fit the first wear  and after it was washed as directed it shrunk.
"I wanted wool socks for their breathability and smell resistance, but these are borderline too think to be comfortable for running. More like a thick winter wool sock than a wool running sock. The fit is otherwise good, but I wouldn't buy these again."
I like the fabric and the feel of the shirt when I put it on. But it does run larger than expected.
"These are nice quality but have a pretty short rise.  I think next time i will go to a bricks and morter store and try them on, as I would not have bought them given the less than perfect fit, but it is not worth returning, so i guess i am giving it three stars.  Fabric quality and stiching is good."
Color is gorgeous.  The fitting is WAY small. Can't even wear it :(
"The body shaper was easy to put on. It felt comfortable after using it for at least 3 hours. Although I'm pretty certain I chose the correct size, the shaper really did not helped me look ""thinner"". Basically, the ""love handles"" look just a bit more even, but they don't go away, specially the ones in the back. In theory is a good design, but the fabric is too elastic to really provide the ""shaping"" you really would like to see. As always with lingerie, it is better to try it first at the store before you choose to buy it on-line."
"I liked the look and fit, but a screw loosened pretty soon after buying them."
These felt like they were a size smaller than what was listed.  I didn't keep them since I don't know how much they would stretch during the day.
They are really cute but ran large. I have 3 other pair of Toms in the same size but these were too big. One shoe was a 1/2 size larger in fit and the other just a little too big.
This wasn't as supportive as my usual DD
"I love the look of these shoes, but they were just a bit too narrow for me, and a little tight around the base of the ankle. Not the fault of the shoe, so much as my very wide feet!

These shoes be great for someone without wide feet. I have two other pairs of Everybody sandals, and they are the most comfortable that I've probably ever owned, so I highly recommend this brand."
"Ok for a cheap skirt, side seams twisted and it shrank slightly on the first wash but what you expect for the money"
Quanlity is not good.
A little baggier then i would have liked.
Not as much support as I would like but OK.
Too small and won't stay on newborn.
This product is good but the color should be better though
"I liked the style for spin class, but these shoes are narrow. I wear size 8.5 and purchased size 41. They fit in length but we're very narrow - The velcro did not fully close. These are certainly not for anyone with wide feet."
"I got this shirt for a trip to Punta Cana. It fit perfectly but while wearing it the first time, someone pointed out that the stitching had come out in the center of the back and there was an inch-wide hole where you could see my skin. I ended up taking the shirt to be altered to fix the hole but that was $8 I shouldn't have had to spend. Had I not had to mess with that, I would have rated it five stars."
"My GF is 6' and loves her boots, so I got her a pair of these to wear under her skirts/dresses to keep her warm. Ads say thigh high, but they stopped just north of her knees, so she rolled them down and wore them like boot socks. If you are over 5'6"", these may not be as long as you think. Fit and material are otherwise nice and they kept her warm."
Cute shoe but looks cheap and looks like it will wear down fast. I returned.
"I got these in a size 10 which was the biggest size they had, but they felt like a size too small! I'll probably be giving them to a friend or returning. They did look very nice though!"
"bought for my 4 year old granddaughter, they don't close properly, back strap, and she was tripping a lot, I was afraid she was going to fall. Of course, she loved them. Maybe Velcro would be better."
When I first put this on it felt small. It stretched out a little and now it feels too big. I am wondering if I should've gone down a size. I like the wide back and the material feels really satiny. The girls stay put. The problem I'm having is the side boobs.
I like the concept of this belt but I agree with other reviews in that it is too wide. It is very difficult to get this belt through the loops. Also this particular shade of tan/beige does not go well with any shade of khaki pants. The buckle does do as advertised and lays flat avoiding the bulky buckle look.
"I have mixed feelings giving this dress 3 stars, but here's my reasoning:
Cons:
1. This dress was SOOOO short on me! From the picture (and some people's answers) I guessed it would hit me about the knee. (I'm 5'6""). It was incredibly short, I could not bend over without you-know-what happening. The short skirt also makes the dress totally different proportionally to the picture. It's like for the bigger sizes they don't make it longer, they just stretch it wider.
2. The sash on this was terrible! It was cut on a weird bias, and there was a diagonal seam that was not even at the half way point. It was very poorly made.

Pros:
1. The bodice part was well made and comfortable.
2. The sizing was accurate.
3. I ended up buying this dress in the floor-length version and just hemmed it to the appropriate length, and the longer dress had a much better quality sash on it."
They are nice... until you wash them. They wrinkle soooo bad.
"they are really beautiful, boots i just got wrong size"
"The shirt fits well, but the pants seem small.  Pants are very thin too."
"Had to order 2 sizes larger in this dress.  The arms are way too small and cut in under the armpit. Cute dress, once I got the size right, but just know to order bigger for this dress."
Thought this was made out of actual tie dyed fabric....turns out it's just printed on.  It's still cute but looks a little cheap up close.
"The purse is really nice, but unfortunately it was too small for me.  I returned it already.  But if someone doesn't need a large purse, they might really like this purse.  It just didn't work for me personally."
"It did the job for link removal, but two of the pins bent as soon as the included hammer hit them.  The jaxa wrench is not big enough for Invicta watches. It was worth the price it saved me had I went to a Jewler to resize the watch I bought if for,"
"The product is cute and soft not sure how it will hold up through the washer even on delicate. When on my son it fits like a mushroom doesn't pull down snugly , ears are hot glued on and so is the tail for the price I do not regret buying it but I would not purchase again mainly because of how it fits"
"Okay, extremely lightweight!"
Seemed to run small.  I'm a size 12 and it felt tight.
"These are very cute shoes, but I disagree with the other reviewers.  They were too narrow for me and I thought they fit pretty true to size.  I did purchase the Medium width, probably should have gone with the wide.  Nice soft suede, just didn't work for my foot."
"Its not a bad purchase for the price, and I like the insignia on the front. Im not too concerned about anyone knowing its a passport by the marking because theives already assume you have a passport on you during transit. There is plenty of space to hold my cards and my cash. However, I didn't like how hard it is to get my passport in and out of the slot. This take up a little bit of time which seems like a lot when trying to get through customs. Also, the cover does not stay closed so I have to keep a rubber band around it at all times."
The ring runs small. I normally wear a size 7 but this is a bit too tight. Otherwise really like the ring.
I weigh 110lbs and it pulls up in me constantly.
"Nice shoes, but they were too big.  I normally wear a 9 wide and that is what these were, but they slipped off my feet with every step.  I think it just the design of this shoe because I have a different pair of Clark's that size and they fit perfect and are so comfortable."
"The shirt looks great after it is washed and dried in the dryer, but it does shrink a little."
"This is okay. It's kind of an awkward length. It'd be great for a Kentucky Derby event, though. Just add a hat. The waist is a little weird. I wish I was more descriptive. I've only worn it once and bought it months ago. If I didn't get such a deal I would have sent it back."
Pants a little tight
"The height of the heel was not quite high enough for the outfit.  The shoes were comfortable, cute, and priced right !"
very disappointed in the fit
"These shoes are incredibly beautiful, and I absolutely love them.  They are incredibly uncomfortable, but man do they look great!"
Very odd. Looks like you are wearing something inside out
"They are really nice socks, thick, comfy, and with good non-slip treads. I bought the LARGE for my husband as no XL was offered. Admittedly he wears 13 shoes and Large only fits up to 12.5.  But they were much too small.

Who ended up taking them and loving them? ME, his 5'1"" size 8 wife! They are a little big but honestly not by much.

You will love them if you buy up by 1-2 sizes."
Good quality but obviously not real leather.  Heavier than expected
Hubby wears size 13; ordered 47 and it is narrow in the toe.  Will have to get them stretched.
These fit great and are inexpensive.  They only seem to last a few months though.  I've blown through 5 pair in a year.
"I ordered the white color, it totally see through."
"For about ten washes, these are great socks.  Sometime after that they begin to stretch out.  Since my feet did not change length, the socks are now too big.  I feel like crying!  I'm meticulous about my socks, never wear them without footwear so they don't get soiled, wash them in a protective bag to keep them together, and so I don't have to use bleach that you know damages fabric like this.  I hang them to dry.  So they shouldn't have stretched out.  When they're new, they're exactly the perfect socks for all but the coldest months.  When they're stretched out, maybe they can be passed down to an adult son. Haha.  This review written by the Mrs."
"If used as a first layer, it's very good.  I dinged it a couple stars because the weather I used it in was at a football game in the low 40s.  The breeze was very slight and I wore a cap over it and I felt a tinge of cool. The other ding is that my ears hurt from being bent I guess.  Odd I didn't realize they were bent.  My neck was nice and toasty and that was huge. I'll try it again next year but I'll wear a stocking cap over it."
"Cute but felt a little bit too tight on my 17 1/2"" wide calf.  Had to return."
"The sole is very comfortable, but the lining is very harsh and I got blisters on my heel/ankle the first day wearing them. Idk if I can wear them again."
The sizing disappointed me. Made for people with wide feet
"I ordered a bigger size thinking it would be a little ""flowy"", but it wasn't."
Shoe is alright. I was disappointed that they started coming apart after the second hike. I won't be ordering this brand again.
Bonitas pero pequeas!
These fit well at first but shrink more with every wash.  Need to be line dried apparently.
Cute but runs really small. Made a good gift!
"I really like the style of this thing, very cool in that respect. Its is really thin and should not be washed in a machine or it will fray and tatter faster then normal. Traditional Shemagh's are much thicker, but that not what this is. It is a fashion item and it works as such, its cheap and I will by another if I cannot find anything of higher quality online."
"Looks great! Unfortunately, one of the stones fell out from the end - still wearable since that part is in between the fingers, but wish it was more durable. Everything else is perfect! Fit, style."
"Love the leather and the wolf art design is great. Only complaint is the snap on the back is not as sturdy and reliable as I would have liked, so I don't wear it as often as I'd like for fear of losing it. But it's a handsome piece. If you just plan to wear this occasionally and not all the time, you will be very happy with your purchase. Everyone who ""has a thing for wolves"" will enjoy this piece."
Great looking purse. Looks really expensive. Shortly after I had it threads started to pull out. and it became unusable.
"I liked the idea of these shoes.  They look great in pictures, but they run extremely small.  Also, after only a few wears, the patent leather peels off."
I sent it back because of the size but definitely a cute blouse; thin but can wear with camisole or dark color bra
But nice I will put them in the dryer.
Material is not really high quality. Cute pattern and fits well. Shorts are really short though.
"I believe I purchased an xxxl, fits more like a med/large, was much much shorter than expected, im 5'2 and comes to about just under my knee. I wear a size 36D (if you're any larger this will not fit over your chest, it hardly does mine), but the quality is good, and would probably be better for someone smaller!,"
"I was disappointed when this bra came in. It did not fit me well at all. I bought the size that I normally buy, a C cup, and the cups were really big with lots of room. It seemed like it would have been comfortable had it fit. I suggest going a cup smaller if you are going to purchase this bra."
The gloves aren't long enough and the cat suit is short sleeve. It's weird. The suit fits great just weird short sleeves.
One of the earrings has a big white spot on it. Making it look as if the earrings were painted.
"I just received my hat and i love the fit, quality and the way it slouches but the color is so awfully purple / pink  - ""spilled redwine on a white carpet a few years ago red"" - i might have to return or exchange for another color. Awful color..... bad......"
I bought this tank in the exact same size as another similar style one from same brand. It is significantly smaller and shorter.
"Not bad shoes, but the size isn't quite right for me.  I put padded insoles in them, and they're okay."
"I bought this dress to give to my cousin as a little gift. It comes just as pictured in terms of details and the vibrant blue color. It also runs very true to size. However, the stitching in the back came already ripped. As if someone bought it and returned the item. There was a 2 inch hole that ran along the seam of the buttocks area. I wasn't about to waste my time returning a 30 something dollar dress. Instead, I wanted to donate it but my cousin is a bit of a sport and decided to keep it and take it to a seamstress to fix. I won't purchase from this seller again since they lack quality control."
nice but a bit large
leggings were short
"Fit well and comfy material. After first wearing, seam under crotch began to split. I'm a terrible sewer (sooner, not sue-er) so I did not like that problem."
Bought for hubby. He likes them ok; said the waistband is pretty comfy.
I should have order a bigger size. They run a little tight
I usually wear a 2XL but bought a size larger. I am glad I did because it fits good. I wanted it to be a little blousier though. I will wear it.
Fits nice but no stretch. Length is good
"Somewhat large, but cute top"
Lost its shape in a couple of days. I do not think it was worth it.
"I order a medium. The size was perfect but the length, I thought was way too short. For me it comes way over my bellybutton. I thought maybe the stitching of It could be a little better, my shirt came with tons of strings. But I love it! Also the necklace is very cute."
"Somewhat thinner cotton than expected...but, they work.  Probably just buy in the store next time."
Returned these. They were thin fabric and didn't fit like my older pairs of NYDJ.  This pair seemed tight in the wrong places.
ok for houseshoes but they don't thrill me.
HUGE OMG
"These boots are really cute. I wasn't worried about the smell that other reviewers mentioned, but sitting in my office all day it is almost giving me a headache... My coworker came in and asked if I smelled a gas leak! So if you are getting these, I would plan on letting them air out a couple days prior to wearing, or wearing outside and not to the office! Other than that, the color of was true to the picture."
size was incorrect
These sandals are really cute but not comfortable. I have a really narrow foot but these were even more narrow than my foot. I could only wear them for an hour and then I had to kick them off and change to a flat.
"The shirt is cute, but a hole ripped where the tag is the very first day I wore it."
Comfy but a tad too small. I wear an 8 and my heel is over the edge. Returned for large.
I always thought TH was a good brand.  My husbands wallet started falling apart very quickly.  Pretty disappointed with the quality.
Nice looking suit but runs small.
"I like the sweatshirts.  Ordered two, but they run very small.  Not true to size.  The material is very thin with my bra visible through material.  ""May"" be because it's too small.  Also, the zipper on the 2nd one puckers and pokes out.  Because of that, the fabric over the zipper won't lay flat.  For the price, I still like them."
"Definitely worth the sale price of 3 for 16.99.  Not worth much more.  The straps are skinny and only two hooks in the back.  Kinda comfy, though."
"Comfortable, good construction."
*** I normally wear size 8 --- my heel hangs over the back of the shoe...not sure what i'll do yet...
"Even though the shoes are my size, it is so hard to get in and out of them.  I expected more comfort from a
Sketcher shoe; I love Sketchers.  I probably; own at least 25 pairs, but this pair fell short of my expectation for Sketchers."
I have no idea why I bought this. but they're CUTE!
It was a bit tight around the shoulders and chest.  I'd go up a size next time.
"I've owned this product in several sizes.  When my son was a baby this product was awesome.  It was easy to get on, lay him down slide up one leg and snap it on the other size.  It was equally as easy to get off too, the snap side was a lifesaver with a little something special was inside!  Lets fast forward to toddler years, the snaps that I loved when he was a baby I now loath.  My son is almost 3 and potty trained, but the YMCA where we swim requires swim diapers until 4.  I'm totally fine with that, a lot of kids these days aren't trained until after 3 and even when they are trained, young kids have accidents...lets face it, poop happens.  Anyways I bought these to go under his new Lightning McQueen trunks (he's a Cars fanatic), but they aren't worth it.  For starters getting them on him is a pain.  I'd like to pull them up like underwear, but I can't because the snaps start coming undone.  Then once they are on, he starts wiggling like a toddler and the snaps start coming undone again.  I've laid mine aside and went back to his i-play trunks that have the diaper built in...much easier.

My recommendation is this:  If you have a young baby these are awesome, but if you have an older baby (that is walking) or a toddler who is potty training or trained (as the case at your pool may be) then get the I-play diapers without snaps."
The material is thin and probably won't last long.
"They are a tad smaller than expected. I do not like the feel of them and they are not comfortable to walk in. A bigger size might or might not have alleviated the odd-feeling places in the shoe, but it would not have changed the interior texture. Returned them."
they were not what I expected
The sleeves are too short after washing. I prefer the Columbia Men's Bahama II Long Sleeve Shirt
not all the same size
"My daughter really loves these watches, and I say that in plural.  We have now gone through 2 of them.  The first time was sort of her fault, she wore it in the shower for a minute, these watches are definitely not water resistant, and the water warped the inside face.  then the band broke in a separate incident.  So was she too hard on the watch?  The jury is still out on that one.  Then, as a surprise, because she really loved the watch, I bought her another one.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and she was just walking along at a store with me and it fell of, but we had all the parts.  It was the pin that goes between the watch and the band.  Overall I give the cuteness of the watch a 5 for girls that are pre-teen.  The quality is about a 2, it does keep time but is obviously cheaply made.  I give the band a 3, it breaks easily, it is rubber and looks cool and comfortable, so it does get an ok grading.  I think this is a watch you would be taking your chances on but you can usually get it for under $20.  With that being said, if you want quality you can find better quality for maybe double the price if you look for some other watches."
"Great try!  But the tri-fold needs more fold space to allow for the number of credit card pockets in this wallet!  When all the pockets are used, the wallet does not close."
Just wish it was a little longer in the front. I have a DDD size chest and mine does not come down as low as the model pictured.
"Overall great however after 2 uses, the sides don't completely stay down.  Works well for clothing items that are not skin tight."
"The thing I cant stand about them is the back pockets. Everything you put back there is loosey goosy. Keys, wallet, whatever just constantly shift around. An internal back pocket like on men's Propper would be useful."
"Items such as driver's license, auto insurance cards, & $, can be a challenge to put into this wallet.  Once you manage to put items inside,
it works okay."
Way too long and writing on shirt makes no sense. Prob. will not wear.
"They were more baggy than I would had liked them, but for the money they are ok, and I really like Dickie's products"
"Initially, I liked it.  It was relatively loose , and only wore it twice.  On the second try, when I tightened the laces, one of the plastic boning strips popped out of the corset, making it unusable.  This happened two days after the return window closed.  I am writing the manufacturer to request an exchange, as this is clearly a quality control issue.  If customer service is offered, I'll change my review.

Update to 3 stars:  Customer service was very nice and refunded me without having to return the item!  I will try to get a seamstress to repair it and see how it works."
Returned them after being disappointed trying them on. They are like Keds. Weird shaped Keds that run small. No thanks.
"Disappointed it looked better in the picture, looks cheap because the beads are very small and look pretty lackluster."
"Very cute shirt but 4T runs too small, even for my 10th percentile sized daughter. Must return it"
"Definitely more of a ""construction"" style boot rather than ""combat/fashion."" The photo was a little deceiving as the toe is bulbous and rounded and not low-profile as expected. The leather is beautifully raw and allows for custom patina to be built up over time."
"I am a little disappointed in how it fits. It is on the smaller side, compared to motherhood brand sleep bras. I do like how thick it is though, nice for around the house without showing through."
"I researched, waited, asked questions, received answers, and finally settled on this watch after almost a year of searching. I was so excited! It was a birthday present for my husband (who has taste, but doesn't always exercise it). I knew the style I wanted, and this fit the bill.
I had purchased a different one first but within 3 weeks, the black band started to rub off- revealing the brass color underneath. So I returned it and got this one... after asking if it would rub off and received multiple ""no""s. Welp, it did. It took about 8 wks, which was longer than the other one, but still! For almost $300 it shouldn't tarnish/rub off AT ALL. That's my biggest complaint (which is a big deal).

PROS:
1) It is heavy... Like, you could seriously hurt someone with this thing. This makes me think it's durable.
2) The style- omigosh I love skeleton watches. My 33 yr old husband has an old soul so I knew he would love this. I was right.
3) Self-winding. Sure, he has to wind it sometimes if he's been sedentary for too long (he's at a desk 90% of the work day), but that's only been- at most-  2 to 3 times a week.
4) it's ""man"" sized. He appreciates the watch face-to-wrist ratio.

CONS:
1) The black wore off- revealing a silvery color underneath. Mind you, he only wears it to work and special occasions. An 8 week rub off is ridiculous.
2) The Fossil name is written quite bodily across the top of the face. I get it, you want to show your name, but good grief, must you make it so flashy?? The one we received was in a shiny blue color. Not silver like the picture. Regardless, I'd prefer a smaller print.

So there you go. Bottom line, definitely not worth $300. I don't see much purpose in buying a fancy, unique-style watch like this if the color is just going to wear off. I don't walk around with half-chipped painted nails...
We'll likely be returning it.  Booooooo on you, Fossil."
"These were cute and I loved the colors, but I expected a cushier ride. They seemed a little stiff for my needs, so I was unable to keep them for working out and running.  They also ran small. The 7.5 fit my size 7 foot ok, and would be perfect if i only intended to wear them casually.  Had I kept them for running, I'd have needed an 8 at least ( I have a wide forefoot and narrow heel). I wish I could justify hanging onto them for all around wear though!"
Length and width are good  but they design is made to cut at you ankles.  Not good for long hikes.  Poor design on support
"If your calf muscles are a bit bigger than most womens than these boots aren't for you! I have bigger calves and it felt like these boots were cutting of my cerculation to my feet! you cant adjust them to loosen them, the buckles are just for show..Other than that its a nice boot..I just wish they would have fit better..Gonna send in and get a different pair, which I hate because I loved the way these looked!"
Felt much cheaper than most Alex and Ani braclets that I have bought in stores.
Uncomfortable but will wear because I have no other shoes.  BOO
"odd color, runs a little small"
I wish the waistband stretched better. Also expect this to take VERY long shipping. Do not order if you need it before 10 weeks. Color is very vibrant. This worked quite well under my red dress for Halloween and a classy black and red dress for my company's Christmas Party.
"I loved these boots when they arrived at my door. These are advertised as wide calf boots and were bought due to my larger than ""normal"" calves. I noticed the first time I put these on that they were a little tight on my upper part of my calf but otherwise fit nicely on my feet. I bought a size in these boots that I would normally buy for shoes. However, after a few wears with pulling the zipper up, the zipper tab broke in half! It was an ""easy"" fix with a zip time and no one really sees the inner part of the boot but it still left me a bit bummed.

They are comfortable to wear and can easily be worn for an entire day or evening out since the heel is low enough. I would recommend to others but buyer beware if you have plumpier calves!"
"I GOT THESE FOR AN IRRESISTIBLY LOW PRICE, AND WAS EXCITED BY THE REVIEWS, THE BRAND, THE STRETCH. BUT THE JEANS -- SIZE 4, LOW RISE -- ARE ENORMOUS. I LIKE A WIDE LEG, BUT THESE ARE WIDE IN THE HIP AND THIGH, INCHES OF LOOSE MATERIAL. I AM A PETITE PERSON, BUT SIZE 4 JEANS USUALLY FIT. NOT THESE. I TRIED TO BELT THEM UP, BUT THEY LOOK RIDICULOUS. SO BE FOREWARNED: THESE RUN BIG, IN MY ESTIMATION. I CAN'T STAND THE HASSLE OF RETURNING, SO I WILL WEAR THEM IN THE GARDEN. AND HOPE THEY DONT FALL OFF."
"Chest portion a bit too snug, but rest fits fine"
Not the best umbrella ever but it is cute. The issue I have is when you go to put it up the ends of the umbrella have to be pulled down. (They fold upward when you colapse the umbrella) with the black lining it makes it super stiff. I have to pull really hard to get it to click into place. I also could never hey the umbrella small enough to get it back in the sleeve.
Instructions for operation really not good. But looks ok.
Fit was okay but it was much shorter than it looks in picture.
"well i thought it would be a lot more orange like whats shown in the picture, but oh well its really warm which is the whole point."
"I've had this backpack for just over a year now. I use it about every day for work. One of the two top zipper's doesn't work and one of the teeth is crooked and jams the zipper from closing all the way. As others have said, the front pouches never stay closed so you need to be careful or things can fall out. I get lots of compliments on how attractive and masculine it is which it very much is. I would not buy it again because of the zippers. I don't know why they don't switch to a nylon type of zipper, these just aren't made to be opened and closed every day I guess. I read the reviews about the zippers before my purchase so I have been very careful to not try to jam or abuse the pack which is why it still looks like new after a year of use. Unfortunately, the zipper issue is not something that is tolerable. Also, I don't know why they couldn't use snaps or velcro to hold the pockets shut. The leather is a thick quality and otherwise wears well."
Somewhat too large and too loose
Ok but not what I expected.  Not worth the purchase. Don't recommend.
"The product looks very good, and the fabric feels good. However, the fabric has an irritating way of rolling up tightly at the hems during wear."
"Smaller and less comfortable than the previous design. It's narrower, less depth, and shorter in length which is really frustrating. I feel like I'm going to slip in these. Cushioning is nice as usual."
"Wont stay on a hanger so I clipped to the hanger with wood clothes pins. This changed the color  of the shirt like it was bleach.....I am sure it's because the wood oxidized, but still......"
"Although I liked the look of the shoe, the 9W is not wide.  My toes would not even start to go in."
"I ordered newborn size but received 0-3.
My baby is still too small for these but I'm sure they'll be fine once she fits in them. I only bought them because we really needed newborn size. I find the style and colors to be tacky, but this is represented fairly in the photos."
"It is a nice and pretty watch, but I don't like how the glass bulges out a bit. It makes me nervous about getting scratches easily. I returned it."
The quality seems fine but the sweTer is huge.
Socks are  well made and value priced
"Just ok too short though, I love my Lounge Pants long. I am 5'8 175lbs."
My daughter did not like the straps.  She said they felt uncomfortable.  We did not keep this romper.  Fits true to size.
"Scratches VERY EASILY!!!  Wanted to return for a different size, but it scratched the first time my husband wore it!"
"I am a B cup, the top was huge on me. Other than that, I think it's  a cute suit. Too bad they don't sell the pieces separately.  This would be great if you are well-endowed."
It is short in length.  So looks a little funny.  Good for wearing around the house.
"Material is very good, but fits on the tighter and small side."
It's not that warm when you are out all day. It fit perfect and it didn't slip in the snow.
It's good quality but if you are normally 42dd this is still too small for you esp when you're breastfeeding. Returning unfortunately
The V cutout it too long down the chest.  It looks odd compared to other V neck T's
Kinda cheaply made and the zipper broke first day.  I have a seamstress fixing it.
I loved the dress but I had to send it back.  It was to big on top but fit great in the waist.  If it was an easy fix and would have had it fixed on top.
I had these for one winter and they were regularly getting wet.  My feet managed to stay fairly dry but the constant wet/drying out caused the glue to separate at the toe box.
Material need to be softer.
"Nice shirt, but it seems like its 2 sizes too large."
As described but not as pictured. It is short and the butterflies are not as large as shown.
Sleeves are a bit larger than expected and material is a little tough. Overall not bad.
The short is cool but it  is Too small  for  I think it is like a 32 waist good day
"The cut and style of the skirt was great! I thought it would be a darker navy color though, so I had to return it. It is more of a deep blue/indigo color than navy."
"They are so tight, but that just might be the style. I have bought a different style of jeans from this same brand and fell in love with them, so while this cut might not be for me, it's not a bad product."
"Must admit i was a bit disappointed when i recieved this capri, i am a big fan of under-armour products and always pleased with all my UA purchases, i have lots of UA T-shirts and pants that take a good beating at the gym and they hold strong, always value for money. Until i got this capri, first the quality of the product, i purchased the black but it looks like a washed out black/grey pants, don't get me wrong it is not bad but not what i am accostomed to from UA (especially for the price, the material feels cheap) I usually wear medium, which is the size i ordered, but it fits more like a large, however it is loose and very comfortable,and will be ideal for lounging at home."
"Super sexy - made me feel like a bada*s as soon as I put them on! Unfortunately. the calf runs too tight to wear over jeans or even socks! They did come with a weird chemical smell that is mentioned in another review. If these fit over jeans, I would have kept them instead of returning due to size."
The gloves are very warm and comfortable and I love the deer print. However the picture shows the gloves as black but when I received them the fingers had light grey colored finger tips. I think it looks odd to have a different color just at the tips.
"I really like this romper, in fact, its the first one I've ever purchased. I love the pockets on the side for a more casual feel. I am pretty short and was afraid this was going to drag under my feet but it fits perfectly and stops right at my ankles. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
These fit great in the length department and around the waist but my Dont kept tripping because there is no range of motion in the legs. He's 18 months 32 ilbs and tall
"The style, stitching, size and the color is good BUT the leather does not look of the good quality as it is described. The key for the lock looks cheap.
I wish they use a better quality leather for this style.  Even it it will be more expensive to make,  the bag would look a lot better and not cheap. This is a French style bag that I know it very well. I can see the difference here.
Thank you."
"The color of these shoes is gorgeous and Frye fits me perfectly.  I just wasn't expecting for my feet to look so long in them. I also worried about how they would look at the natural crease that will eventually appear at the toe bend after extended wear.  I kept thinking if my feet look long now, that crease will accentuate it.  I hated to return them, but I did. Hopefully Frye will have another modern style I'll look nice in."
"I am thankful to have found a pair of boots that are comfortable and didn't need a lot of breaking in.  With the sketchers name, I was hoping for better quality though.  I can wear these all day and no blisters at all and they are super cute.  Unfortunatly the color wears off easily of the toes.  They aren't leather so the wearing doesn't look right.  Just cheap.  I'm hoping to find the righ color sharpie to extend the life of my boots because they really are comfortable!"
"Very small, it fit my granddaughter perfectly and she wears an extra small.  I cut the little strings they called straps off and am using it as a scarf.  The material is nice and silky soft."
Really cute style but too tight in the arms for anything more than a thin t-shirt.
Don't like the material but the dress is cute.  Will be fine for playtime.
"This bag is just okay- not as nice as I thought it would be.  It is serviceable, I guess."
"have not really worn as of yet, but look nice"
ok not for me
"Pros: Nice design. comfy. Soft
Cons: Not enough support, the heel keeps dangerously sliding left and right. With better heel cup and support in the back these would be  wonderful shoes"
"This top is very thin, not to be worn by itself, for you will be able to see through it.  Light fabric though,, I intend to wear it over workout clothes."
They are OK but not great. Will not return but will not recommend.
Nice boots but my girl has big calfs
"It is cute, but it's rather straight.  it is too tight around the bust and hips, but I I were to sixe up, it would be too large in the waist.

Will be giving this to my less curvy sister."
"Nice shirt, size was perfect however after wearing it 3 times one of the seams in the sleeve came loose and now I have a hole."
"Nice shorts, but a little on the heavy side."
A litter larger than expected.
"I ordered these, and received them just as the weather turned warm.  Put them away and just recently took them out and realized I received a pair of Karen Kane pants instead!  Wore them but assume too late to send back!  Cannot vouch for these pants as a result."
"This purse is OK, but not what I thought I was ordering.  It was written up to be Navy Blue.  It is not Navy Blue,  It is blue - - - a dull, lighter than what I consider Navy Blue purse.  It's OK to carry to work when I wear my jeans, but definitely not dressy.  I was disappointed when I received it, because I have been looking for a true Navy Blue purse for the last few years.  They sell Navy Blue shoes, but no Navy Blue purses to be had."
Nice boot but my daughter was very disappointed with the fit....actually will be a return.
Ok but small
"Sizing is off,  fits about a size too small"
This was not what I expected. The material from which this is made is not very good in my opinion. One of them is already torn.
I order these shoes in a 1/2 larger than my size.  Unfortunately they run small.  But I decided to keep them.
cheap;y made
"The boots look great, my feet fit comfortably and have a great quality like most of Me Too shoes. However, the boots come up right at my knee caps. So they're not for the petite height. If the boot shaft was a couple inches shorter, then I'd keep them. Unfortunately, I had to return these."
Sandals you could wear for hours but not all day walking.
"I bought these based on the glowing reviews. They are not soft, in fact, they're a little scratchy. The fit is too clingy for my tastes.  I'm 5 feet tall, 110 pounds, and I ordered a medium. They are just not what I was hoping for."
This shirt is very boxy. Meaning it's very wide and does not fit the body at all. The quality of the shirt was the cheapest I've had. The text on the shirt is not as cute in person. Looks much better in picture. I would post picture but threw it away.
My daughter can't quite wear this yet cause it was not quite fit to size.  the material is cheap but it will work as an extra layer for sports.
I found that thes fit just a little tight I have worn them in the snow to break them in and have worn them all winter in Mn. but they are still a little tight.
"My daughter didn't like it so we bought another one, you get what you pay for, it does look a bit cheap."
"The pants are very nice and soft, although I would have thought plus size would be stretchier maybe? I'm 5'4 175 and these leggings fit pretty well although, if I were much bigger I don't think I would personally like them. The black pairs seem to fit better and more comfortably than the other 3 for some reason. The gray and blue pairs like to slide down at the crotch area which is not flattering. The brown pair already junk after just a few wears. So I have a love hate relationship with them. They are great for under jeans to keep you extra warm, great for lounging around home and they look really cute with the plaid tops that I am obsessed with. Mixed feelings but for the price, I will likely buy another batch next fall."
They are a bit smaller than I needed
"Beautiful high quality bag! I love the dual straps to be worn as a shoulder bag or cross body. Unfortunately this arrived and was much bigger than I anticipated. If I could find this bag in a slightly smaller version and a fun color, I would be sold."
"Color of the stones looked like cheap imitation and not real sapphires, created or natural. You get what you pay for."
The dress of the costume is fine. What you would expect from an inexpensive costume. It states on the bag it fix up to dress sixe 12 but I think it would probably fit up to 14 or so.  The main issue is the wig. It is really small. If I pulled it back to cover the back of my head the top was about an inch past my hairline. Totally unusable.  The belt is cheap plastic but it serves it's purpose.  I did not use the boot covers and just wore regular shoes.
These are just ok. After a while they made my feet hurt. I would not wear them past 4hours.
Fit as expected but I wish the material is more thicker
Very nice but large
"While the material and style are flattering, I highly recommend you think twice before purchasing the dress in case it doesn't fit correctly (runs small in my my opinion) as they have a tedious return policy."
"I got a medium to try. A nice dress for a dresser night out or a company Christmas party. A well made dress with good fabric materials. Not see through and surprisingly light-weight. The bell sleeves are cute. I am 5'4"". The sleeves covered my hands and the dress stopped right above my knees. This was nice as I hate when dresses that are meant to be shorter are longer on me. It cuts off my length and makes me look shorter. However, this dress really had no shape. I would suggest dressing it up with a nice long necklace or a belt to give it more body and to keep it from being just a simple black dress."
"Two strikes against these and they are both my fault for not paying attention.  1) Sterling silver...tarnishes.  They tarnished in ~3 days.  So, now they are not shiny and new but dark gray.   2) They are large for my ears.  I think 5-6 mm would be about the biggest that would work without being so obvious.  Other than that, the $$ was right!"
I like the bracelet but it broke within the first week of wearing it.  Don't think I'd buy again unless they make it a little more sturdy.
"Not as long as I wanted, but once I loosened the laces and got my sister to help pull it together it fit- more of a dominatrix top than I had wanted, but good quality material."
A bit tight by the toe area
The eyes fell of in a few minutes.
"I love this wallet!! For many reasons... it has a cut out in the ID part to easily get out an plenty of credit card slots, great size change holder and I love that it has a bit extra room to slip my phone an chapstick in with it, so I have everything with me in one compact wallet! I have 3 stars however because the wristlet frayed An is now hanging by a string (literally). It's a thick string that has held on for a year but it looks bad. Also, the snap to close it can be a little difficult at times."
"This is a heavy weight shirt,but after wearing ince and washing twice the collar curled and was all stretched out."
They are nice shoes but they are not brown... They are kind of a dark oxblood.
these are made about half a size too small but so are Merrell's shoes
pretty cheap but they do work. No one is all down on the ground looing at your feet anyway. Hope they don't break...
"I would love to give a full 5 stars but my stones weren't pure. The clear ones had a little purple in them and my other ones had different shades too, I was really disappointed. Also, the edge of the wires seem to get hung up on ever shirt I own!"
"I like the look on the upper, and I love the leather interior.  My only concern is that they may not stretch into my foot shape.  Brand new, they are a little snug for a size 8.  My heel is over the back edge when I first put them on.  Love the look tho.  I'll wear them, just not for a long walk."
"Fits more like a jacket than a traditional rashguard.  It's roomy in width in the torso, even though the arms are tight.  I also wish the arms were a little shorter in length.  What I really miss though is a pocket.  If this had a pocket, it would be perfect.  Why would you need a pocket if you're swimming?  For locker keys, or a credit card, or even your phone.  Other rashguards have pockets so it's not such a crazy idea."
"Shoe seems supportive and OK, but about a half to a full size larger than marked."
It is fair quality .
These garnet earrings are very dark and almost look black instead of the deep red color they should be.
"I was disappointed with this shirt: it is a Chinese ripoff of poorish quality.  The edges of the letters were fuzzy, and the guitar on the back, was NOT on the back.  It was a gift for someone we were visiting and it took a long time to come- got it just before we left, so brought it anyway.  But we were very disappointed in the quality."
"not that this is great, mind you.  They are wide and extremely flat in the arches.  So if you wear them for more than an hour or two - be prepared for very tired feet.  I would think that more support would be warranted in a trail shoe, but as these are the best that I tried, and I tried a lot, apparently this isn't a desired trait in a trail shoe.  I thought that odd.

I guess I need to get some orthotics for these.

If you don't need arch support - you will love these."
"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and while he normally wears an x-large I had read enough of the reviews to know that this particular shirt runs big. I ordered him a large but even that was too big. I returned it and ordered a medium and he is going to keep it but it is still a little long in the arms. He is delighted to be in a Medium for the first time in about 20 years :) but I think it would be helpful to know to order 2 sizes below what you normally wear.
Besides that it is a nice heavyweight shirt at a very reasonable price."
"Sort of strange cushioning pattern!  Love darn tough but when I ordered these I thought I was getting a medium cushion (I looked on their site first and these are under the category medium cushion).  The color is great (got the light blue stripe) but there is only cushioning on the bottom of the foot and then a band around the lower calf - otherwise the top of the foot is thin and also above and below the band.  I was really looking for the full cushion I now realize, which now since I wore these, I will buy those.  So still love darn tough but just want others to know what they are getting.  Probably good for hiking, etc., in medium not cold weather."
vey shiny fabric; smallish waistband. Would not buy again.
"They are cute and comfortable - for a while but toward the end of the day, my feet were hurting.  Maybe there is a break-in period needed."
Did not shrink as much as I am used too
"The title says it all.  I have bought two of these same ties just in two different colors and they are two completely different sizes.  They are both ""skinny"" ties but the gold/brown one is much wider than the silver/black one....the silver/black one is just a straight line and doesn't get any wider towards the bottom whereas the other one does.  Seems odd that the exact same brand of tie wouldn't be the same width."
beautiful but too narrow
After 6 weeks of wearing at work the soul of the boots are 60% worn out
"The reason why I didn't give this 3 piece set 5 stars, was due to the fact that the fabric was alot scratchier than I had expected. My boyfriend wanted to rub his hands all over me, but the scratchy fabric didn't make it as enjoyable. I'm 5'4, 130lbs, and a 34D. Everything fit, though the cincher was a bit tight and the top edges of it had a tendency to roll down. It helped when I had the garter straps actually hooked on to something. When I first got it, I didn't feel like it was that sexy, but I ordered the Open Crotch Lace Boyshort With Ruffle Back in Black by Seven Til' Midnight, and Leg Avenue Women's Lace Top Fishnet Stockings #9027 in black. They made a big difference in how the whole outfit looked and I was pleased. Last night when I wore everything together with my make up and hair done, I looked hot. Don't get this product if you're any bigger than me, or if you want something to move around in. I ended up getting frustrated with the cincher and took it off. My boyfriend liked the way I looked, but I think he would've preferred something softer."
Product runs super small
fit just a little small around my penis area.
I think I will stick to going to the store and trying things on
"I am a regular MapOfBeauty customer, as always I was very pleased with the short delivery time and the color of the wig I received. However, this wig tangled worse than any long wig I've ever had. I had to wash it for any hope of detangling it and even then I lost more than half the fibers in the process. If you are cosplaying Nozomi I recommend springing for something prestyled."
Loved the bra-panties way to big.
"Love it. Support is good. Drawback - not lasting. wore it twice for a few hours and it has started  to strip.

2 years later - still holding up. jus minor repairs needed. no regrets. best shoes for everyday work wear."
"it fits right, but I got the wrong color eyeball... I ordered green and got blue.  It's from china so I'm not sending it back.  just be aware they might send you the wrong ring."
Cute outfit but the seam at the feet started to come apart and my baby didn't wear this often at all and only for sleep so the quality of construction may be questionable
"I had never had foam shoes, gave them a try based off of reviews, generally speaking Sketchers is all I wear but I am not overly fond of these shoes for the gym.... still wear them though :)"
Nice light fabric but dress was very large.
"This is such a well made, pretry little dress especially for the price however it runs very short.  I would say the 24 month size is actually compared to a 12-18 month.  My toddler is 23 lbs. @  21 months, average  height with a thinner frame.  Was disappointed because I really loved it."
it is fit well but a lot of thread head
"I bought this shoe because I read that barefoot running gives you a more proper form. I am someone who suffers from back problems and barefoot shoes are definitely a no no when it comes to that. I'm sure these are great if you have no problems with shin splints, back pain, knee pain, but if you do, try a Merrell with more support."
"Better of several slippers I ordered.  Much better than the Isotoner.  Not as nice as 10 year old pair of Rockports.

Sturdy and thick soles.  Medium thick, medium cushy padding.  Good deal at $6.  The old Rockports, the best slippers I ever had, were like running shoes in thickness and cushyness of the padding.  Newer Rockports about like these Dockers.

I had to return.  I'm a 9.5 in slippers.  The only sizes that are close are M and L.  M was too small and L too big.  They are listed as 8 and 9.5 respectively but I would say they are 9 and 10.5 actually.  One size bigger than stated.

They are completely synthetic."
let me start by saying it's stylish and looks great. The only thing that I didn't like is the size is a bit smaller. Other than that I recommended it for running or as casual pair of shoes.
"Cute, but not as cute as I was expecting. Looks kind of cheap and like something a middle schooler would wear... But still cute."
"I really enjoy the look of the dress, it's a little big but I can just fix it a bit. But overall very good quality."
"beautiful colors, fast delivery, but too large"
4 price nephew loves it
"i have worn crocs for a long time, and i feel that they are just the most comfortable thing you can knock around in. but these croc's have taken the style and look of crocs to a new level. not to mention that amazon had the best price anywhere on line or off! i love them, and i get compliments on them all the time. but after wearing this model a few times, I find it to be much to wide.  I don't know what crocs did to the sizing, but they don't fit anything like my older pairs!! if you have anything short of EEE width, beware what they call the ""roomy fit"". I give them a 3 star rating only because of the style !!"
Didn't fit like I wanted it too. To small
"I ordered one size up and wish I didn't. Medium is too roomy for me (36 chest, 38 hips). May be too short for taller ladies (5'6""+).
Very soft. Stretches out easily. I find that it is very UNsexy with all the uniform horizontal stripes."
"Under arms very wide, will have to wear a tank under or alter."
"At first sight, loved these... the look sleek, modern, come in really nice packaging. That all ended when I went to try one on a tie for the first time and it ruined a tie. Upon further inspection, I noticed the crappy design of these are perfectly setup to easily scratch, cut, or pull threads on your tie. The corners are sharp, and the worst part is the back of the clip tapers down to a sharp, knife-like edge (see pics). They are so tight and hard to clip/slide onto a tie to begin with so I was very careful... still, my first use ended up putting a small cut across the surface of a brand new black tie as it slide on. I was even super careful by using a piece of paper between the back of the tie and the clip, but that made no difference. Ruined tie... so I'm angrily returning this junk. I think I am going to go with an actual folding clip instead of slide-ons. Do not recommend these, unless you want to use them as fancy paper clips.

Update: Customer service contacted me and were very apologetic and helpful. Based on this, I may give another one of their similar products a shot (similar look to these, except they have a spring/clamp style instead of slide on)."
"I got two shirt from this type, one from a cheap brand and this one. This one is slightly better, but not by much. Also the it is good to be in the sun with the kids, but not that good for swimming."
The lenses do an adequate job of blocking the sun but they are somewhat heavy not as sporty as most cycling glasses.
Ok wiith a hat
Have to change out toggle for a lobster claw closure.  Toggle isn't going to stay on a child.
I  like them  just wish they where a little taller
"Full Grain leather is hot and humid, due to sunny work locations.
Need good ventilating / wicking socks."
"3 stars because they are cute,  but the fit was way off for me.  Had to return....the shallow cut made the top of the shoe rub against the top of my foot  & were really uncomfortable.  Also they badly need an insole,  no padding to speak of"
Returned it with no problem.
They are irght
nope
get a half size bigger
"Not good Support, the lace is too soft and stretchy. Probably fine for smaller sizes, but my 42 DD breasts were not supported well. Pretty but not the best fit for me."
"This necklace has a fun design, but it looks more like just tinted glass than anything like a gem. Smoky quartz just doesn't look very classy like I thought it might from the picture. The chain does have a nice look, and the necklace is not bad, but my wife feels like the necklace would be better for a girl than for an adult."
"I thought I might like the bell sleeves, but with the shirt already being loose and flowy, it was a bit too much. The white was pretty thick material but I still would have worn a shirt underneath; didn't really want to. My daughter said it looked more like a pajama top, so I returned it."
This bra is somewhat large and underwire sticks out underneath arm....making it uncomfortable.
I have had 2 of this so far the clasp will undo itself and uoy lode it !!!!  Also the 2nd one l got the tale fell off  however it looks good as a mechanic l wear it all the time and it takes a lot of abuse
Cool concept!  Looks sleek but light weight cheepo leather.  I do like the buckle!
"This is a beautiful scarf, especially considering the cost. It took approximately 2 weeks for the scarf to arrive after placing the order, not too bad as it's shipped from China, but something to take note of.

The scarf is looong and warm, and the wool is very soft. The only downside was that I had to air them out for a few days as they had an ""industrial"" (oily/metallic) smell. Again, after a couple of days, the odor had disappeared.

Highly recommended.

Updated 01/08/2015:
Scarf is in fact not wool, but 100% Acrylic, changing my rating. Still a scarf, but acrylic, not wool, as originally advertised."
Fit was much to big.  Washed it but it didn't shrink very much and it stretches back out as you wear it.  I also had to shorten it up some since it was way to long.  I usually do shorten the legs a bit on most pants but I had to take up quite a bit on this.  I'll order a smaller size next time.  It does keep you warm as advertised.
Very nice looking. However too large. Croc does not offer half sizes. I had to return them. Very roomy.
"love the style...the face, but the band is thin and cheap."
"I bought these in a wider size, they fit like a standard width shoe. They do look nice, and I really only use them when i leave my desk at work, so not very often and not for any extended period of time."
"In this shoe, my foot slides forward so much that there is an inch of shoe sticking out behind my heel. I don't like the way that looks so I'm sending these back."
The shoes are pretty but have a mediocre structure. The straps fall apart and do not secure the foot well.
Grandma looking
The outside is very adorable but the inside seems are so thick that they itch my 4 year olds skin.  She has to wear a top underneath so that the seems don't irritate her skin.
The size fit small so I had to return it.
"They were way to small for what I was looking for, however, the description did say they were ""mini chandelier earrings"""
"Its ok but I buy too small, I use normally size S and buy size M and its too tight so I think you can buy two size more than usually use."
Cute but mine had a run in both socks - 1 more noticeable than the other. Not sure if it's worth the hassle to return since they only cost about $8-9. Very disappointed though because they're so friggin cute!!!  The run is on the front and low enough not too be seen with tall boots on - no bootie style boots for sure unless I'm just slumming lol & just being carelessly casual running errands. But the fit is spot on! They come about 5 inches above my knee not quite mid-thigh but I wasn't expecting that. I'm 5'3 and a size 8.
"Color is much darker than the picture...order a size up if you don't want it to be tight...I got a large which would normally fit very nicely & loose, but not with this dress. It's comfy & I can wear it with leggings that's why it gets 3 stars."
They must have changed the sizing on these or something- they don't the same as my previous purchase of these same panties. I'd suggest sizing up.
Very cute fits well but pills and faded after only a few washes rough material too.
I ordered newborn. The tag on the package said newborn but the hat tag says 0-3. they are cute I'll just have to wait to use them.
Supposed to be full fitting  ....tight ALWAYS wear xl
The ring is very pretty but order at least 2 sizes larger than you wear.  I had to return.
"I just received my dress. Too small! I'm 5'2"" 115 lbs, size 2 - 4, ordered a small. It doesn't have much stretch, just sort of grabs on, hard to walk in it. Hate returns but I have no choice :("
Shrank a lot after first wash (washed cold and dried on low heat).
The color was more red than burgundy
"I have tried Playtex bras only rarely because they tended to do the ""lift and separate"" thing too well (it's no longer as desirable an aesthetic as it was coming out of the 50s and 60s). Also, they FELT too, um, constructed, as if I were wearing architecture. So when I saw these, I thought, hey, this may be a sign of change. I'm not sure it is tho.
Yes, this is more comfortable than the Playtex of old, and more than anything, I appreciate the support that the side panels provide (not fabulous, but enough to notice). Though they are more woven, less sewn together from parts, it still feels constructed somehow. Not as good as their competition, but I suspect better for fuller figured women who are beyond the C cup. It has hooks that seem somehow not easy to find with one's hands behind in contortions. I mean, it's not as if this is something I haven't established skills in after daily practice over decades! The edges also seem scratchy. Finally, like others have observed, Playtex sizes seem to run large. Just looking at the bra, you wouldn't want to put it in a wash machine.
Best aspect? The fabric extends below the cups more than it does in most bras, and this prevents chafing. It want to roll up, but hasn't (yet?)."
I've ordered other Levis from this same page and they fit fine.  However this pair of black was too small. I'll need to lose about 5 lbs for them to fit :-/
These are so cute and even though I ordered a 1/2 size smaller than I wear they are still to big.  But I can wear them with socks and they're not to bad.
The vest is way to small
These are really cute but they don't fit me very well. The back strap constantly slides off the back of my heel. It's really annoying to have to stop and adjust them all the time. The straps will not stay when I pull them up.
Ok for the costume party
"It's loud. That's my only complaint, but it's a big one. It's pretty much as loud as a wall clock."
"I was very excited about these because I have the flip flops and love them!  The flip flops helped me last 12 hours at amusement parks this summer!  These are very comfortable just like all skechers walking shoes are, I was just a little disappointed as they run a little large in the toe area and maybe that's wording it incorrectly, it may be more the style than the size.  I don't like the look of the top of them from where the laces end to the toe tip.  If that makes any sense at all.  I don't know how better else to explain int.  Also these being a solid shoe the flex part isn't as flexy as the flip flops are so they aren't quite the same experience.  But still these are way more comfortable than most any other shoe you can find for walking/working out etc."
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AQT80CA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
I ordered the large that fit size 9-10. I wear a 9 and my heel is slightly over the edge so I wouldn't buy if you wear larger than an 8. If they fit I actually think I would have liked them but the way they are makes it uncomfortable.
To short for what I needed
it looks huge on me but a decent coat.
"They are soft,  They are warm.  But for me they stretched out so much (and I have narrow feet)  that when I walk in them after just having them a few days they would flop down and almost off.  I guess if I just want to sit still, they would be good foot warmers."
"These look richer in the picture, the colors is a dusty off black, red. The design is cute and they're comfortable is why I gave them a three."
Good shoe but need to order a size up. It runs slow.
I ordered medium they were to small so I reordered in large...the colors were perfect.
"The quality and comfort of the slides feel ""okay"" at best to me, not as comfortable as the original ""adilette slides"" though. I'm not entirely satisfied with the product because the material used makes 'em feel stiff after just a couple of minutes of continuous walking. I'm not sure if I want to go through the trouble of returning them since I already wore it outdoors but I definitely can not recommend this to people that are used to wearing comfortable footwear. If you like things that feel somewhat on the stiff side, this might actually feel great for your feet."
"My feet are a bit wide. As a few reviewers have indicated, these sandals' straps feel tight on the top of the foot. The strap on the inner side kept rubbing the top of my feet, making that particular spot quite uncomfortable. These sandals appear to be made of quality material, but it looks like plastic to me. How do they ground people? How well do they work? I'd like to see the evidence."
It's a nice coat but it does run large get a size smaller!!! It is very stiff but it seems to be very warm.
"On the fence about returning it, if I wore a sock it would be ok but it seems like it should be worn without a sock so I think I may exchange for half size smaller"
"These boots are absolutely beautiful.  Great quality.  A nice thick leather.  I bought the wine color - it's a lovely dark distressed red plum color.

I am returning these for several reasons:

1. The calf is too small.  I'm a tiny person but have big calves - 15"" around.  I can get these zipped up but it's tough.  They will stretch eventually but I could not wear them over jeans.

2. Way too much wrinkling around the ankle.  I think this would be alleviated if the calves were wider.  I suppose they look nice on thinner legs.

3. The bottoms are made from the hard material, not somewhat soft or rubbery, so when I walk around, I sound like a horse. CLOP CLOP CLOP.

4. The ties are not real and cannot be adjusted.  If I could adjust the laces, it would help with the wrinkling at the ankles because I could then adjust them to fit my ankles.

Too bad I had to return.  These are beautiful."
"My ballerina daughter needed a pair of black shoes for a performance.  She didn't need something good - this part was more acting than dancing.  She wears a 6.5, but they don't have half sizes, so we bought a 7 to be safe.  They are REALLY big - more than a half size should be.  So, if you are a half size, order down instead of up (unless you like your technique shoes to be loose).  The elastic does cinch them up enough that they don't look loose, but they feel loose.  Also, she says they they aren't real split soles.  They have two pads on the outside to look like a split sole, but a solid sole on the inside (so her feet don't look ""pretty"" when pointed)  This really bugs her because her feet are flexible and strong enough to really need/want a real split sole.  If you are a beginner, or you only need them for light dancing in a show, they're fine, save the money.  But if you are a dancer who needs black technique shoes (for real floor and barre work), look elsewhere.  Honestly, I wish I'd just gone to our normal place and spent the extra $10 for something that would make her happy.  But again, if you are new to ballet, or an actor who doesn't need them for real ballet, they should be fine."
Be 5 stars if I had one size bigger
The toe box is too small.  The reviews said they are comfortable for those with foot issues but within a minute or two the left foot hurts a lot.  I need to return them but received no invoice with the shipment.
At the time I was a size 10 and I really struggled to get it over my rear end. Ended up returning it.
"I have this in yellow already, bought the green and it fits slightly smaller than the yellow. Other than that, it's cute."
I got the coral colored one.  I think this dress clings around my mid section and seems to accentuate it too much.  Still nice to wear around the house.
"The shoes are very cute, but too small! Unable to wear them for more than a couple of minutes."
Just OK - I liked a couple others that I received better.
"The print and color of this shirt are fine, but the material is somewhat flimsy/thin.  It has not been worn yet so it remains to be seen how it holds up after being washed several times."
"I bought this sweater in grey and white.  The grey looks okay-- you get what you pay for. It's on the cheap side, but it's soft and lightweight and looks fine.  It hangs pretty long in front for my taste and I'm 5'9"" so I can imagine it would look enormous on someone shorter.  I ordered a size 1X-- I usually am a 16-18 at Loft (if that's a helpful reference) and it's a bit big.  I probably could have gone a size smaller.

The white, however, looked ridiculous. It was sort of sheer but in my opinion looked like someone made a sweater out of my husband's undershirts (which is I guess what they did?).  I will definitely be returning the white."
"This costume was the quality of Target or Walmart costumes. If you are okay with that, then this product is okay! It was cute and fit well. We ended up returning it for a different one with better quality."
It looks much bigger in the picture.
"Ouch, you'll have to start out a little earlier if you plan on wearing these, they should have come with a shoe horn. They do not have a side or back zipper they are slip on. I would have paid $10.00 more for a zipper. With that out of the way, I have to mention they are some sharp looking boots, and once you get them on they make a pretty nice statement, whatever it is you're trying to say, the Yeeeeeeehaw comes when you finally get them on. Because they look so good on and comfort level is tolerable I won't bother sending them back, but they won't be my go to pair of boots, hopefully they will stretch with time. Then I'll be a happy cowgirl."
"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, I really like it, but it is quite a bit shorter than the picture shows, I with it was longer, I got a size up because I wanted it baggy, which it is but it's just not long like it shows in the picture, also the side slits are too high... This suits my needs, I only got it to wear when I have to go in the rain to take down my banners for my business and in Hawaii it rains so much, I wanted a cute hoodie for that purpose, so it does the job. I'm not sure that I would wear it otherwise. The slits are too high and it's too short... I have a normal torso... I would understand if I had an exceptionally long torso but I don't. So that's why I only gave it 3 stars."
"a little squeaky on some surfaces.
nice shoes. A little worn after a year of office work
black wearing off and i have waxed these a few months back"
"So awesome and cute but it doesn't fit right. States ""one size fits all"", but it doesn't fit me right. I will probably have it fitted."
If you're looking for a skimpy bikini that looks like a thong with the butt then get this LOL!!!
"The material is silky and thin. There is lining in the bust area which is nice. I will definitely wear a bralette underneath as it is very low cut and I'm a 34D. I ordered up a size thinking there would be more bust coverage, but its still very low cut and a little too big. I would go with your normal size"
"...to these outfits from overseas--they are usually very well-priced, & like nothing all the other babies wear from walmart, etc...the unique factor weighs in many of my decisions...

over the past couple years, even the shipping has vastly improved on most items--rarely taking longer than 10-12 days now--(for those of us who've waited for 6+ weeks on a slow boat from china, this is ah-mazing!)

i ordered this outfit, too-it'll be here in a couple days--after re-reading the reviews, i noticed a major complaint is ""fading"", so...i'm wondering if we wash the items in cold, SALT water, first off, before wearing--if that would help ""fix"" the dye...?

i'm going to try it, on this outfit & see if it is helpful...the shorts seem to fade pretty bad--going from black to grey in two washes...

on another review, i compared our ""relationship"" with these clothing companies to an abusive domestic situation...those feelings have not changed--now, i think i'm in the ""i can fix it"" stage...

good ol' american ingenuity, huh? let's hope the salt bath works!"
Thought the fit would be a bit more snug. The fabric is also itchy and not sensitive for fragile skin.
"I really wanted to love this shoe (and keep it), but unfortunately, it is too small around my big toe, on both feet, plus I never have this issue with other shoes. I doubt going up a size would resolve this because other than the big toe issue, it fits very well."
"beautiful boots,  color is amazing
but leather is very stiff making the boots  very uncomfortable,  i couldn't flex my feet,  difficult to walk."
It's ok....it fits as expected  (use the sizing chart!!) But it's a bit satiny for what I was wanting. I understand what other reviews meant about all the excess fabric under the arms but i think it depends on your body shape. The extra fabric didn't look too bad on me
They are ok. They are much to small. They still work but I would have preferred them a little larger.
This is good in material and print but even the smallest size is too big if you are a slim person. Need to do some alterations to make it fit.
"These socks are cute.  If only I could wear them like the models.  The problem is that the thigh part is extremely tight.  I can pull them all the way up, but the elastic band around the top feels like a tourniquet, and I'm sure they would cut off my circulation if I kept them up more than a few minutest. Unless you're blessed with really slender thighs, you are not going to be able to wear these socks pulled up much past your knees.  I had planned to wear these with knee length dresses and skirts--like tights.  I can only comfortably wear them as knee socks. I will keep them to wear around the house only."
"This is a nice enough facial product. I'm an older woman though, and it didn't do anything miraculous for me. My daughter used the other one (we had a facial night at home which was fun). She liked the product better than I, but she's 25 and anything makes her skin look great. My skin did feel better.. but as much as this product cost, it would be worth it to add a bit more and go for a salon facial."
I like most things about these leggings but I washed them as directed and then was wearing them for the first time and there's already a hole in the waist band :(  Sad.
"I have tried several times from different sellers to find a comfortable bra with support without the underwire.  It is more comfortable than the others but like all the others, the bottom does ride up."
"I get lots of compliments on these glasses,for about a month then one of the arms feel off.  Sadness. Really bummed."
Shirt is short but pants are very long. It's cute but weird sizing
"They fit very small. I had to return them. I would suggest ordering two sizes up. Other than that, they were ok.."
Comfy but not very durable.  Had them only a few months and already starting to lose shape. 3 more words.
Gorgeous! but need to exchange for next size up.
"These are warm and soft. As other reviewers mentioned, after wearing and washing they pill. Otherwise, I'm 5'3 and they fit perfectly."
cheap looking but good for swimming as I was looking for something used in the water. Will be using it.  Thank you!
They look great but it isn't the most comfortable shoe in the world. I had problems with them scratching the back of my Achilles's tendon the first time I wore them. If I'm just going to grab something to eat I'll throw these on but I wouldn't wear them if I had to do a lot of walking all day.
"One of the ""Male"" portion of the button clip pair came off after 2 weeks.

Why not 1/2 stars? Good INITIAL quality
Why not 4 stars? Because of the button
Why not 5 stars? Need more time to find out if the quality would have sustained over time"
"Too large, i had to return them. Order 1 size under"
Not exactly like picture.
"This product does not look like the picture. The one I received did not have the chain behind the skull and had these goofy looking flowers on the skull's head. The flowers came off and went into the garbage with very little effort to remove them. I am keeping this item because it is for a costume and it doesnt seem to be a bad piece, just falsely advertised. I will not turst this company enough to buy from them in the future."
"Great design on this flip flop, but the fabric is kind of thick between your big toe and the second toe, kinda uncomfortable, especially because it rubs the skin there."
"Not a fault on the sandals, my foot is a little wider so the fit was a little snug."
"Fits ok, but not as snug as the 1 piece suits they make."
"Very very sheer. Not to be worn with guests/kids around. I got the yellow one, and it's more a dingy beige. There's a little ruffle under the lace detail that kinda ruins it."
"the pendant itself is nice for costume jewelry. It gets 3 stars for that because frankly it is nice, but not worth 10 dollars IMHO.

The necklace was a waste of space. The shipped necklace might as well be a choker. The necklace itself is not the one pictured, but a horrid fake gun metal grey snake chain."
"Shear, and the color in the picture shows it being lighter beige, its more tan."
Actually very pretty but worried about having to clean the delicate moving parts if it darkens as silver does. Opted for a bit more expensive white gold piece.
I like most about my Samsonite luggage Omni it's lightweight least it's not as big as I wanted and hopefully it's durable being lightweight like it is I'm not sure but I'll find out
okay nothing to be excited about
"I am a huge Timberland fan but the boat shoes, not so much.  For boat shoes, I expect to be able to go barefoot.  Not with these, for two reasons: first, the top inside towards the middle rubs on the arch of your feet; and second, the insole falls apart and ends up rolling up into a ball.  With socks, they are fine."
"These are PERFECT for costume use. Mine arrived with a defect (a gouge in the finish at the back of one of the heels), but since it was for a costume, I ignored it. As they come in only one width, I had to insert my own inner-sole inserts to help take up some of the excess roominess since I have very narrow feet. I used an insert with a little arch support and that made the boot less like a boat on me and much easier to walk in (I don't normally wear anything close to high-heels).
I'll just say that EVERYONE commented on how much they loved the boots. They really brought my 1960's themed costume to perfection!"
"I have the American large which fit perfectly. The red is slightly on the purple side so I would say its a wine with a hint on plum.

The material is where I'm not satisfied. This shirt is almost paper thin, but also doesn't breathe very well."
I love Oofos flip flops and thought I would love these too!  They are a little tight and hurt my little toes..I do not have wide feet at all!  I will keep trying them and hoping they stretch out a little more.  I wish Oofos would make more sandal styles as they are the most comfortable soles of any shoes that I own!!  Maybe a cross strap..something more stylish and dressy!
This suit is so cute and well made but the padding is just too much for me. I think this is a perfect suit for larger chested woman because the padding is supportive and not stiff but for me as a b-cup it just looked like I was stuffing my suit lol!
"Its okay.  Seems small considering it was ordered cautiously.  My wife hasn't tried it for a substantial time, so time will tell.  The back has the tie strings which I wasn't too impressed with - not visible in photo."
"I did as suggested in other reviews and bought larger than I would usually wear.  I am 5'2"", 125 lbs and the large was ok on me.  I will be sending it back though.  I needed something I could literally wear out of the box (rush order) and this needs some work, a steam press of some type.  It's very thin material and it comes wrinkled and the skirt is not at all pleated as the picture shows.  It might look like this with a little work, but considering how thin it is, I'm afraid to try and iron it or steam it."
"Waist and upper thighs  fit fine, but the foot opening was so tiny I could hardly get the pants over my feet and certainly didn't fit my calves. The lace was not stitched in all places so stuck out.  They are also very very long, I'm 5'9 and there was an excess 3 inches."
"For the price it is a good bag, would not abuse it too much."
I got two of these for my sister and my niece they both liked it now I need a few more
"Way too small.  I wear a 3X in American sizes, ordered a 4X in this, and cannot zip it (I am busty, but it wasn't even close).  Would guess that the 4X would fit an American 1X best."
The elastic ban wraps rather tight around the feet and the sandal is very low to the ground. It is not what I would call a walking shoe for an all day walking tour.
A nice shoe but it wrinkles in the toe area
I like them... but a little too big...
Thought I would like the fabric but it is not what I expected. Do not breathe well
"My daughter loved this ""tiara"" but much flimsier than expected. In the picture, it looks like there are faux stones or shiny plastic the top of the tiara but it is just fabric. But my daughter loves it anyway, so I guess that's what matters."
"I loved it, and my son loved it. There are a few things that bothered me. The shoe covers were fairly small, and didn't stay on my son's shoes all that well. Also, as this is a ""straight cut"" suit, I should have gotten the next larger size. My son is slim and tall, and it was snug beyond belief on his little belly. The hat was cute, but the little antenna were poking through the cover/fabric when I opened the pack. A minor inconvenience. Price was right (MUCH cheaper than the local costume shops). Overall - a winner!"
"I think these leggings are great, they are super thick and the fleece inside is plush and almost like fur, not like regular fleece.  However, my 4 year old has flat out refused to wear them, saying the outside is ""scratchy.""  She has some sensory integration issues, so if yours do to, just be aware . . ."
"My toddler's an Umizoomi fan, so we got this to be his carryon on our flight to Hawaii. It worked just fine for that, but it is a bit big for a 2-3 year old. He's a larger kid, too. He can carry it just fine. The size's just a bit awkward. I think it's designed for more of a kindergarten backpack rather than preschool. HOWEVER, I wouldn't recommend it for any kind of daily use. We rarely really use it. For doctor's appointments to carry toys, maybe, because he likes carrying it around. But he doesn't go to daycare or anywhere he uses it regularly and the picture on the front is already peeling off. :/ It's okay for minimal use, but I wouldn't plan on using this for the ""yearly"" backpack."
The material its wack
The hat was too small for an 8 month old and I had to cut it. The suit didn't fit well until he was 20months (he was 85th percentile for height).
It doesn't fit correctly to my son's (4) fat feet :(
Its ok! Looks cheap
The problem with these boots was the footbed started curling at the toe and was a nuisance. The company cannot just send you a replacement which I do not understand. But at least Merrell ended up crediting me for the boots.
Cute but did not receive the ones pictured .  My sons favorite is rubble and we did not receive that one 
"This boat shoe is the best for its price. More expensive versions are from LLBean and others. However, though the price is similar to what they cost a few years ago, it's obvious that they are no longer all leather -- perhaps a compromise to keep costs down. We live in the rural mountains so rely on Amazon to purchase major clothing items, and found these delivered promptly."
"I had a similar pair of these that were wearing out, so wanted to replace them. My old ones had ""air holes"" in the toe area, but I wanted to try these, with the enclosed toe area. Unfortunately, no are holes, combined with the rubber material, makes for a very sweaty foot!  They were comfortable and provided enough support and grip, but the did not breath well at all. I returned them, and got the Dawgs with the ""air holes"". Much better!"
It was OK but is was too small.  I wear a size 10-12 and this dress was so tight and so short on me. The back of the dress is too high.  I had to return it.
"Barely covers my butt, but it worked for what I bought it for. Better for someone who's not curvy, but otherwise it's a cute costume and the quality isn't bad."
"Nice, but if it is like other Maxine's, it will disintegrate after a couple months of use."
"Ordered a medium even though I'm normally a small because I'm pregnant.  This dress is quite literally a sack on me and is baggy in the chest.  Debating returning, but thinking it will probably fit when I'm 8-9 months pregnant!"
"I ordered my regular size in these boots. When I got them, I really liked how they looked. The fit is very loose around the ankle and in the width (and I have slightly wide feet). It was also plenty big in the calf (and I have med. - large calves) for a size 6.5. Overall, they are comfortable, but fit much bigger overall than I expected."
"Very stylish purse. Whenever I wear it I do not fail to eat at least one compliment.

However, downside is that it doesn't have any pockets or separators to store keys or lipgloss. So you end up taking a lot of time sifting through all your items to find your keys.

Additionally, doesn't have a zipper and the little magnetic clasp to keep the purse shut is just not enough. Anyone can glance in and see your personal items or even easily snatch something out of here.

5 stars for looks, 1 star for usability."
"I'm not used to having to suffer through ""breaking in"" Keen shoes, but these were hell on my feet for the first several wears. Much smaller toe box than I expected. They'll do fine I guess, but I will not buy this style again."
"I had to return this as it was way too big and I usually love all Easy Spirit. However, if you do not have special foot problems, it is a good buy."
but not great either. Was a starter buy and has been used a few times. A bit itchy on my breasts because of the lace. Pretty sure the thong wore out a while ago. Didnt feel like it was worth the 40. Should have been 20-25
Good socks just not my style . Didn't pay attention to designs
"I really wanted to love this bra.  It is very supportive, easy to manage, and wonderful to have.  However I have learned that I can not wear this bra for long and I certainly can not sleep in it.  The wide elastic folds up and irritates my skin sometime fierce.  I have the bravado tank tops that I bought with my first born and those are fabulous.  Those can be worn any time all the time.  I do not recommend this bra."
The size says XL but they are very very tight. The quality is very high but I don't know who they would fit. I wear size 4 pants and they are too small for me.
"These sandals (style Sanrah) will be fine for some people, but I was hoping they would be a substitute for the Florence, which seems to no longer be offered. The Florence was like a miracle shoe to me and I went through several pairs each year. The Sanrah does not offer the flatness nor the stability of the Florence. They also seem loose--probably no more so than the Florence, but looseness becomes more of a safety issue when you raise and narrow the heel and take away the heel wrap.
I will be in mourning until they bring back the Florence!"
"Gave to my daughter, seems to be a quality product I was wishing the fabric was a little less shear, but was ok."
"THE SHOE FITS SLIGHTLY TIGHT WHERE THE WIDTH MEASURES AND I KNOW THAT WILL STRETCH OUT WITHIN A FEW WEARINGS, OTHERWISE IT'S A NICE SHOE."
I purchased these for a wedding that I was and I ended up not wearing them and not returning them because I wasn't going to pay for the return shipping I sold them in a garage sale for a lot cheaper than what I paid because they were too small by the Size up!
"Warm but kinda small, hopefully it will stretch"
"I am 5'6"", 145 pounds, 31"" waist; somewhat athletic build. The size chart indicates I am a size L. I read the reviews and bought the medium. I could not come close to fastening it. I kept it and ordered the L, hoping that wearing the large for a while, I would be able to get into the medium. I have been wearing the size large for a few days and i can't tell a difference. I don't really look slimmer with it on. My waist measures the same with or without it. It is really difficult to fasten, yet it doesn't feel tight. Maybe because I am comparing it to a corset. I have never used a wait trainer like this, but I have worn corsets.
I wonder if other reviewers just work harder to get it fastened to a tighter row of hooks. I seriously don't think I can but I will try.
3 stars because it does seem to be wel made, and it is comfortable. I am withholding judgement until I give it more of a chance."
"This was really cute, made very well. Did run small  I ordered a size larger.  Corset is a little hard to get into and the little metal latches were a little hard to get to hook together . I did return because it was just not what I was looking for."
"I bought the men's US 10.5.

Pros:
- waterproof
- fairly cheap
- seem well made (so far)

Cons:
- removable foam insole is completely flat (no arch support). I use an aftermarket insole that provides arch support.
- the footbed (underneath the removable insole) curves upward in the toe. It makes me feel like I am standing with my toes lifted off the ground and is not that comfortable.
- they really don't breathe at all. Or, at least much more poorly than other waterproof boots I've had.

Overall: It feels a little weird to have to use $60 insoles to make a $40 pair of boots comfortable. They do keep my feet dry in wet conditions, though. I'll reserve final judgement until I know how long they last."
Alot of loose threads. Seems to be intacted. Looks good for the price.
"Stay true to your size when ordering. I bought an XL because there were earlier reviews
on Powell shirts saying they were too short, or too small. A large (my size) would have
fit perfect, now I'm stuck with an XL because Amazon wants to charge for shipping on the return.

Just a tip...."
"Did not like the quality and the cut was a little off, but fit well"
The flats looked exactly as shown and quality is good.  I found the toe area  too narrow and I don't have wide feet.  I had to return these nice casual flats.
Usually we buy two pairs a year.  This sandal only lasted 2 months and the thong broke away from the shoe.  We ordered another pair and hope that this won't happened again so soon.
Wasn't as long as it looks in picture.
sent it back. bigger than I thought and too soft
"These jeans have a similar fit and feel to Old Navy carpenter jeans, except they are stretchy. The legs are straight, but wide like carpenter jeans, and the waist on my size 36 was sized correctly, and a bit stretchy too. The thing I didn't like was the length. The 36W all come in 33.75L however mine fit more like a 36L. I usually wear a 32L and they come down to the floor, these were 4 longer, I measured. I also noticed they're a bit pricey. The thin lightweight denim may not hold up as well as Levis, however like I said, they feel like Old Navy; and for me those hold up for years. I don't usually wear stretchy cloths, but at ;least they aren't skinny jeans."
Great fit but I don't feel yummy. They don't have any shapewear happening and they are see through in the a**. Not ideal
"Very nice watch, however got mine with defective night light, and an offset in the second hand maker, it will not set to 12, but slightly off. Nice style and the band is cool."
"I would LOVE to give these babies 5 stars but.... I CAN'T. The ball is WAY smaller than 4mm. So small that I wear them in my 2nd ear hole. And last but not least, they went from Gold to Silver. I WILL SAY that they don't bother me (and i have VERY sensitive skin) But... not EXACTLY what I paid for. That is all!"
Very pretty but the shoes run very small. I'm normally a  9 1/2 so I bought the 10. They were too small. the 11's would most likely be too long so I'm just returning them.
Tight on my cheeks and it broke towards the end of the night.
"This gets 3 stars because while it does fit as it should, and it definitely holds the girls in place, it tends to minimize them some, which I don't like because as a slightly bigger girl, the wrong shirt tends to make my chest and the rest of me blend in. The bra is pretty comfy in and of itself, but because the wires come up so far in between the breasts, it can be hard to wear a shirt/dress that when worn shows any sort of cleavage because the bra tends to peak through. That being said, if you wear a high necked halter or don't plan to wear a V-neck, its  a good bra for that. it definetly does not slide, or make me spend time hiking it up. and as a DD it keeps things where they should be."
"The zipper moves a lot, makes noise on every step and zipper does not zip smoothly. The show would have been a nice wear without these issues."
"the sizing and descriptions were way off on these pants.  After ordered several different kinds and sizes, I gave up"
I am size 34 but I usually get a size 36 for a more comfortable fit. But the fit of this jeans is somewhat small/tight. I recommend to get a size bigger.
TIE WAS  THE WRONG COLOR
Top is very sexy & fits great for my 34D cup. But the bottom is too too big. The front is almost as equal as the back. Keeping just for the top.
I liked the style but the feel of the fabric irritates me for some reason.
"Not as cool as I thought, but still a nice watch to add to the collection."
"I have pulls in the thighs already. I guess I should have gotten a larger size. Still love them htough. Will wear them more once it gets warmer, unfortunately im not sure how"
Definitely just a Tad smaller than I expected which causes it to rid up a bit. But otherwise nice shirt. Not a breathable material so be careful on hotter days.
Pretty.  Return policy not the best.
Cute but strap over the foot fit small and tight.
It's a cute little change bag.
"I wouldn't spend the money on this ring, first off, I was disappointed the picture of the ring is a little different then the 'real' thing.  Also, i had it for about 2 weeks and the spinner rings are starting to tarnish where they have been welded together to make the ring."
"I am 5'4, 160 lb's, purchased a Lrg. These leggings go just past my knees and I always feel like I have to pull them down because they keep riding up. Also the waist band doesn't seem to stay up, it keeps rolling down. I'm constantly pulling them up when I'm walking. I'm not sure if I should purchase a Medium for the waist issue, but then the legs would be even shorter !! Ugh!"
I really wanted this to fit.  But it doesn't.
"This is ok. It looks like on the model that a small portion of your back is covered and that only a bit of your tummy shows, but the cut for me ended up looking very different. Essentially my entire back shows and a good portion of the sides of my stomach. I like it, but I feel a little exposed when I wear it. I will update with photos when I get the chance."
My husband has very difficutl to fit feet.  We are trying to stretch these shoes so he can wear them.
Runs big. Knit fabric is very thin. Not expecting much for price.
Quite cheap looking but it's from China..
"to big for me , and the lock is to hart to open ."
"Same size as another dress I order from this brand, and it's so tight I can't zip the top. Also very short."
Needed a Mickey Mouse shirt for a costume.  This was inexpensive and fit the bill for what I needed. Pretty thin fabric - but really isn't needed for too much.
"Definitely a quality product, but has an odd-cut. I realize we all are very different, so you may find it fits you fine."
"The socks are of a decent quality and are okay... Just something about the fit is a little off, the heel seems to shift to the side. Also, the fit was a little snug. The fabric is not really a comfy feel even after washing. Still, I got them as a lightning deal so the price was cheap. I would not purchase again. These socks are that last ones I pull from my drawer to wear."
these are not easy to get on an 18 moth old let alone twins.  sizing at this company needs to be revisited.  18 to 2 months is odd.  better to comply with usual sizes or just the length of the inside of the shoe to get the best fit.  they are very cute and the service was excellent.
"I have extra small hands as in I wear extra small lab gloves, the kind that teenagers would wear. No one else in my lab actually has hands as small as me.

Therefore, when I read the other reviews that said these gloves were loose, I was a little worried that these gloves would be too big on me. The reviewers even mentioned that they had long thin slender fingers. I figured if it was loose on them, it might be crazy loose on me. Well, these gloves were definitely not loose. They were super tight.

I think this may be designed for people with long thin fingers, which are elegant. My hands are by no means chubby and plump. They are just short and regular thickness.  I think if you have similar hands as mine or similar width-- at least-- you would find these gloves to be tight.

Other than that, the color looks just as pictured. I would say it is an off-white creamy color.

---- Update 23-March-2013

Okay, I am updating my reviewing. I just dropped a star.  These are REALLY tight.  I don't know if this is my imagination, but they seem to be shrinking not widening to my hands over time.  Perhaps, it is not that.  Perhaps it is just the fact that it is getting so darn cold around here.

When I put my hands into these, they seem to attract the cold.  I didn't understand how this was possible when other reviewers said this. I mean, I figured these are cloth.  They, at worst, should only be able to warm the hands a little--right?  Well, I was wrong.  These gloves really do attract coldness.  On close inspection, I see why.  There are little air holes in the gloves all throughout. I guess this was a design feature by the manufacturer to make it more stylish and also to allow ventilation. It would make sense to wear these gloves in warm weather then.

Nonetheless, it is still wintery now. The weather and the material of these gloves are really not suited for really cold weather. You may want to try cashmere gloves. I think next time I will buy cashmere for this purpose.  If you want to wear these gloves for spring and you have long slender fingers, then these may be great for you.  For those of us with shorter smaller hands, who just want some warmth in winter, these are probably not right."
"I'm 34DDD so ordered a large and while the top band fits well, there is just too much fabric draping down over the front. Looks like I'm wearing a sack. Usually love Patty products and this top is a nice color (as pictured in purple) and nice soft fabric, too bad it just doesn't fit well for me :-( May work for someone who is taller or larger all over but not for smaller girls with large chest."
I really wanted these shoes but they were too tight across the arch.  Had to return them.
Nice looking shoes.  Kind of shinny.  One string was longer than the other don't know why.
I'm a 38 C and it fits like a B.
Good pajamas if your kids are tall and thin as the legs and arms are quite tight.
"got size 16 and they hurt my foot. ....I had to make cuts in the top to be able to wear them.

Especially if you have a wide foot,you might want to get a size larger !!"
I felt that the band was tight on these and I purchase other Warner product the same size
Very thin material and the length was much much shorter than expected.
"These start out as great jeans. They're not at all the cowboy look you'd expect from Wrangler. Instead, they're cut in a smart slim fit from a cool, slightly relaxed canvas that's lightweight and comfortable and great for a casual-dressy look where regular jeans aren't appropriate. And they fit just as they're sized and labeled when you put them on right out of the package and wear them for a day. But you won't be able to do your happy-fit dance in them once they're washed; I couldn't get them over my hips after their first and only tumble in the dryer. What's more, Amazon doesn't let you return stuff after 30 days. So if you wash them and put them in a normal-person jeans rotation, you might not discover they've become denim socks until after Amazon has declared them to be now and forever yours. If you do buy them, enjoy them while you can. But then learn from my dashed hopes and dreams and keep them three counties away from the nearest dryer."
"fit as expected, the strap feels loose."
"I ordered down a half size, but a full size might have been a better length.  Kept them because there wasn't another one in the smaller size."
liked 100% cotton.  Bottom hem rolls after a washing.  Size is somewhat small. Should have ordered next size larger but will male do until next order.
WORKS WELL LOVE THAT IT CLEANS SO EASILY AND COVERS MY DAUGHTER CHEST COMPLETELY. I ONLY GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE I HONESTLY WISH THAT THE AREA OF THE NECK TO SECURE THE BIB WAS ANOTHER MATERIAL IT'S PLASTIC AND IT DOESNT SEEM VERY COMFY SO IM ACTUALLY THINKING OF TAKING IT OUT AND REPLACING IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS AND WORKS VERY WELL KEEPING EVERYTHING MY DAUGHTER EATS OFF OF HER CLOTHES BUT ITS NOT VERY COMFY AND THATS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME. I DID RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST REVIEW
"It's alright. They don't look QUITE as nice as in the pictures, but they will serve their purpose. They feel a big cheap, but it is at the end of the day a tie clip. Not sure what I was expecting."
"I bought this tray because when I come home I have my keys, my watch, and my wallet that I immediately take off. I wear a couple different watches depending on the situation and day, so I liked having four quadrants because then I can have both watches and my keys and my wallet all put away. I had another tray, but I am fussy, and I noticed that when I just dumped everything into the other tray, the keys would scratch my watches, so I wanted something to separate them. Overall, it is a good product. I have only had it a few months, but the stitching seems to be good, and it is not falling apart. It is just a storage tray so that is all you can expect from something like this. The reason I gave it an average rating, was because the individual quadrants are a little small. They are fine for my keys and watches, but it doesn't really fit my wallet. I still put my wallet in it, but it is just kind of crammed in and hangs out a bit (and I carry a slim wallet, with only a few bills and a couple credit cards). Not the end of the world, but still would like the tray to be a little bigger for the price."
"I don't like this product.  The material was uncomfortable, the arms are too long, and the arms fit too tight.  I am petite and the arms were still too tight. I returned this."
I have to say they are ok.  Simply because they are too big.  Way too big.  However they are made very well and I was please to see they were on the thicker side of fleece.  I donated mine to a homeless shelter but would of worn them and kept them had I gotten the correct size.  Thinking that was part of the problem although I do think sizing is generous.  Had they fit I would of 5 starred this item but in all fairness I could not fully review the item.
"As with all Pleaser items, you want to order a size larger. So I did that. And they fit great length wise but no matter how lose I string the laces, the shoes still pinch the bridge of my foot. Making the patent tongue dig in... I'm hoping if I wear them for long enough they'll break in, if not they're going to end up on Craigslist.

Amazon.com was great though. It was 8 dollars for regular shipping at 10 for expedited. So I payed the extra 2 dollars [international shipping] and BOTH pairs of shoes that I received were delivered the day after I received word that they were shipped via e-mail. I ordered a pair of Please, Dolly, Spectator platforms on the 27th of March, was informed they were shipped on the first and on the 2nd, my birthday, they were here!

=D I was impressed both times. Amazon is also wonderful with returns if you want them, pleasing over the phone, and takes care of taxes/duty fees for international orders.

So whenever I look for items on Amazon I always look for them from the seller Amazon first. Nothing else compares."
A little thinner than I expected but it's holding up just fine.
"A bit small. Not to the point of calling them unwearable though. I wish they stretched more. Basically, these are to look at only while spicing it up in the bedroom. Just being honest."
Chain needs to be longer--otherwise it is a GREAT piece!
Toe a little tight but shoe is a good deal for the price point. I like trotter's.  I am rarely disappointed.
"they are really cute, but the wire going thru my ear is too wide, and they hurt.  So I'm sending back."
"This would have been perfect, but it runs tight at the waist. If you have a tummy like I do, you may not like it. I liked the very long length to cover my hips while working out. (It's a nice shirt and can be worn with dressy pants.) I am a size large shirt and ordered the 2X because reviewers said it ran very small, which it does. I'm hoping a 3x will give me a looser fit in the waist."
"Nice, just too small."
I ordered a pair of these for my daughter and myself and was disapointed that they were not as sparkly as they appeared on the site.  They will be ok to wear if my hair is down but the quality is not what I expected
"I have not worn them as yet, but they are dangly about an inch and a half long, not very sparkly though, but you get what you pay for."
It was ok but didn't really fit under my dress well...the bottom part of my dress just didn't look right.
"The 6MM Tungsten Comfort Fit Wedding Band is not a great ring, but it's good enough. I did not want to invest a lot of $ for a ring to be a temporary substitute for my real wedding band while traveling abroad.
I do have to say it is a very comfortable ring to wear and has held up very well. The finish has not scratched or dulled."
"Shoe was made in India, I knew they would be too small before I tried them on. Seems like all items from India are under sized. Had to return shoes to seller."
"I purchased this watch while deployed in 2007.  It performed flawlessy from that time until about 6 months ago.  At this point, I started leaving it in sunlight or bright interior light to keep it charged.  The display and functions were behaving as though the battery was dead.
I replaced the battery per manual instructions, resetting it prior to new battery insertion.
About three months later, more of the same behavior, no display, going to sleep for long periods only to have to be reprogrammed upon waking up.
Before I replace it, I will replace the battery one more time.
I do this because this device is nearly irreplaceable in my liesure time activities, Hashing (trail running).
With the four actual functions, I can predict local weather fairly well and the necessity of having to correct the time or replace the battery constantly has made this a watch I will replace only if I really have to and it will be with another Pathfinder series!"
"This dress is just... kind of weird. I've ordered 2 other G2 dresses in the past, so I kind of was expecting this. I really think they focus on making their dresses ""one size fits all"" rather than actually accommodating the average female body. Let me start at the beginning, though.

The material of this dress is soft and stretchy, which is comfortable. But it snags and wrinkles easily. You can see some wrinkles in the pics from how it was folded in the bag. Not really an issue, as I'm sure it will smooth out.

The colors are bright and true to the picture. The pink is bright and the navy pattern is dark and a good contrast.

The real problem for me is the fit. I would say I'm a little taller than the average female at 5'8"". This dress comes about 3 inches above my ankles, which isn't a huge deal, but it's not a very flattering length as it reveals my thick ankles and just bottom of my large calves. Size-wise, I'm typically a medium, 150 pounds, 34B bra. The dress fits my stomach and hips well enough, however, it's the boobs that are the problem. The boobs are always a problem, sigh.

The boob area kind of has a reinforced lining with a double portion of material. However, this ""cup"" is extremely tiny, and this is coming from someone with not so large boobs. It barely covers my nipple. Above this cup and towards the center of the chest is a lot of loosely gathered material that just sort of hangs there down your midline. If it's laying flat it looks ok, but since it's so loose, any slight movement could expose your boobs wide open. I really don't like this design and I thought this dress looked different from the picture, but alas, it is just as problematic as the other G2 dresses I got.

To be honest, I'm not sure if my boobs are too big or too small for this dress. As I said, the double lined bra area is so tiny, but all of the extra fabric makes it seem like it is meant for someone with a big rack to fill out. It's kind of like it was sewn by someone who doesn't understand how boobs work. Plus, the big knot thing in the center of your chest just really isn't flattering.

Overall, I think I've learned my lesson. Even though these dresses look super cute in the pictures, they just don't fit me well. I see that they look good on other people in their reviews, so maybe it's just me, I don't know.

I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I feel kind of bad only providing 3 stars, but I'm not being coerced into giving 5 stars because I got something cheap."
It was an ok gift int he stocking.
I can't believe the cup is so small.
"Loose everywhere but tight in these chest to the point where it opens at my cleavage :(
However I feel super Azn school /anime girl/ waitressy when I wear this. Idk"
I really like the design of these shoes however they are not comfortable at all! I understand most heels aren't but these are horrible. I wore them once to a restaurant and I couldn't even stand long while waiting for my table. There's no cushion at all they're completely flat so it gets super uncomfortable rather quickly.
"These shoes are super cute....except they're a little snug in my toes, and the tip part isn't long enough to completely cover my toes, you can still see the cracks of my smaller toes. If you have wide feet don't purchase, they're not wide at all."
"After one week of wearing it, two stones fell out!"
It's a beautiful jacket but you need to scroll down to the abyss to see just what you're getting.
"These are cute, but the waistband is very elastic and tight. The rest of the panties fits as expected, but the waist is not flattering at all.
I'm a size 12 so I didn't feel great about ordering a 1/2x to begin with, so the fact that they were still tight on top bummed me out."
Waistline very small.
Lots of useful functions. But much too bulky!
Looks cheaper in person. And a little bib.
"These are cute, sole-wise the fit perfectly but the straps are too wide. I had to punch in a new hole on each strap to make the tighter but the front strap is still too wide, I can wear them if I don't have a lot of walking to do but I can't imagine myself wearing these for a long period of walking time. They are really cute though! I wish they'd fit better.

I'm usually a size 10-10.5US, I ordered these in 11US. So we can say they run a bit small as well. I put they fit ""somewhat large"" because of the straps."
too flippin small!
"With lower settings, pad does not heat up. Even with HIGH setting the heat I get is not good enough."
I have used this brand for years then I tried a different brand at the same time I could not believe the difference in fit and quality sorry but I won't be ordering these anymore. Much thinner smaller and elastic not covered.
"It is a nicely carved box but the red stain comes off easily.  Your hands turn red, clothes turn red, anything it touches will be stained.  I tried to wipe off a lot of the stain in hopes that would fix the problem but it forever stains."
This is a great looking boot but runs at least one size too big. I liked the tread on the bottom and the leather is really nice. Had to return because of size.
"They are SHOE STRETCHERS, not shoes!"
"The shoes seem rather stiff to wear for long periods of time. Hurt your feet, sole feels hard."
"After open the bag, very strong smell."
"As others have commented, this top is on the shorter side. It is also very form fitting. Although this is not the right top for me, it is a nice feeling material. But overall, I don't think it's worth the price."
"Too small, send them back"
"This 'Crew Neck Sweater,' from Hilfiger Denim is too small to be used as a sweater, except for someone of smaller size, although it has a nice look and the fabric is comfortable, too. And It appears to be put together nicely as well, with elastic waist and wrists. Made in China."
"It's a nice dress but not for a lady. It's for a young girl, very small young girl. I wear a large and I purchased an extra large and it was still too small."
"Very soft, very comfortable, a little too loose fitting"
"Zipper gets stuck A LOT, after walking in them for an hour, my ankles were sore from boots rubbing on them due to them being too big. Not happy with quality and will only wear them in extreme weather. They are NOT good on ice, as I fell a few times during last snowstorm. My Nike tennis shoes work better than these. They do keep my feet warm, but that's it."
This is very lightweight. Its good for those weird days in spring and fall when the temp is all over the place. The length is long enough to cover my backside. I am disappointed though that the zipper doesn't go the length of the jacket in the front. The zipper also breaks very easily but just unzip and redo. The hood does zip all the way up to my nose and the sleeves are belled to provide ample space for a sweater underneath.
This dress was very nice but too  large for my frame.  I purchased the medium.
"This dress is basically a sack with adjustable ties.  It actually looks cute, just did not work for me."
"The colors were much darker than the photo showed. Not what I expected. They were very nice, just to dark. However, they will be fine for my granddaughters. Just buy a couple chains and the two girls get to share all the pendants. You could also give as an individual gift for someone by just adding a chain."
"I am a big busted girl, but I've usually seen that scrubs run big, so I decided to go with my chances and ordered a small.
I should've known better, I honestly don't know what I was thinking when I ordered a small. I would need at least a large, but I knew that wouldn't work for me because the shoulder and waist area would be too big.
I couldn't even get the top to go past my breasts.
When I had my friend try it on, the scrub top looked nice. It's a very feminine cut with a nice and sturdy fabric.
Would recommend to petite girls or who prefer their scrubs a bit more fitted."
these shoes seem to run very large and I thought they would look more like a running or stylish shoe but they actually look like a golf shoe.  They are somewhat comfortable but seem to run a little large. They are OK but not sure I would purchase these again- there are a lot of other shoes that are more stylish than these.
"VERY cute boots. Nice and lightweight however not warm or waterproof at all. Not sure if we got a defective pair but our toddler got wet feet on a day when the snow was just starting to melt, even wetter feet the next week when there were puddles to stomp through."
"Cute top. Looks like it was well made just far to small for a ""large"""
Size 1x did not fit and I wear a size 18-20 top. Too tight around hips. Boxy does not flare for hips. Material a little thin but probably good for a sweaty workout. Wish it fit.
"This is super cute, but I doubt that it will last long. The clasp was near impossible to open and once I finally got it to budge, I could tell that it might not close properly. I expected lower quality for the price, but can't figure out why the clasp is so difficult to open."
"I wear a 38c & this bra was way too tight around my chest. To the point that it hurts to wear it, even for a short period of time. Sadpants."
Does fit. Cheaply made and turtleneck is very flimsy. No way near the other style sweater from alex stevens
It's big and the hood doesn't stay up well. But I get compliments on it and it keeps me dry. Definitely for warm weather though. Needs a fleece under it in cold weather.
"I don't typically give something less than a five star review. That being said, right out of the package a button was broken. I would suggest buying some metal buttons of the same size and sewing those on I'm place. I wear mediums for everything, this fits as if it's a large, I'm hoping it will shrink like others have stated. It is warm, and I like the feel of it. Just not the best quality. For the price I can't complain too much."
"The fabric and workmanship are beautiful but it's just too tight across the bust (38DD). This is the first Mordenmiss garment that I've had that problem with. Regretfully, I had to return it."
"The fit on these is somewhat haphazard. I ordered two more pairs recently because my old ones were worn through (more on that in a bit). . One pair is a little tight, the other pair is so tight it left deep grooves in the skin around my ankles. A shoe stretcher did the trick, but it shouldnt have been necessary. Theyre also not intended to be walked on. The cloth on the bottom is so thin it almost has only one side, and usually lasts just a few weeks before it's worn through. The slippers are nice and warm, but if I want them to last more than a few weeks, I have to glue fabric to the bottom with fabric glue to extend the life."
"just received my order and for some reason, my sole, stripe and metal loops, pictured as grey, are copper/gold! the shoes are cute, but i prefer grey on black. I'll keep 'em because i got them at the sales price, but if i paid the $109, they would be returned.

i have narrow feet and they do fit a bit snug. Order a half size up and forget about the color pictured."
"They're okay, but I expected more. The plastic seems flimsy and I hate that there isn't rubber on the ends; mine touch the plastic backing to my helmet and they tend to slide during my whole ride. Super annoying. Should have gone with the POC sunglasses."
Not a good fit for cup size.
"I gave 3 stars for the good quality, but this men's small is WAY small, like a women's small.  I wear a women's medium but like a men's for the roomier fit to sleep in.  One may want to bear this in mind when ordering."
"Like the bag,nice size but find it heavy with all that hardware"
"Very cute, being busty though it just did not work for me.  No support and made my chest area look weird!  Could not wear with bra."
"These sandals were supposed to be leather. Description states leather.

NOT leather.

They are a cheap suede leather-knockoff.

Not good."
Quality is not that great.  Vest is almost like foam.  Returned.
"I wear a 52 in my sport coats and suits and consequently bought the same size in this handsome double-breasted raincoat.  Because of the exadurated large size of the garment, I am going to try a
size  48 and hope for the best.  I'll post another review at that time.  sincerely, Jim

PS  JAB, do I have to pay for postage !!!??"
They are ok.  They work for about 20 minutes.
Purchased for my almost 12 year old who isn't overweight and he barely fits into them.  Can deal for this year but will not get 2 seasons out of them.  Warm and waterproof.
"I use these shoes as ""house-only"" slippers.  They are tight, hard to slip on, and squeak alot when I walk around.  The noise is problematic because I get up really early and have to take extra care to be quiet.  I picked them originally because they are sharp looking."
Much too long for me (which was expected) and a poor fit in the crotch. I think these jeans run a bit small.
It is cotton made in India. It is not thick as it looks in the photo. if you are looking for self design and a summer wear it is good.
Top of dress is a gab . Should be more formed fitting in the top other than that the dress is beautiful.  Love the split and embellishments.  Must iron or steam dress before wear because dress is delivered folded and in a bag 8.5x11.
"Knowing it was basically swimsuit material sewn in two places, I ordered anyway :)  and yes that's exactly what I got.

I actually think its super cute. I ended up not wearing it for the occasion I had in mind because it goes down SO LOW in the back, but I can definitely see this for a trip to Vegas.

I actually paired it with a lace bandeau so its not overly exposing. (but the bandeau will show on the back as well because the bottom of the shirt falls below bra level)"
"The tan color looked a bit cheaper than what I was expecting, given it was a Sam Edelman shoe. Other colors may look better."
"The material is see-thru.  It isn't as noticeable with darker colors like this, but I definitely wouldn't buy this brand/design in light colors.  I don't like the neckline.  I was expecting the v neck to give breathing room and go down about 5"" from the throat.  This doesn't.  It is 4""."
"The description says this is for a size 9 to 11 shoe, which is inaccurate. I wear a 10 and it was too small. Plus I felt the quality of the sock to be quite cheap"
"Cute shirt, fit pretty well and has held up through multiple wearings and washings."
not even close to being same material
Pretty cute for cotton panties.
"I must have not read the product description thoroughly enough, I tried a pair on and it felt as if I was wearing a tiny waist with big meaty legs. I'm taking the blame for this one, Dickies is a great company."
"Bought because my son's ears become infected easily and they were supposed to be stainless steel. These guages still caused infections. They are attractive, though for those without sensitive ears."
"I'm sure that these probably work great, but my 5 year old hated them.  We had a hard time getting her hands into them."
They were soft and nice but they are all to loose so i have to constatly adjust it so i don't wear them often
Nice but so fragile. The frame must be more elasticize.
Decent quality cargo pants. Order one size up on the waist. The inseam is a 32. I'm a 34 length so these will be returned.
"I am 5'9"" inches and 155lbs. I wear a 38 D and I feel this is not as fitted as I had hoped. I ordered a large. I am thinking it might shrink up a little. Looks way cuter on the chick in the picture :P"
"The waist is big & so these shift & need to be pulled back up a couple of times. It's not a huge deal to me, but I'm not sure that I'd buy them again."
Very cheap material extremely see through
My daughter is pretty true to an infant size 3 and when we received these they were way too big!  Hopefully they will fit next summer and we didn't waste our money when she wears this size in the winter time.
Not what I expected... Cute but not for me.
"I bought this dress a few weeks ago and was super excited to try it on when it came. The dress itself is adorable, simple but anybody can pull it off. I am a plus sized girl who carries most of my weight in my midsection and was ""gifted"" very small breasts for my size. Nearly everything I buy normally fits great or too big on my chest, but even this dress wouldn't fit over my chest. It was WAY too tight. It fit everywhere else great, but there is no way I was giving up breathing right just to look amazing haha. So unsurprisingly I returned it and got my refund, however I would love to buy it in a different size."
Not for diapers
"It was see through on the bottom half, I had to put a slip under so her legs wouldn't show. It was for the wedding and held up for the one day that it was needed for. Good luck finding a white slip for a 4 year old. Luckily my mom made one in time."
"I bought them for dental school, very comfortable and not too snug even with thicker socks.  However, I don't think I'd buy them again.  I recently got Dansko clogs to replace them and like the clogs much better."
"Wanted to rate 5 plus stars at first...
Came very quickly. Nice cute little box and they were taped not to fall.
They are pretty, elegant and sexy. Good quality as well....
BUT......
Was upset to notice a scratch on the center stone on one of them.......... You can see on the pictures...  That's why only 3 stars..."
"They were ok but the top was a little too long. So driving home I was very uncomfortable, the waist had folded over. It was comfortable other than that."
"The Kipling luggage alvar crossbody bag.
This is a nice durable nylon bag.  Perhaps the size of this bag would be ok for some people, but for me, the dimensions were like several inches smaller than expected.  I do carry many items in my bag constantly and it is too small.  I quit using this bag after a while because of the size.  It has several pockets which is very accommodating and quality is good."
Very short in the torso
do not last long. I prefer GAP
"It was a nice pants fit me a bit big I'm 5'0 91 pounds I guess its meant for a girl with more meat. If your skinny like me its not gonna look good on you, you need some booty which I sadly do not have. Lol."
"Buckle not smooth operating, belt material bit light weight. expect buckle to wear in and work good."
"Have this same shoe in another color.  BUT, this time around, they do not fit as well.  Also, thought the color was hot pink and it is more purplish than pink."
"I liked the shoes, but they felt narrower than I like in the toe area. Would have ordered a size up, but wasn't available. Returned."
"The first shirt I got came in the mail with a black stain on the back shoulder. I contacted the seller and they told me to just keep it and they would send me out a new one... which they did. So.. that I really appreciate. They were prompt with sending me out a replacement.

However... even though that part was nice... when I got the shirt and tried it on I couldn't believe how tight it is in the HIPS. It's strange. It's like its fine everywhere else.. the arms... the neck.. but the hips are unbelievable tight. And I look at other reviews that say the same thing. It must just be how this shirt is made. Other than that... a nice shirt."
Cute flip flops and really confy footbed but the picture showed a backstrap and these did not have a backstrap.  So I am returning them but I wanted others to be aware.  Size 1-2 youth have no backstrap and if your childs toes are short like mine they just can't keep flip flops on without something on the back.
great shorts but very disappointed that all pockets sketchers had to be resewed
I wear a 14/16 dress and ordered 3x but mason canceled my order as it became out of stock. Ordered a 2x and it fit well everywhere except it was too tight in the chest.
Good for price but order two sizes up at least
"The watch is ok.  I worn it about 4 times since I bought it, but the extra step to hit the side button to see the time shown in the digital display is not helpful.  Often when people look at their watches it is at a 'quick glance', especially if you don't want to let other folks know you're checking the time. You want to be subtle when checking your time on your wrists because other people may read you as impatience or bored or both.  Using your other hand to activate the watch display would definitely do you that disfavor.  I have over 40 other watches of different shapes and sizes and colors, so this one would be those few I would drop in the time capsule of my 2ndary watch cases, never to be worn again. Btw, I also bought the black color metal one, and it's same deal.  Just thought you may want to consider this before buying it, unless you like to keep unused things in a wooden chest for keepsakes purpose only."
I like these pants but they could use more room in the legs.
Nice style and sizing. Material very clingy showing any imperfections you may have. Not flattering for fuller figures.
"Absolutely beautiful necklace & bracelet set! My 2 year old daughter loved hers but unfortunately she broke it after wearing it for about 30 minuets. The end where the clasp is came loose from the thick plastic string its strung on. I don't know if it was loose when we received it, but most likely she pulled on it while wearing it because she is used to wearing the break-away necklaces. If your looking to purchase a necklace (& your child isn't rough like mine is), this is a beautiful set. I will probably purchase another one and put it up until she gets a little older!"
the one I ordered might have been a little too large but even if it was 2 sizes smaller it wouldn't fit very well. You will need to modify this for it to fit properly.
does straps around the foot area are a little bit large did not return just sitting in my closetwe'll add it this review if I give this shoe to my daughter and she likes it
Not as comfortable as I had expected this saucony shoe to be.
They do look cool but the lenses are thin cheap plastic. Also made for a larger head.
The wings are nicer than the ones with the wire frames.  The finger hole broke after the 2nd use but it was easy to fix even with limited sewing abilities.  I don't know if this is typical or we received a badly made set.  Bonus - glitter effect without actual glitter all over the place.
Love the simplicity of the design. Material kind of itchy. And sizing with this brand seems inconsistent. I wanted the XL snug but not THIS snug. :-(
"The band is difficult to get over my head.  I'm wearing 34 DD, and the large seems to be a bit too small."
"I usually wear an XL in Lindy Bop, but ordered a 2X to be safe.  The bust was still too small.  Also, the pointy bits on the bust that make the neckline so unique are floppy.  I expected them to be stiffened, boned, or padded.  The material is nice and heavy, and the color is beautiful."
Looked good but too tight for my son.
"Not comfortable at all, material is itchy."
"The bra part fit kinda funny, the colors and quality is amazing but the pants also do t go as high as presented to be, I'm 200 pounds 5 foot 5 inches tall 36C in bras and it fit funny"
"It's got a heathered look to it, so if you are buying it for a Velma costume, it will not work."
"Light shoes, not much too them. I usually wear a 9 so I ordered a 9.5 but they were still really snug. These would be great for running barefoot without socks. With socks, just too snug for me."
3 stars cuz I just don't know yet....was surprised by the tongue. It's connected to the top of heel area. Kinda floats there. It didn't hinder me from getting it on...it stretches. We'll see..
"I bought the size based on the guidelines on the box and the bra is very, very small. But maybe the only way it can provide any support is if it is very tight/small. And it does provide more support than I expected from something with no metal, no wires and no elastic. I wouldn't wear it to the office or with dressy clothes, but it is very comfortable for a casual bra."
"It was a very nice looking dress, but my daughter found it too restrictive in the shoulders and across the bust (while putting it on). I think that it should have a slit in the back of the neckline with a button or zipper to make it easier to slip on and off.
It is also straighter in cut than it appeared on the model."
"They are quite comfortable, but I'm a little disappointed in how they make my butt look flatter than it is. Given these are supposed to be rave shorts I'd assumed they would enhance rather than detract. The fabric is beautiful though, so maybe people won't notice."
"They run small and on my pair, the glue was visible between the shoe and the platform. If they had fit properly, I would have overlooked it. But they didn't so, I had give them away as it wasn't worth trying to send them back. I told myself that if I kept wearing them, maybe I could break them in a bit...but you can't break in plastic."
"Overall the dress looks pretty good on, it's very flattering, but it is made of cheap fabric that is super see-through."
"Very cute, but after a few hours my feet were hurting.  Had to send them back."
"Decent shirt, nothing to rave about."
"Runs small, but I can wear it.  My husband says tight is alright!"
"Way too small, uncomfortable around my thighs"
"The bag is bigger than it seems online, and it is so soft-sided that it is hard to dig around in it without using two hands. The quality is still very good, color very nice."
"I was excited to receive this puffy vest because quite a few commenters said it ran small. I did not feel as though that was the case when it came to me. I am very petite and was swimming in this vest. I am always a size xsmall in women's clothing but got the small because so many reviewers said it ran small. Well I am here to tell you that the sizes run normally. Get your size! If you're on the fence, pick whichever is the best for you and make sure to purchase a product that is from Amazon, so if it doesn't fit, you can send it back for the correct sizing."
They keep my feet dry but they rub my ankles. But I will keep them because I need something to keep my feet dry when I feed the animals
"I know that Vaneli shoes tend to fit a bit small, but I have a size 10M wedge and it fit me, so I thought that a lower heel would fit better.  This shoe requires a breaking in period, and because of the tapered toe, it might be best to go a half-size up.  I put in shoe stretch and wore for about 1 hour, at the end of that time, the left foot was comfortable, but the right foot needed more stretching.  Surprisingly, I had a problem with the padding in the sole in the right shoe, it didn't seem to be the same as the left shoe since the ball of my foot was hurting after one hour and I was just walking inside the house - no rough surfaces.

I tried out the shoes again after leaving the right shoe to stretch for 24 hours with one re-application of stretching liquid in between, and while it fits more comfortably, there definitely seems to be less padding in the sole.  The rubber sole is about the thickness on what the leather soles normally are - maybe 1/8 of an inch or less.

The shoe though looks very good and makes your foot look very neat.  The color is a sort of metallic bronze brown."
"Fit perfect, but the pull-over top is hard to get on and off with the floating pieces inside.  It would be better if the zipper in the back went all the way down, and came on like a vest, rather than a pull-over.

The floating pieces inside are a little weaker than other swim suits like this.  Kids have to swim, they cannot just float around.  Which can be a good thing if you are teaching to swim."
"not nearly as large as they say the purse is. but it is very pretty. I wanted to use it as an over night bad. but, it is just an ordinary purse."
A little tricky to get on not exactly the same as the picture but still very cute and wearable
"I love the look of these shoes, but unfortunately I will be returning them. They are pretty narrow in the toe area making them uncomfortable.  I was surprised by this because I even ordered them a bit bigger than my normal size."
Looks nice but the fabric is kind of cheap.
"I liked the look of this, but it is nowhere long enough to tie as pictured.  I have a small head and not much hair, and it would barely go around and knot, much less tie in a large fluffy bow.  They are misrepresenting this product."
"It doesn't look like what you see in the picture. I was expecting something that was slightly distressed looking and the blue a bit darker. However, the shirt came in a true bright blue. It's not bad, just not what I was expecting."
"Serve the purpose I bought them for, I wear them at home and they are comfortable. But they do not have the support other mules/ clogs have (see soft walk or Skechers)."
this cloth does work although it leaves a mess on your hands! beware! I am not sure if all jewlry cloths are this messy or not.
"I received this product less than a week ago in a bubble wrap envelope. There was some leakage around the cap and the plunger had broken off of the lid so that it couldn't be fixed. Most of the contents were still in the bottle so I tried it on my face. It's a slimy feeling product and I haven't seen any improvement or change in my complexion yet. If anything, it's a little drier than before, which I don't need. It states on the box that results should be seen in 8 days. I'm going to continue to use it for awhile and will update if I have anything to add.

I don't know if the product froze and broke the cap or if it was broken due to poor packaging. Too be safe, I would not recommend ordering this if you live in a freezing climate in the winter. I don't know if freezing would or could effect the product's effectiveness either, but it was left on my doorstep for a few hours, as most deliveries are."
"The reason for 3 stars is when I got the item, its left elbow was dirty. Means it wasn't new as I expected and as the web site announced."
Runs a sz smaller then normal.  Really thin material.  The design and color is nice.  Also really short for taller women.
Gave to a friend who is about 5 sizes smaller than me!  She loved them.
I've only worn once. Didn't fit true to size.  Hurts my feet.
"these are super cute, obviously, and the fuzzy stuff feels just wonderful on bare feet. but i'd purchased these thinking i could wear them on chilly days with socks and that's not gonna work - these are sized kind of small and i couldn't even get my foot inside with a sock on (i wear 7.5/8s in nearly everything and 39s in euro sizing). i also felt like the difference between the heel height and platform (under the ball of the foot) was too much and would end up being uncomfortable. if the platform height had been a bit higher i might've tried these in a size up, but no point. too bad. i love these!"
Love the design of this but it is sized way too small. Almost always wear a small or medium and ordered a medium in this but it is way too tight -- can hardly get it on. Order big.
"Pros: Quality Materials, Comfortable (for walking in)
Cons Difficult to put on, stiff

I've had these a few weeks and worn several times now, but they're still really hard to pull on. The band around the ankle isn't very flexible and I end up having to twist and turn my feet and the shoes trying to slide them on. Once on though, the shoes are plenty roomy. The arch is a little high (I have a very average arch height), but for walking around in, I think these are the most comfortable shoes I own, maybe because they are so roomy.
I would still probably consider buying another pair if they were at a reduced price, but not worth regular price to me."
"After reading other reviews I ordered these in a size up from my normal pant size, regular length. And so I was disappointed to find that the overalls are still tight across my stomach and are very short. The picture on the ad is actually very accurate. You have to make the straps as long as possible to keep the pants from riding up, and the cuffs will still barely touch your ankles. And having the bib so low means that the buttons line up with my, ahem, chest area in a bizarre way that draws attention I'd rather not have. The blue is also more on the purple side than the indigo side, and the hips and legs are very wide and roomy. The material seems to be of decent quality, hence three starts. I bought this mainly to wear around the house, so I will keep them, but there's no way I would be comfortable wearing these anywhere else."
"Kind of a strange little pocket-knife for someone to carry around, as it's really just a tiny manicure kit.  Basically, it has a tiny-tiny knife, a tiny nail file and a tiny screwdriver, a tiny scissor, and the only notable tool is the fold out nail clipper.  All of this in Swiss-army red configuration about the size of an extra-thick thumb drive.  It's actually kind of bulky because it is thicker than most pocket knives this size.

My question is why someone would opt for this over a regular nail clipper - most small nail clippers are no bigger than this but work better, as they are not shrunk down to fit in the red plastic housing.  AND, it's pretty easy to find clippers that have a nail file (sometimes even a knife) built in.  If you really need a nail clipper on you at all times you could do better.  And if you need a pocket knife and scissor on your key chain, it's pretty easy to get one in that will give you more knife and scissor in a thinner package.

BUT, all that being said, there is nothing wrong with how this tool works.  It's kind of handy - the knife can cut open a box or an envelope, the scissors can open a snack pack or cut off a loose thread, and I actually used the scredriver today to tighten a loose joint on a lamp.  They are all comically small though, and are clumsy to use.

Really, if you have the nail scissors I wonder why you need the nail clippers too."
These were ok but not quite as pretty as I had hoped and the backs don't stay on well.  They were for my daughter whose birthstone is Topaz.  Disappointing.
Gloves were a little small and not a comfortable as I hoped.
Nice look.
They do the job of keeping the beads from coming off but you really need a locking bead over it to look better. The plastic by itself does not look that great.
"Looks more like a sweater than I expected. I've had it for a while now, and the overall feel is less sway team and more sweater with pockets. It was a little tight, and it has shrunk a bit, so you might want to order a little bigger. It's an okay shirt."
When I got these boots I was in love! They're so cute and comfy and cozy! I didn't wear them too often because they're a little too casual for work. After a little over a month I went to put them on and noticed I could see light in the left boot! Further investigation showed the whole left side of the boot came loose from the sole! :-( I'm sending them back and contemplating buying another pair - with such great reviews mine had to be defective. Although my pair fell apart I can only subtract 2 stars because I miss them already!
The Taupe colour and overall look of the shoe is nice.  But the comfort you would expect from Nine West is lacking.  The shoe is hard and narrow. I am not a fan of having to break in shoes.
"I wear a size 7 or 7.5 shoe, and these socks are just barely small enough for me to wear. They're definitely a little roomy on me and seem more like low-cut rather than no-show, but they are wearable (although putting on shoes tends to pull the heel of the sock upwards if I'm not careful).  Maybe I'll try putting them through a hot wash cycle to see if I can shrink them at all.

Other than the size, they are quite cushiony and very warm (which I might appreciate more in different weather)."
"I was looking for something a little lighter, it is a heavy very nice flannel.
It would be just too warm for me."
"I wear Medium for everything, except for this. I read as many reviews as I could and a lot said these ran small and yes they do. I'm 6'0"" 180 lbs, definitely should have gone with a large. These work well, keeps me warm, I just have to wear it underneath a long sleeve shirt."
"I bought this hat for my boyfriend because he has kind of a big head, and I've been recommended Timberland hats as they're apparently supposed to fit bigger heads well.

As it turns out, that was not the case. My boyfriend, touched by the gesture,  insisted upon trying to get the hat to fit around his head. It was like trying to fit a watermelon inside of a rubber glove.  While he did succeed, it's just a smidge too small for a guy with a slightly larger than average noggin. I wouldn't say this hat is ""one size fits all""."
"Nice thick shirt good quality however it was huge.  Ordered large,  fit like x large"
This coat runs small
I ordered a size 8.5 but it rubs the back of feet and squeezes my toes. Wore it once and gave up on it.
"As a member of the overly well endowed club I am forever in search of a bra that holds the girlies in and is somewhat cute. This isn't that bra, I'm always falling out of it, and I did order my correct size. So frustrating.."
"My daughter is tall for her age and has been wearing 18 month old clothing before she turned a year old.  The pants are much longer than pants from Gymboree or Carters for the same age range.  The socks are cute as is the onesie (which seems to fit the same as other brands).  The colors are not too bright and the price was quite affordable when I purchased this.  However, the orange pants had a rather large hole in the seam.  It's easy to fix, but I shouldn't have to fix brand new clothing.  This is the third time clothing I've ordered from Amazon has had a hole in it or some other defect.  Makes me wonder if this is not outlet shopping and that I should just start to expect lower quality."
"This has an elastic band around the inside, which keeps is in place (mostly).  Seems mostly well made.  Worked good as a costume hat."
The color is nice and the fit is slightly smaller than expected. Also the toe of both shoes is sunken a little. Other thatln that these are ok.
"Quality has gone down a bit, they are not the same as the ones before . I still have a set of the thicker ones."
"buckles are WAAAAAY to big, everytime I sit down it catches on the chair or scrapes wooden benches and chairs. Its embarrassingly, poorly  designed, but it keeps my pants up and isn't that what its all about? lol"
"Wear 7s normally, need 6.5s as these 7s are quite large on me. Exchange process initiated."
Beautiful just to big for my needs.
It is a nice dress but if you are not thin the cut is not too flattering. The material is thick. The slit is very high so I would suggest wearing with leggings or opaque tights. I like the dress it just didn't make me look good so I returned it. For the price it is nice and looks classy.
"I like how they look, but i don't like how i see in them."
These boots look cute and that's about as far as they go. I needed water proof snow boots. I originally was trying to save some money but once I got the boots I realized these were not going to last very long.  Made from a plastic faux  leather. It looks like they will rip and tear easily. Bought a size 10 for my size 9.5 feet and they fit perfectly no socks on. So I think they run a little small? I did like how lightweight they felt. In the end I returned these and paid $75 for a pair of Polo water proof boots.
"I've been wanting these earrings since seeing a similar design in a catalog years ago.  I love their unique, edgy look and how easy they are to put in my ears.  A couple of problems with these though:  #1, the silver is very soft and bends easily (misshaping the earring), and #2, they slide out of my ears easily.  In hindsight, I should have spent a little more on a better quality silver.  As far as the earring slipping through the hole in my ear lobe, I guess I could use those rubber thingies, but those will show and defeats the intended appearance of the earrings."
Very comfortable but there is a fuel-like smell. The smell did not wash out in my first washing. I bought these leggings to keep me warmer in the winter. Maybe I will be able to burn them to use as an emergency heat source if the power goes out. I purchased mine from Newport Blvd.
I like the bracelet but the length is short for a man.
"Fit a little loose on top and I don't really care to much for the material, it's ok for the price."
Nice looking bra but way small. 34D looked like a 32A/B at best.
My husband has a tiny waist/butt and I got him a Large which he usually wears.  It is VERY small (but he can still wear them as a joke)....
"Nothing great, lately been disappointed with jewelry from Amazon!"
Very basic implementation of this traditional style. Not very stylish or flexible.
I have been looking for a cross that isn't too heavy or gaudy. This definitely fits the profile. I love it.
"The vest is cute!  The color is great!

But it is very short, and very wide...so it just did not fit my son's body, at all."
"Arrived with a cracked crystal. Not packed well. Crystal broke and cannot be replaced, since it seems to be special."
I hate the material! The cut is very cute/flattering but the material is wretched!
"Comfort is very enjoyable i.e. nice bounce & support. Unfortunately, threading is coming loose already from the front & right side of the right shoe. Otherwise I would purchase again."
"OK.  Does the job.  Compact.  I prefer more cotton blend.  Color is more like cream, not pure white."
Read before buying there from china. Love the leggings they fit well but it has this weird smell I would wash them but don't put them in the dryer or they would shrink they came early which was nice. :)
"It is not what I would have bought if they had my favorite bag design in a fabric I liked.  This is quite small and won't hold much.  Like all VB bags the construction quality is excellent.  I'm not crazy about the strap which is quite stiff, hoping it will soften up over time."
Unfortunately the handbag is being returned.  It was too big and had no structured bottom...it just flopped when put down.  The shoulder strap was shorter than I thought. I loved the color but just not the handbag.
"It's larger than a regular check book.  If you wanted something to carry in your pocket on a regular basis, I don't recommend it.
If it's just kept at home, it does the job."
"Great style and color. A little on the wide side. Not as much arch support as I expected; however, I would recommend."
"These boots are absolutely adorable and I wanted them even more in person than in the picture.  However, I wear a 7 1/2 medium and though I ordered an 8 after reading other reviews, this boot was so tight I could barely get it on. I had to send it back.  I don't think even ordering a 9 would have helped since it is also very narrow.  Sigh.  They sure are cute."
"Love the outlook, slim, simple and elegant but it was slightly tight, and the high ankle was not easy to move around. Zipper works very well.

I bought another pair of Madden Girl boots, only $25, cheap and so comfy to wear!"
The jacket is not made symmetrical. WHile I love the way it fits me I had to re sew one of the shoulders as it had too much fabric compared to the other shoulder. Overall for the price I can't complain...but make the shoulders more symmetrical.
"It's a decent wallet, my main complaint is that the fabric tears away and ID cards get stuck where you can't readily pull them out."
"It's a down booty so of course there is no arch support, don't take that as a negative just a factual part of the product.  I tell you what, I guess they are warm but the design is the strangest I have ever seen/felt.  They have an oddly pointed tow... Why?  Kind of a bit tighter on the ankle and a strange spread of down.  I wish I could explain it better.  Suggested use is this, in a sleeping bag, on the couch or recliner for an extended time or bed, not for walking around."
The bulk of the socks are very good.  Mid-weight and cotton-rich.  The problem for me is the elastic which becomes very binding and irritating as the day wears on.  I am hoping the socks loosen up a bit.
"It's cute, but something is wrong with the proportions and the fit is off."
A little tight across the top but will probably stretch out during the summer and since they fit well otherwise I'm keeping them plus they are really cute!
The underwire is very uncomfortable but otherwise it's a good nursing bra.
"The receiving blankets are too small and very light weight fabric.  Better for burp cloths, and the clothes, also very lightweight are good for a very short time, the images are decals,not sewn in...."
One side of the owls head was lose from the body. There was a gap in the link attaching it. The link also doesnt seem too sturdy.
I think these are Hanes' older version - the elastic on which is a bit too tight.
Didn't hold up very long. Not as good as I thoughtit would be. With in a couple of months it started to fall apart.
"Nice heavy thick material. More texture than Im used too with skirts like this but sturdy feeling non the less..... if it fit. Ive bought a bunch of these types of skirts from various sellers an so far all the xxls fit tight and the xxxls fit fine but this xxxl did not zip all the way up, it is much too small even with the partial elastic waistband."
"These are alright products but not exactly what I expected. I bought the color ""ERB1B03A"" thinking it was white, but it's definitely a light grey. And the part that tucks into the collar is much bigger than expected. Not a bad ascot but I needed white for this and I can't use the grey."
"These boots are difficult to get on because there is no zipper or anything. If you're wearing these with leggings you should be ok, but if you plan on wearing these with jeans THINK AGAIN!"
"I purchased these leggings to wear with long sweaters and long boots, so I can make it work. The fabric is all stretch material, and is without any noticeable ""seat"" space, similar to a new pair of pantyhose.  The zipper detail is nice, the material is comfortable, and the waistband is high, so it will work with long bulky tops."
"blisters. lots of reviews mentioning blisters, and it seems to be a problem."
"I love Keens and these are cute sandals but I don't find them supportive or comfortable, rather they don't hurt- thats true. The foot bed is thin which I kind of like, it reminds me of being barefooted which I like. But I wore them on a 5 mile walk and by the end one of my knees hurt and both my legs because I think they don't have enough support for me.  I dealt with their lack of arch support for my high arches with stick on arches, and that helps and the fact that they can't be adjusted I dealt with by sticking heel pads on the back strap ( I cut them in half horizontally and they are sticking well- It helps to take up that bit of extra room on the back strap.) With all the alterations I did on these sandals they are okay, I'll wear them to work sometimes at when I won't be doing a lot of walking."
"the only problem with Crocs is its sizing, cant follow standard sizing, you have to try it out physically at a store department before ordering online."
"My husband liked them but  they were about 1 in too tight for me. I bought a medium and I weight 145lbs. They are high waisted fit, with a tad bit tight waist. They felt like a tight g-string to say the least."
"<div id=""video-block-R3DUKU1RQOWVDA"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1DvCKeY0LS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ja1N0oPVS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply don't understand why shoe manufacturers are obsessed with putting raised branding labels on the inside heels of shoes.  Especially orthotic shoes meant primarily for heel pain.  You can hardly pick up a pair of mens shoes without some raised heel pad with the company log on it.  I am not sure that any of them have figured out that these heel pads are the exact opposite of heel comfort.  They should be heel depressions!  These sandals are no different.  New Balance decided to emboss a raised ""NB"" right in the center of the heel. Why, for what purpose?  These are for heel pain , so why add raised letters dead center on the heel that are extremely noticeable and quite annoying when wearing them.

But I digress. I have no doubt that if I were an American Indian my name would be Tender Foot.  My feet are very delicate and I can try on 25 pairs of shoes to get to one pair thats comfortable.  As I get older my heel pain has become much worse and its very difficult to find the right shoe, insert or sandal.  Especially since I have wide feet 10 (EE). No one makes wide sandals so I make due as they eventually stretch out.

These are sold as arch forming and they certainly are.  Much better support than any sandal I have come across.  The foot strap is tight as can be seen in the attached image. But on my feet all sandals are tight until they straps loosen up. These insoles are highly textured which I really don't care for.  I like smooth insoles, not hundreds of bumps.  I get it that they are made not slide off your feet when wet.  But these are unusually highly textured.

I know this sounds strange given the comments above, but I will probably keep them. My old sandals are completely shot and I don't want to make sandal shopping for a single summer a summer long project.  I plan to sand off (remove) the raise NB letters completely as I could never wear them the way they are.  I have no doubt the straps will stretch out and I may even sand down the bumpy insoles slightly if they are too annoying.

Bottom line: They fit true to size (minus those with fat feet) and they do have good arch support.  But hey could much better with some very minor changes. I am keeping them, but would not order them again."
Picture of the shoe was much nicer than what these actually are.  Seem to be an inexpensive type of leather (if they are leather).  And they have very thin footbed.  I need much more than that in my shoes.  I'm returning these.
Very comfortable but has a more old lady shoe look when worn than I anticipated.
"I love the pattern and the fit is ok, but the fabric is SUPER lightweight and pretty see through. I was hoping to wear these to work, but it seems like they'll be more appropriate for pajama pants, unfortunately."
Very uncomfortable style!
"I'm large this dress fit like a M, but look nice, just the pads that I don't like because move or around ..."
Runs a bit small compared to other Cherokee tops. I do think the material is much nicer than the typical Cherokee tops.  This also washes really nicely and does not wrinkle much
waist a little small
"Sleeves somewhow fit short, compared to overall size.."
"this is why 3 stars. at a local nursery, i can find a better hat (arguably better) for less money.  a lot less money.
with a better selection at the nursery. bummed me out."
Product is way too small and sized wrong on the website. Thank you fir the quick refund.
These are adorable but don't stay on
"Nothing special, fit just like ones from Wal Mart."
"As a tall woman with large feet and athletic calves, but otherwise not overweight, I am ridiculously frustrated in my quest to replace my beloved, Walmart (yes, I said Walmart), tall gardening boots. This boot was the closest I have come so far, but it is still too narrow for my wide-toe, regular-otherwise size 11 feet. The other problem is the footbed in these boots seemed to curve up to meet my heel - very uncomfortable. And the kicker? They aren't accomodating enough to allow for my super-sensitive since foot surgery bone spur area on the top of my left foot. The surgeon promised it would be happy again six weeks after surgery; in December it'll be 6 years. Ugh.

The calves were wide enough, however - hooray! That's a rarity. I am waiting on yet another Amazon rain boot to come in so I can hopefully get a pair that fits. These went back."
"Fast shipping, appeared to be slightly used, more of a costume shoe not comfortable for hours on end. Works for my pole dancing class though."
"These flip flops are beautiful!  the bright rainbow colour really attracts attention.  The only thing is that because the platform is so thick, your feet are left feeling very tired at the end of the day.  It feels as though you are lugging around extra weights on your feet.  Also, after some hard use, the strap that fits between my big toe and pointer toe completely broke.

Great buy for once and a while easy walking but not for all day, hard walking use."
"If your elementary school kid likes wheeled bags, with the option to convert to a backpack when needed, this is a great bag to get.

The overall quality of this bag is on the low. I was expecting slightly better quality given its price. Listed at $80, it has always been on sale at $44.99. So I paid about $45 + $6 shipping + tax. Although I have Prime, when I ordered it in August 2015, it was not offered through Prime.

The handle (perhaps the most important part of this bag) looks cheap plastic. Although it has been holding okay so far, I have serious doubts it will survive much longer.

The best feature (that the kids will love) are the light-up wheel. I actually didn't know that they lit up until after the bag arrived so it was a nice surprise.

There is a lunch bag is thrown in like an extra freebie. Its definitely not worth it. First, its not insulated and second, it does not stay closed. The only good thing about the lunch bag is that it matches the bag.

If quality is utmost important and you want a bag that will last a year or more, then this is not the right bag. However, I searched (mostly on Amazon) but could not find many other similar bags that are this size (i.e. for kids)."
"Love the color and design, bottoms fit, top not even close. I wish it did because i think it would be so sexy."
"Material is seems a little cheap but good for the price. This product does run large, I bought a small and it was big on me."
These run smaller than expected and the fabric is stiff and feels cheap.
Not fancy but comfy. Not the usual Nine West quality
"Earings were ""lost"" in the mail so came late. They are very pretty but fell apart after a few months."
"I presume that in the right size, these shoes would be great. They arrived and they are just too small. I would buy the size up but they are strangely twice the price here on Amazon. I returned these and did not order  again."
So light it is a bit unsettling.  I use it as a backup for the next time I lose my tungsten ring...
"I was surprised at how small these seemed. They fit, but barely. This pack had Medium at 30-32 waist. My previous packs had medium at 32-34 waist. Not sure if they changed the medium range at some point or what, but an interesting discrepency. I also wonder if it has something to do with the ""new low rise fit"" they are boasting about.  I used to love fruit of the loom becuase they were made of thicker material than others I had tried, and lasted longer as a result. Not any more. Looks like cost pressure has changed these to the same thin material as other briefs. I can't speak to longevity yet, but they are thin."
Love the color - love the look but the lenses are really too small to block out light for driving as I had hoped. Wish they made them bigger like sunglasses - if they were bigger I'd give them five stars for sure.
"Material is kind of cheap looking. Kind of wished I had sent them back, but I've worn them a few times. They aren't uncomfortable."
the other 3 pair I own fit my narrow foot these are really wide
"I love the look but the toe box was too tight and, since this isn't made of natural materials, I am not sure it would stretch to be comfortable. Might size up."
"I bought size 3X and I usually wear 2X (Lane Bryant) or 3X (Old Navy) active shirts.  When I'm standing normally, the shirt looks fine.  Pretty light weight material but that doesn't matter since it'd be a shirt for the gym.  When I put my arms up, it raises up so high you can see my belly.  I wear my workout pants pretty high to hold in the belly jiggle, but you can still see skin when my arms are up.  For me, being plus size, that's no good especially when I have standing overhead exercises to do!  I was hoping it was longer-waisted but I'm thinking it just looks that way on the model.  The ""wow pink"" color was great, I loved that."
"Soft and warm, but gets fuzz balls all over the place."
"REALLY wanted to love these. As other described, they are not very comfortable. Too narrow in my opinion. They look great...until you put them on."
"I really wanted to love these. Super cute design, and we generally have good luck with hatley quality. I ordered a size 7 - and they the pants were a similar length to some Hanna Andersson Size 110 (6) PJs but the waist was about 2 inches wider! No way will this work for my skinny kid. That seems odd compared to other Hatley PJs we have had in the past. But perhaps why they were marked down so much... :("
"I like the concept of the top.  It is pretty, but it was super tight and it you are a thick girl it isn't flattering on the muffin top (even a little one).  Company has been really great so far with the return process.  Just waiting for it to get back to them for my refund."
"Cute but not durable or quality.  Just cute...(Top is a tad short so if you have a long torso, this may not be the shirt for you).

I'm a L size and XL would probably fit a little better."
"I rec'd and they look kind of dorkey. Glue can be seen on side. Set them back, next day. Love the color and lace up. Tip of boot just looked too dorkey."
Cute shoe. Love the adjustable straps but a little narrow for me. I returned these and replaced with Alegrias
"Given the cost, I never expected these socks to last only one wearing. They run worse than panty hose and they are expensive for a one time wear. They are cute though."
"This hat is is a little small,the quality,appears to be good so far."
I do not blame my purchase.  The measurements were wrong and I ended up with shape wear too large.
Only a few of them glow in the dark which is kind of stupid since they say glow in the dark.
"I do like the general looks of this watch but after wearing it for a day, ultimately had to return to. The main reason: the day/date indicators easily go out of sync. The only way to change the a day/date is to manually turn the clock forward (or backward) by 24 hours. When you do so, the day and date both move by 1 day as well. The problem is, if the day/date is off cycle, then to get it on cycle, it would potentially take many turns of the clock, additionally, it's easy to get off cycle as the months are different lengths so you have to remember to reset the day/date each month. I could just ignore the day/date indicators but I hate having nonfunctional ""vanity"" dials on a watch.

Also, it's a really heavy watch and has a higher profile on the wrist making it catch when I reach into coat pockets etc."
"Mine was somewhat to small,  came with adjustable pads, which I do not care for, I like the bra's without pads, and did not realize that the bra's I ordered came with pads, but over all an O.K bra."
"The clasp/button is pretty big. I ended up just cutting the elastic to length, then on the top eyelet, I threaded it in from the outside and tied a knot on the inside so the plastic ""hardware"" is useless to me."
"i have a champion top black, now i have ordered the red one, and it's too small :("
"Not overly fond of these bras.  They do fit well, but one side has the underwire sewn in to the point I had to put padding over the end because it kept poking my underarm.  They are much less comfortable than other Curvation bras I have purchased in the past."
no contour on  rear ;-/
It's pretty and good fabric. But it's so short. I'm a size 16/18 so I order a 2x. It's cute to wear with black jeans. Also it's very see through. Need to wear a white Tank top under it.
The material is not as thin as the Arrow Poplin wrinkle free shirt but the collar is to broad. The collar doesn't seem to fit correctly as the Arrow Poplin shirt. Plus there are loose threads. The finish/quality isn't correct.
"Its very cool, but looks not very sturdy. And difficult to latch. I still like the style and it's fun to wear!"
I have shrink to fit 501s that are size 30w34l and the waist is getting too tight. I bought these pre-shrunk but was not prepared for how much different they are from shrink to fit. First I bought 32w34l and they are enormous. Then I bought 31w34l and they are really too big. Just a heads up for anyone using their current jeans to choose a size: the difference between pre-shrunk and shrink to fit is dramatic.
So I got these thinking they would be a neat normal sized round pair of sunglasses however the glasses are huge compared to usual round glasses like this. Its a bit ridiculous and I do not plan on wearing them seriously. Maybe as a costume but they are too ridiculous to wear normally.
"Nice looking, and the length & width were fine, but the elastic collar was stretched out on both shoes, causing them to flop around. Returned for a refund."
okay. probably get the same from a dollar store though.
The bow fell off in the wash the very first time it was worn. I had to sew it back on (It was only hot glued). It is a cute outfit.
"I needed this for a Poison Ivy costume and it worked. The material is not soft, but kinda scratchy, sort of like a linen weave. The color is true to the picture and size wise it worked just fine. It is basically just a long piece of fabric that you tie. I think that it would for most people as it is quite large. If you were very small the tie part would just hang longer. It would work well at the beach or pool if you were looking for a sarong. It is see thru though."
"The bangs hung down into my eyes even when I set the front of the cap way behind my hairline, so I had to trim the bangs, and this plastic hair does not cut as evenly as real human hair.  The way it hangs looks off kilter.  One side curls in like in the picture; the other side flips out in a most unattractive way.  I don't know if that can be solved.  The color and fit are okay."
"I prefer Nike over any other brand of running shoes because they seem to fit and support my feet better than other brands. That being said, these really don't fit that well. I'm hoping I can break them in since I'm sure it's probably too late to return them but normally, I don't have to break my Nikes in. I'm a little dissapointed in this pair I have to admit."
"The 3 star rating is a reflection on the product, not the seller.  The jeans were priced right and arrived in reasonable time and in good condition ... even shippers can't break bluejeans ....
Elite Hero seems genuinely concerned that the customer is happy and makes efforts to ensure that.  No complaints there.
My only complaint concerns the Dickies product and is as follows....
This are not the Dickies Carpenter Jeans you may have been used to.  These seem to be a ""new"" version of the original carpenter jeans they've been making for years but the right leg side pockets are much smaller, and they no longer use rivets on the front pockets. I bought some locally prior to ordering these, and had the same problem.  I was hoping these would be different, but they aren't. I don't know if they will have the longevity of the original 1993SNB's, but I definitely will have to look for something else if I can't find the originals since the new right leg pockets are so small, they won't even fit my cell phone.  Still made in Mexico, but not what I was expecting. It's hard to get the value from a dollar like we used to, and that is no fault of the seller."
"I ordered these boots and the stitching on one boot was really off, so I had them replaced. The exchange was really easy, however, these boots are not too much better. I am not able to try and return them for a quality pair as they no longer have my size. I am not going to return them because I need boots ASAP and my only other option was to run to Wal-Mart (ewwww). The stitching is still a little funky on one boot, but maybe they had a bad template.. who knows. They are comfy and warm which is what I need, so that part is fine. I just wish the cosmetic quality of the stitching was on par with the other Bear Paw boots that I own and love."
"For a product that is obviously tight and needs to be tugged and pulled on, it is not very durable.  I followed the fitting guide to pick the correct size, so that is not the issue. The second time I used them, the inner leg material came ripped at the pelvic area seam.  Not very happy about that."
"I bought this for a Mexican resort vacation.  It's sized a bit larger than I anticipated.  The lace or detail is solid bright white but the fabric itself is ecru so in the sunlight this doesn't quite match.  The stitching is uneven and it's only joined on the side right under the armpits but open on the sides which means it flies up a lot if there's a breeze.  If you are self conscious or have concerns about hiding body parts, this probably won't cut it for you."
These are just OK. Really not great feeling of cushioning. Good thing I bought them on sale because I would have sent them back at full price.
These earrings match a necklace that I bought.  They are OK.
"Tough to get on as not very flexible, but once you have it on it doea work great and ia very supportive."
I thought I was buying a sweatpant but it is more of a warm up pant.  Length is very long.  I am going to keep - try to hem the pant legs.  I would not have purchased if I knew what was going to be delivered.  If you want a 100% cotton warm up pant this is the product.
"They looked good but they did not feel good on, they were constantly falling down. I could not wait to get them off."
"I have several pairs The of Z1 & Z2 sandals.  I like the way the size 6 fit, but can wear a 7 also.  I figured being between the two sizes the 7 would be a good fit....nope.  The length was semi-ok, but the width was way too narrow.  Nice shoes... gonna return & re-order the 7.5s."
"I really liked these pants.  Classic look and styling, and extra pocket for the phone.  I wore a pair out and liked them so much I bought the exact same product as a replacement.  Unfortunately the quality had declined substantially.  Even though I ordered the same size, the new pair were a little larger.  I can live with that, but the new pants have cheaper, thinner, flimsier fabric and even the stitching isn't as good.  They are ok, but I won't buy them again."
Too Small but we still kept them..
"I bought this product for myself and I was happy with the purchase overall. It looks like the picture that advertised it. I don't wear it as much due to it causing back fat to bunch up in the back when the back part is tightened. If you are going to wear it u need a cover up. Overall, its very cute though and worth the price. The zipper is easy to zip up and down."
Great material but the unexpected weird location of the pleat right on the front center and back center really highlighted all the wrong places. The top looks beautiful. Unfortunately had to return the product.
This bag is too small for me. However;it is a nice bag
Great watch.  Very nice features and solar/ atomic/ compass. But negative display is hit or miss in seeing it. Need really good light. And at times right angle.  Other than that. Excellent Quality.
"they alright as jeans go,but i am not a jean person."
"Looks exactly like the pictures, and was very well made, but I returned it. I did not realize just how big and bold the fur hood is, it really stands out, especially on my small frame (5'3""). Overall the coat is just a bit too much, almost ostentatious, and not my personal style. Fit true to size though, able to layer with sweater without having to go up in size, good weight wool, zipper stuck a bit initially."
"It's a pretty necklace with its pear shaped purple stone; however, the stone is smaller in person than it looks online and the gold chain is pretty thin and lightweight and it doesn't feel too sturdy. I can't say I love this necklace, but it's nice and it's pretty versatile, you can wear it with a business suit as well as with a cocktail dress."
I usually wear a medium so this is very big but will do. It did shrink a bit. it's like an oversized t shirt. Can't complain too much as it's very inexpensive.
"I read the other reviews and it is true the toe area is SOOOOOOOOOO narrow that you can only wear them for a few hours, I am really mad that I bought them honestly, but I thought because I have a narrow foot that it would be ok.  All I can say is, I needed a brown shoe, this is the right color brown, but honestly I still need a brown shoe wish I could find one in this same color with a better fit.  I do not recommend you purchasing this shoe, at all."
Look good but don't feel good on my feet!
Good material and workmanship but runs small.
"It was pretty, but it was too big. Had to return it"
The design is nice.  But the size is a bit smaller than expected.  I ordered extra large but it seems like it's just large.  Buttons look nice but are cheap and may fall off soon.
"Not as well made as some of its brethren.  Too narrow and the sole is kind of rough.
The other colors are better."
"these are cute, but they seem to catch everything. So far they have gotten stuck in her mothers hair twice and stuck on a shirt she was taking off."
Wanted to love this dress based on reviews i ordered my normal size small in 3 different colors. Tried the dress on today and it was a tad big normally small is a perfect fit luckily after a few hot washes i was able To shrink it
"Thick fabric, May not work for summer. Runs small in the arms. Great for tall women."
This is a very casual poncho. and doesn't hang as low as pictured. But it will do.
"The top cover doesn't really do its job. The design of the belts is thoughtful, but the belts are way too long to hold the bag body together. The shape of the bag would seem awkward, since the stuff in it would keep leaning outwards. Not very satisfying."
"These slippers look just like the picture, very cute, and they are warm and comfortable.  The problem I have with them is they keep slipping off my feet and tripping me up.  I haven't fallen yet, but I've had to catch myself a couple times.  I wear a size 10 in shoes and ordered the size 9/10. I've worn them for a few months and they are holding up okay, but have lost most the support in them.  So I'm back to searching for another kind."
"Not bad, but most of the time it looks like I am wearing a necklace with rings, the writing disappears behind the other rings pretty easily"
These run extremely narrow.  I've always worn narrow shoes and I wish I'd sent these back.  Am going to try to stretch them.
They're OK. I didn't realize they were painted. I have had them on since they arrived and they're fine. Not the best quality but not bad.
I had to return them as they were too large.  I have found that Crocs made in Mexico in women's size 8 fit me but the Crocs made in China in size 8 are 1/2 inch larger and fall off my feet.  I was very disappointed as I wanted the lined clog to keep my feet warm during the colder days.
"I ordered this for my daughter's upcoming first communion - she chose it and liked the flowers. I read that it seemed small but my daughter is petite so I figured I'd give it a try. The veil is absolutely lovely; the flowers are quality, attached securely, and the veil material is soft. The edging makes the veil cascade nicely too. If they would just make the veil itself about 8"" longer it would be absolutely PERFECT. As it is now, it's not even as long as my daughter's hair, so it just doesn't look right.
It's unfortunate because it would cost pennies to use just a little more material, but they'd get 5 stars from me for it. I may return it or keep it as a dress up item for my girls since it is that pretty."
"These fit perfectly, but they are very cheaply made....duh, look at the price. I'm pretty sure these won't last long, but I will wear them till they break..very cute!"
"The hat is all right, except for the sparkles fall off. This is an issue because I have pets and I don't want them to get stuck in their paws."
Nice! Love it!
"Very pretty, but these earrings are teeny-tiny...VERY, VERY, VERY SMALL!  You can barely see the stone.  I just want to warn you that the picture is deceiving.  Luckily, I bought these for a child."
"Here's the thing...it's a good quality watch, and to most it's probably the perfect size but I find it painfully small. I'm use to larger watches and this is more like a bracelet to be honest. Girly. Got it for my birthday so I am going to keep it. But I think the entire brand is a little overrated. Opinions will vary though."
"Had to return these clogs, even though they fit fine....reason....The heel design was such that it did not provide stability when walking.  It was just too easy to twist ankle to side. I had experienced foot fracture previously and did not want to risk a repeat."
"Love, love this dress. What a great deal, too; it even included a cute necklace. The fabric is soft, it's comfortable to wear, and best of all, flattering to my figure (and forgiving of a few flaws). I usually wear a 12 and got the XL, which fits well. One thing to be aware of is that it runs very LONG. I'm 5'8"" and planned to wear this with some cute flats. I need to get it hemmed about 1"" in order to do that.

Edited to note - this photo was taken AFTER I'd had the dress hemmed. I should have had them take off a bit more. Still do recommend the dress, but unless you're extremely tall or planning on 4"" heels, you'll need to get it hemmed.

Edit #2. After one time wearing the dress and washing as directed, the seam is coming undone in one place along the waistband. I think I can easily fix it, but there may be some quality issues that buyers should be aware of."
Not soft. not as good as Nike!
"Beautiful gown. WAY to small after ordering it in an XL, I am normally a 10/12. The sequence are quite scratchy under the  arms. I tried it on and after 5 minutes I broke out in an itchy rash where the dress scratched me. I could not wear to the 20's party after all. I was very disappointed.
Shipping was outrageous! BUT it did arrive within a day and a half which was impressive. I am hoping to return it if the price is decent."
"This is the first retinol product I ever bought. I thought I could get my skin ready for a possible retin a treatment in a month (which I did get). It's a very creamy serum, has a light scent, not bad but I didn't appreciate that either. Packaging is great, which allows you to dispense as much or little as you need. It didn't do anything to my skin in terms of wrinkle care, but it slightly calmed my skin during a small breakout. It absorbs on the skin pretty fast and goes well with other products. It's also a gentle product, now that I'm using retin a for my face, I use this for the area under the eyes, which has some fine lines and is very dry, my skin tolerates it well even though there's no improvement yet.
But I think the retinol concentration is too low to be worth the money. I ordered this product in January, the price was $39.99. A couple months later, $56.99?? What's the change??"
"The shoes were in perfect condition. The 11 is too short for my size 10.5 medium, low-volume foot with high arch.  And if anyone at Skechers wants to hear my sad story:  My favorite house shoes are a pair of Skechers Go Walk slip-ons. As an older woman with low volume feet (and extremely high arch), I need comfort. I've been trying to find a Skechers replacement for a few years now but the size 11s are too short or too loose or just too ugly. I guess I'll have to pay more for a better shoe. Boo hoo."
This is an attractive shoe but (to me) not nearly as comfortable at Merrell's Barefoot line which I should have stuck to..
Wore for Zumba class for only 15min. and it hurt.  The width is too narrow for my feet other than that it's fit good.
"okay pants.  not modern fit at all, pretty baggy"
"Loved the look, however my wide feet didn't fit very well :("
A little bit shinning material is good for hiking or exercise but not good looking as daily legging.
"These are cute and because they remind me of boots I wore in my teenage years - I bought them.  However, they are narrow for my foot.  They also have no arch support so bought orthotics to go in them.  They also have a sole seam in the middle of your foot.  Not good.  I didn't return these but will only wear for a couple of hours at a time.  Disapointed - because they are cute!"
Right size but side stays poke my arm so I won't wear it. I bought 3 bally bras 2 years ago and live them but they did away with that one. Dang.
"Great build quality, comfortable to wear , good pocket access.
Laptop pocket is very tight , identified volume capacity is deceiving, not argumentatively,but did not meet expectation for overnite hotel stay. This item is more of a high-end book/laptop bag."
ok in general
"These shoes are water shoes. They are great for water only.
If you wear them on concrete surfaces they wear out extremely fast.!!!
Buyer beware"
"pretty color, material is light but as it is full you won't see through it as much,  very nice dress,"
"Nice looking, sturdy watch, but doesn't keep accurate time. Nice conversation piece though."
"Fits as expected for Asian sizing, so make sure you consult the listed measurement chart before ordering. Cute, but it doesn't hang on me like the picture shows: the neckline is positioned higher like a crewneck t-shirt, not as flattering. I like the cool fabric and it's easy to pack for a trip, but it also wrinkles easily and requires a lot of steaming/ironing to look nice again. Shrinkage in laundering mostly affected the length.

NOTE: the very patterned fabric is ""mismatched"" in several seam locations on my dress---sleeves, hem, etc. If you are the type that would be bothered by sloppy sewing, probably best to avoid some of these Boho-style fabrics manufactured overseas."
"These are really pretty but I don't like how they hang off of my ear. It's hard to describe but it just looks awkward, like they're too big for the posts and they hang out of your lobe instead of being flush."
"I was so excited about this dress after reading the reviews. I'm usually around a 12-14 dress size; I got the XXL to fit my bust and, while it does fit in the bust, it's way too big in the waist, and doesn't taper in nearly as dramatically as the picture. A thin belt would be the only style that would really go with this dress, but a thicker belt is going to be the only solution to defining shape and handling the excess fabric, so I'm out of luck. For the price, I may take it to a seamstress, but also the fabric is sort of gross so I may just donate this. (It's a heavy, thick, slightly-textured stretch knit that would be much too heavy for spring or summer - or even a warm fall day. Here in CA, it's pretty much unwearable for about 9 months of the year.) Also, the ""teal"" is a true forest green in person - not as pictured. The quality seems to be good though, which is why I gave it 3 stars. The collar is sewn down which I didn't want, but the buttons are on there solidly and the seams are tight, so it's much better quality than I expected for the price.

A note about the seller: they didn't want to deal with the return process to send it back to China so they offered me a 30% refund and to just keep it. I had to push for a larger refund, but it was still not 100%, plus I'm stuck with just one more thing to get rid of. They did, however, issue the refund quickly."
"It's a pretty dress, but my daughter thinks it is itchy and won't wear it."
nice to have end smaller- both ends have bulky clasps..you only need one lg and one o ring
I like the heaviness of the cloth but it is too tight around the chest and arms.  I've been wearing a large shirt for many years and have not gained much weight.  Even the arms are almost skin tight.  Maybe I got a lemon.  But it is not comfortable at all.  The length is fine because I ordered the tall size.
"My husband and I both ordered The Jefferson shoe by the Native.  It's light and a bit cooler looking that similar shoes on the market.  We wanted to love them so badly but there are fit issues.

Sizing - My husband is a size 12, all shoes in his closet are a 12.  He tried a 12 in this and it was huge!  He returned it and got a size 11, there was still an extra inch of space and his heel was sliding all over.  He gave up and decided to not even go for the 10.  I ordered a Women's size 9 (Men's 7) and it seems to be the appropriate size for me (9.5 is my normal size).

Fit - The toe box is quite narrow for my normal width feet.  The shoes are very comfy but after 15 minutes of walking my toes were cramping from the narrowness.  These are going to now be my around the house shoe.

I am willing to try out other models by Native for a better fit.  I love the design and the price."
"My husband has a 32"" waist and these were snug on him in the hip and groin area. :( Cheaply made too."
"After reading other reviews to size up, and given the fact that I was on short time frame - needed for a wedding, I ordered 2 sizes up figuring I could take it in as needed. It was still too small !! I don't know if it was mismarked, or what, but I could not wear it, and packaging was accidently thrown away. So now I a cannot even return...Love the dress , but save your return slips.."
"I was quite happy with these when I got them. They fit very well (I'm 5,3, 120 lbs), were quite comfortable, and were just the right color (opaque purple). However, about a week later, I found a run in them after I had worn them only twice. By the end of the night, a rather large hole had formed on the right thigh, and I have not been able to wear them since. I'm a little disappointed."
Seems to be an okay shoe for a good price.  Too soon to know about wearability.
These are good for short walking distances only.
Cute but one of the stars fell off after only a couple of times wearing them.
"Didn't realize how good these slim-fits look and feel.  Been an athlete all my life, but never wore anything but Dockers to work,  i.e. loose fitting flat front chinos, and realize now that I had a pair of Haggar's a few years ago, and was really liking their durability and fit.  These Haggar pants fit very nice, not too tight and not too loose.  The ""tobacco"" and ""chocolate"" colors are great.  Washing instructions say to wash inside out, and seem to be ""wrinkle free"" or ""resistant.""

Warning!  Update:
Instructions say to remove pants from washer, and dryer, promptly in order to prevent wrinkling, and I adhered to those instructions for quite a while, until just one wash without ""promptness"" a pair of these pants came out of the dryer with a permanent ""inside out"" crease that does not get ""washed out"" with subsequent washes!  Gotta drop these to ""average"" and won't be buying them again.  Aren't there any more good quality 100% cotton, wrinkle-free, washed in a simple manner, without worrying about all this promptness all the time?!"
"While I do love the short and the color, i do wish it was longer like it appears in the pic. I ordered a size larger than I normally do and it fits okay but it is still kinda small. It has slots up the sides that go a little too far up to suit me. If it were a little bigger I don't think the slits would bother me so much."
"I brought this for my 18month old grandson to wear to a wedding.  He looked adorable and we receives a lot of comments.  I real like the style of the outfit but it is the material were I am totally disappointed for the price. The pants, hat and bow tie are made of cheap polyester material I don't believe it will survive one washing.  The suspenders are made from some cheap material (unlike the real elastic suspenders).  Because it is made so cheaply I believe it overpriced by at least $10."
Cute slipper but too wide and long
Love them but they were too right on my feet.
"This shoe runs pretty narrow. If you have a wide foot even the wide size will feel narrow in the toe box. This is also a pretty stiff shoe, which is what I was looking for. It will definitely require 20 or more miles to break in. I think I will need to get some quality insoles soon and try them. Very good ankle support.  Worst part of shoe is the lacing system is sketchy at best. Top lace hooks seem fragile and are a bit too shallow to hold lace with confidence while lacing up the shoe."
"First of all they were made in Mexico. They stunk so badly we had to wash them right away. They are very coarse and abrasive, not something to wear in warm weather at all."
Doesnt fit as well as I had hoped.
When I washed them they turned splotchy yellow and I haven't worn them since.
And slanted forward...I'm trying to break them in by standing on them. Will have to see...
waist band should be somewhat tighter.
The boot fits fine in length but the width is a little snug. It is really tight at the bottom lace holes and needs a good few days to break in.
No longer wowed by it... Just another ordinary skirt
Good house shoe for the price
"good for that price, but they're cheaply made and don't hold for too long."
"Very pleased with product. Great quality,just what I needed. I will look for more Buxton products."
"not fitting as some of their other shirts of same size, tight, will need to return.  pretty design and fabric, nice feel to fabric."
"Somewhat too large. If I get a smaller size, my heel won't fit. I didn't like it."
"These are pretty but Im not so sure about the sizing of the spirals. I got lazy and left my plugs out so I had to re-stretch. When I got to the correct size I went to put in a pair of my hangers and they didn't come close to fitting. I had to got up a size in the spirals.
I did like that the spirals were separated and labeled in their own bags."
Cute just was too small I like the different ways to style this
Cute but shorter than I expected
"I think these boots are super cute.  However, when I put them on the height of them is so tall that they rub my knee caps while I am walking which I have found to be quite annoying.  And I am an average size person 5' 4"".  Another thing is that either the zipper that runs the length of the boot is not supposed to unzip, or neither zipper on both boot doesn't work.  Which is another big flaw for me because when I wear boot socks, not being able to unzip the zipper causes my socks to scrunch up when I put them on.  I love the color of the boots and they are very cute but I am debating on weather to return or not."
They were way to big and the texture of the material was not what we were thinking. The color was great though. We had to return the shorts.
"These shoes are just okay and feel fine.  However, I'm disappointed that these say Walking Cradles, but are the Elite line, which must be Walking Cradles cut rate brand.  The shoes are clearly not up to the standard of most walking cradle shoes.  I think it is deceptive that potential buyers are not alerted to the  fact that they are buying this Elite line.  Frankly, I am surprised at Amazon for not being more forthcoming with this; and as a PRIME customer for many years, Amazon has not disappointed me before."
"shoe is cute and love that it is so soft and pliable for baby's feet while crawling and learning to stand.  too bad that it is tricky to get them on and they don't even really feel like they are fully on because there is no way to really get baby's foot into them well because the material is so pliable.  it's like trying to get a noodle through a hole.

too bad, super cute and IF only they would have thought of how a real mom puts on shoes to a real baby."
"A little smaller than I expected.  I was hoping to wear it like a cross-body purse but the strap isn't quite long enough.  It does hold my passport, cash and a couple of credit cards.  I have an e ticket so I just folded that to fit in here.  I ended up keeping it in my carry on bag at the top so I can easily access my passport, ticket and money.  Convenient and lighter than a purse."
"It fits per the size but was too short. I'm 5'7"" and I definitely would have needed a ""tall"", unless you're ok with not having to bend over in the slightest."
It does not stays on.
"These are okay for the price, but give the worst atomic wedgies on earth. For smaller butts, these would be great. For those of us with larger hind quarters....probably not the best choice!"
Very long and it has weird buttons on the side. Buyers remorse for sure.
The quality is good but their fit just too large for my 2.5 year old. I would have to use this one almost after one year..
"The material is a bit rough and heavy to serve as a tropical pajama. I have others with the same label
, but they are not the same."
"I purchased this sweater about 2 sizes larges than my normal size and the sleeves are a bit short.  While they are cuffed, you cannot unfold the cuff since it is sewn up!  The sweater is also a little thinner than I had hoped but not as thin as the others I have purchased online.  I like my sweaters thick and roomy.  Even though it fits my torso with a bit of room, the sleeve length is a bit disappointing."
Love the fit..Color a bit off but not too bad
They keep the feet warm on my lady friends. They liked the colors and such. I bought the 3 pack because of my 3 closest friends like socks? IDK.  it was worth it though.
"Needed a white, padded racerback tank/cami & this fill the bill better than anything else I could locate, but I sewed the length shorter because it was way too long in my opinion.  I don't want to show butt crack with low-rider jeans, but this length is overkill to me.  The label on it mentions not putting anything abrasive against it, & I can already see that it's not going to wear well, but maybe my electric fabric shaver will remove any pilling that occurs."
Mismatched color
not my hubs cup of tea.
I liked the overall design but would have been little more compact.
pero
My husband has owned two or three pairs of these in the past and this pair he just isn't please with as they don't seem to be stretching out. They hurt his feet due to being too narrow so he is only able to wear them for a few hours. This is the first time we've had issues with skecher shoes
"These are nice, the sheen is not too bad looking, the fit is a bit loose though.  The material seems of good quality, and they are comfortable enough.  Probably or a size down would have been in order.  I like my leggings to be skin tight, these have a bit of looseness to them.  Addendum:  Wore them for the first time to go out.  As I was finishing up getting ready I noticed them sliding down, and realized the issue may have been my underwear (which normal I go without, but these leggings were a medium opposed to my usual small).  After tugging every few minutes I decided to ditch the undies.  This seemed to fix the issue.  They breath nicely, but over time lose their shape (Mine were medium and with leggings I wear small so this may have been an issue).  Upon looking at the close up pic in the product pictures here the material is NOT what is advertised.  These are more a heat treated lycra which is what gives the sheen.  It is an nice material, but I wanted the smooth wet look type of material.  These need to come in small, and the pics need to be a bit more of what the product actually is.  I am going to size them in with a seam on the inseam to see if this helps with the fit, but right now they sag at the knees, both front and back...not good."
I removed some of the extra hardware ( not sure why it was there beyond cosmetic reasons) and trimmed the length to fit
The quality of these boots is very good. The only problem is that they are not wide enough. I ordered the 2E and it is still to narrow for my foot.
Cute dress but see-through and obviously made of cheap material.
Nice color. I'm petite and it fits good. But quality could be a bit better.
Kind of sticks up on the top of the head with extra material.
"were too tight, had to give to my son"
"It fits my wife well, but she wasn't entirely happy with the actual appearance.  She knows how to style hair though and thinks she can cut it to appear like it does in the picture.  Overall for the price it wasn't a bad buy, but they should update their photo to depict the true appearance of this wig."
Kind of cheap. The 'fleece' wore out pretty quickly
"Really hard to put on, too many hooks which are starting to come loose.  I didn't get the smaller defining waist line I expected as well."
"Unfortunately, this bra was too small for me.  I am a C cup and ordered the XL, but it's just too small.  The top of the bra cuts into me causing a slight bulge and then I bulge through the bottom of the bra as well, between the flap and the part that goes around the bust.  Overall, it just doesn't work for me.  I think this is for someone who is more of a true B cup.  I can't really comment on the effectiveness of the bra for nursing since it's too small, but when I tried it on I did try to unbutton the snap closure with one hand and struggled to do that.  It could be because it was too tight, but I'm not sure.

*I originally received this item at a discount to provide an honest review."
needs more padding around the neck
It was too big so I had to return it. It was a very stiff material that may have softened with a wash but even if it did fit I probably wouldnt have liked it.
fast delivery but very rough cotton texture and must b ironed after everyone was and dry.
This was way too small but it could have been a great product.
Should have been waterproof. :) But it works and my daughter likes it.
"I really wanted to have some microfiber underwear and the quality of these seems to be awesome. They are simply not the size I expected and I bought them twice thinking I was going to get something different the second time. I am going to see if these are available in X-large and try 1 more time. In the meantime, my girlfriend enjoys wearing these to bed sometime and says they are really comfy. My loss, her gain."
"I got a size up based on other reviews, but it's tight in the shoulders. If I raise my arms up, the whole shirt pops up. However, it fits great everywhere else so going up another size would make it really baggy. I love it otherwise."
They do run big I didn't read  reviews befor i bought them so i would say order a size and a half down
"Beautiful sweater; no complaints with either quality or appearance. One note - this is not white, but a very light cream. I had a white seersucker outfit that I ordered this sweater for and returned the sweater because it didn't match."
"These Beverly Hills Polo Club Men's 5 Pack Low Rise Brief, Black/Charcoal/Grey Heather/Red/Blue, in size Medium are a Nice variety of colors and a great Value pack for the price. These do however run about two sizes too small and are made with thin material. The material is thin enough that it shows very prominent ""outlines"" of the frontal area when worn, as well as having the behind clearly visible through the underwear."
"Like I said, it should come up higher on the calf. Too easy to slip down when working or walking."
Super Cute but too tight to wear with pants. They'd be too big in the toe if I went a size up. Sad I couldn't keep these.
"They are very comfortable, looked like the picture.  Look like a inexpensive boot but I would recommend them to my friends."
"ok, nice. but shrunk after first wash."
This is my 3rd Cole Haan Belt and the leather quality feels lower than the previous 2. the buckle is nice but the black leather is not soft like the picture and dryer and cheaper looking.
"when I found these boots on Amazon I was so excited! The page clearly stated the opening at the top of the boot was an approximately 16 inches in circumference and since I have larger calves, I figured I would give them a shot. I ordered them and waited anxiously since other reviewers have said the Fawn color isn't very nice in person. I loved the color but much to my dismay, the openings of the boot are only 13.5 inches! There's no way I'm going to fit those over my calves!! And unfortunately, due to a mix up around the house, the original box was discarded so I can no longer send them back to Amazon :(

However, I purchased a boot stretcher and some Melatonian spray (also from Amazon) and through repeated usage, have been able to stretch them enough that they can now go over leggings! So, if like me, you love the color of these boots but have larger calves, don't give up hope! I guess a cobbler would work too..."
They're fine. Just what I expected.
Got it for husky 9 year old. Got a medium---was way small!!!
"I ordered my usual size and should have ordered at least one cup size bigger. The cups seem really shallow, which caused a bubble boob effect. It also didn't provide a lot of top support, as I bounced quite a bit just in walking to test it out. This was likely due to the cup being too small. It had great band support, and if it had a deeper cup, I don't think I'd be returning it. Perhaps I'll reorder it larger. With free returns, it is worth it I think. I actually loved that the cups stayed in the front of my ribcage. Being a 28 band and an F or FF cup, I typically have a hard time not looking like a ""fisheye"" or having the underwire drive into my armpit. This one didn't do either of those things."
The silver/grey was a shiney look to it therefore my husband will not wear them.
Shrunk after one single wash
"I ordered these in a half size up (I'm usually a 7.5 and I ordered an 8) based on the reviews on Amazon and it was a good thing I did.  These do run a half size small so order up.  After putting these shoes on and walking around the living room, I really wanted to like them.  They are very comfortable both in the soles and also the soft elastic band running all around the top of shoe that keeps your foot securely in place.  Seems like a shoe you could actually walk all day in.  However, even in the silver metallic color, they are frumpy.  Something about the shape screams orthopedic shoe and made my average sized feet look very wide and potato-like.  If you're looking for comfort, then go for it.  But you'll be sacrificing all style."
"I was absolutely in love with these when I first got them. They are the exact size and color I wanted. The detail is great and I was optimistic about the quality I was getting. I wore them for about 3 days without incident. When I woke up the fourth morning my ears hurt and itched like crazy. They were red and swollen. I had to take them out immediately and put in a pair of my old nylon studs. I guess I'm not going to be wearing these every day like I had originally hoped. I'm disappointed in the quality of the ""sterling silver"". If you have sensitive ears like me, I advise steering clean of these earrings."
"Nice jeans but were too short for a 32 inseam. I would return but it might take another 2 weeks to get a pair so I will try to find some locally. Shipper communicated that the date on Amazon was not accurate and they would be slower. That was appreciated but had I known that ahead of time, I might have used a different store."
"I guess I can't complain too much since it was under $20, but it is definitely cheaply made. The trim is not finished off and the logo feels stiff an crinkly. It does look hot with a cardigan though."
Fit like a men's 5.5. Much larger then a youth 5.5
Order a size up! I got my size which was a B a full B. I never thought I would say this but too much clevage. Other then that yes this worked well not sure how it would do with bigger sizes.
"These are some decent shoes, not the classic puma shoe, by material, but I match the shirt I have. I matched pretty good."
"I really like the look of this sandal, but it is a little tight across the foot (especially the band at the front of the shoe).  More importantly, it has almost zero traction on the bottom.  I almost slipped a number of times at the office when I wore them.  I decided they were too attractive to return, though, so I took them to my favorite shoe-repair guys to have them put rubberized pads on the bottom of the sandals, adding to the expense of this purchase."
"I bought these because I heard that they provide good arch support. To be fair, I have really high arches. Its just bad evolution, is what it is. Anyway, these provide minimal arch support. Maybe for a normal arched person they'd be fine, but they don't provide the pain free strut I'm looking for."
"Cute shirt but there should be a ""fits weird"" option when reviewing The body is large, but the sleeves are kind of small and a bit snug. I still wear it but wish I was styled differently."
This belt wasn't what I was looking for.  It's essentially just a long piece of stretchy Velcro loop band that is held closed. With a short piece of the Velcro hook material. Kind of cheap looking
"I bought half a size bigger as I want to wear it with socks. With socks, the toes feel slightly snug while the heel is ok. Without socks, the toe is good but the heel slides off easily. I hope that the leather will stretch a little at the front after a few wears."
Real cute and real cheap!
Is ok for costume
"What are these made of?  The material feels weird - they should be cotton, at least that is what I ordered.  But, I think they are not - they must be polyester - my feet sweat awful in these and they are slippery!"
"I bought this for my daughter and she loved it, but is heavy and she is 9 but very small for her age."
"Shoe is great, after two months of use five days a week. The stitching on the shoe by the lace is starting to rip. I'm trying to contact the maker cus I'm out of the Amazon 30 day return.  I love the shoe, I'm hope they could just replace it."
The shoe itself fits as expected but the straps are not tight enough so my foot ends up slipping out of them. Good for a cheap pair of sandals
"I thought these shoes would help with my achy feet.  I purchased these shoes for my second job that requires me standing and walking for long periods of time.  I always see nurses wear them  so I thought they would work for me. They didn't!  However, they are comfortable for housework or running short errands.  They are cute for Crocs."
"I like the colors and style, but the top was not as long as I was hoping (I bought this to cover my baby bump) and it did not fit my breasts (too small, but I expected that). The shorts were too tight to be any use. There were some small threads hanging from the bottom hems.

Overall: it's pretty, but not good for maternity (unlike some reviewers suggest) and be aware it runs small!"
To be brief.....they are fine
Plastic piece between toes is hard and uncomfortable.
"Although the picture implies a well-cushioned sole on which to walk, it is very stiff and hard."
"These shrunk quite a bit in the sleeves, making them angle in a weird way. They are now just worn around the house."
Cute however the chain broke in one day after wearing. I guess you get what you pay for. Spend a little more for better quality
Other reviews indicated these  run small so I was aware before ordering and this is OK for me as I am more like 42/43 than 44 anyway. Was also aware of material being polyester but not owning anything in this material at 100 % I wasn't aware how cheap these would appear. Bought to wear with blue blazer but will end up wearing to knock around instead. Did however like the styling so decided not to return.
Comfortable and cute but more suited for lounging at home.
"I liked the  sandals, but it's a shame they didn't have half sizes. I'm an 8 1/2, but got a 9 instead. It's slightly big. Others have noticed it too when they see me with them on. However these shoes are comfortable."
Clothes are sometimes hard to fit.
"Was expecting ""hosery"" thickness but it is a bit thicker making my shoes fit a little tight.  However, they do stay on my foot and the non-slip bottom is a nice touch.  These are a bit expensive in my opinion."
"Too big and heavy for me really, but very classy looking!  Holds lots."
It fits as expected but the underwire is very uncomfortable and it feels as though it's about to poke out.  I need the underwire but this is the first bra I've had such issues...
"doesn't hold much, size wise.  A textbook is a tight fit in the biggest compartment.  Easy to sling over your shoulder, though.  Seems to be well made enough.  Just don't like the sling bag style."
"I saw the Louboutin version of these and thought they were super cute, so when I found similar style heels for cheaper I had to have them! I have worn them out once, my complaint is that the toe strap should either be wider or be positioned a bit lower on the toes.. it shows a lot of toe. Also they could use a bit more cushion on the ball of your foot pad. I am planning to get some of the gel inserts for them. Over all I am happy with my purchase. They are definitely hot shoes for spring/summer."
"Straps are too short ; otherwise fit is good
I'll be returning this"
"These looked fun in the picture, but the pants run large, and the stripes are much wider than they look in the photo.  Be sure that is whst you want, and order a bit smaller than the size chart indicates"
"They fit well, but I have VERY high arches.  These shoes don't work for me when doing side to side Jazzercise.  There is not enough outer support for my arches."
"The watch is too large.  Also, the website description said 40mm diameter but also said 45mm diameter, so I misunderstood how large this watch was when I bought it.  It would've been preferable if the size was more clear on the description."
"Cute, comfortable dress but it was too small so I had to return it.

I'm 5'5"", 140 lbs, and 32DD bust. My usual size medium was too small."
"Cute as can be, but the padding on the inside makes them a size or two too small! I ordered a different style with less inside padding hoping they are not as bulky."
"A bit small runs about half size too small.  Very cute,  but killed my feet after two hours."
shrinks a lot!
"These arrived quickly, but the cord started to fray after just a few wears. Not terribly happy with the quailty."
"When I opened the box the earrings were no longer attached to the box. The hooks are already loose. They are very cute, but I'm afraid to tighten the little fork for fear of breaking it off. These may go back."
"I am 5' 10"" and take 38x30"" jeans.  The legs on these ""large"" rain pants
were about 4"" too long and taking them in would interfere with the zippers,
so they have to go back.  Otherwise, this seems like a durable, well-made
product.  There are no pockets in the rain pants, but zippers on both sides
provide access to pants pockets."
Shoes fit tighter than I expected. I'll see if I can stretch them out. Maybe after a few wears they'll be OK.
"I wear a men's athletic shoe for the greater width. The stitching across the toe of the Eruptor keeps it from stretching, so it is not quite as comfortable for me as an open style, like the  Exchange. Also, it could use a pull tab at the heel. If those things don't bother you, you will find it to be a lightweight and comfy shoe."
The picture does it justice..not as big as they say..
"I usually wear an 8, but my podiatrist wanted me to get some 8.5's because my toes were running into the end of the shoe in a size 8.  I ordered this shoe in an 8.5 narrow, however, they are much too short and my toes still push against the shoe too much.  Also too wide for a size narrow.  I like the look of them, so too bad."
"This dress is exactly as seen in the photo, true to length and style, but the material is quite sheer.  and given the material, proper undergarment may be an issue as it will show.  It's a very pretty dress, just wished it was thicker"
"These are unbelievably comfortable!! Opt for the leather or the synthetic material gets really stinky really fast, making these a sort of disposable shoe. I have the leather in this green colour, they look DISGUSTING after a few months of light hiking and easy wear. Some water dripped on them and they have a very dark spot on them now, I'm considering having them dyed. All in all they're an extremely comfortable shoe, easy to slip on and off, I put them on out of the box and wore them for days without as much as a single blister. For that they get the three stars, but the leather needs to be of better quality, and the 'vegan' leather (I hate that term) option needs to be really assessed as they're just horrendous.

True to size and easy to wear. Dress these up or down! I will buy again in another colour."
"The charms I received are OK.  I won't say great.  They look much, much smaller in person than they do on the website.  I understand that is probably necessary to depict detail, but I think there should be some sort of statement that they are smaller in person than they appear on your computer screen.  Also two of the beads did not fit the bracelet (that I ordered from this vendor).  They were too small, so they were a waste, unfortunately.  Overall the charms are cute, and I think my daughter will like them, but I was personally a bit disappointed and guess I expected more because I saw them enhanced on the webpage."
"Quality is not quite what I expected, but it's okay for the price. Maybe I should have realized it when ordering, but it does not come with the black sweater. The skirt is not woven, but is printed on a shiny white fabric (the underside is white). It serves it's purpose though, my boyfriend has no complaints. I do wish I'd gone with a slightly higher quality product though."
"Ok, very nice quality but was too hot for the purpose I needed it so I returned it."
"super sexy. but i got them to small. i normal wear anywhere from a 9 to a 10 so i got 9.5 and they were still super tight! i returned them in hopes to get them in a bigger size but then i found another red shoe from my fave shoe company ""qupid"" and it was less then half the price of these beautiful shoes! so besides the price and me getting them to small i think these would be great shoes!"
"I love Skechers shoes for walking and hiking. I bought these to replace my old pair of Skechers Go shoes. While they're very comfortable, I miss the wider toe spread area of the older Skechers. After my usual walk, my feet felt squished, and my bunion ached terribly even with my support on. The wide toe area is what made Skechers my go-to shoes but I'm going to have to search a little more for a new favorite walking shoe."
Okay for price. Already coming apart at the front of the boot.
This was cute however it was very tight. I wasn't able to move very easy in it or take it off easily. My husband loved it. He said it was incredibly sexy.
"It was very thigh it the arms, so thigh that I didn't even ware it."
"Read it was small, although the pictures in this Ad can't be the medium.  This thing is really small, i mean female small.  I'm only 5'9"" 150 lbs with rather small wrists, and this still looks small on me.  like i'm wearing a kids watch.  That being said, it's nice to find a rugged watch that isn't a 1 lb chunk of steel.  I usually wear my rugged watches when i'm being active...they always get hung up on stuff.

still well made, but it really really is small.  probably smaller than you think."
"These are really loose in the groin, almost like regular boxers. I prefer briefs that hug much tighter."
My husband liked this. I had a hard time figuring out how to put it on and the thigh highs that are built in are very large fishnet so my toes were all popping out. If it's cheap then I recommend.....but I would not pay more than $6 for this.
"1-19-14. I did not count the gaskets but did separate them into stacks that appeared similar in size. They are Very thin and curl easily so it difficult to actually determine the diameter but appear to range from 10mm to 27mm.  Some are 0.009 thousands (0.00022860m) thick but most 0.22 thousands (0.00055880m) thick as measured with a micrometer. I haven't used them and cannot evaluate their suitably at this time.

1-21-14. Without my requesting it, the vendor refunded the purchase price as I did not find the product to be of the quality I had hoped.  I have used the vendor for other products that were very good, but this one just did not measure up to the expected value.  The 3-stars is a valid evaluation of this particular product, not the vendor's performance that would be rated 5-stars."
No tummy control and my boobs are falling out
The tank is smaller than expected and the fabric is pretty see-through. I would give it  2 1/2 stars but I can't so I'm rounding up to 3. Not a terrible product but I would not order again.
I have wide feet and these fit but after a few minutes start to hurt my feet. I guess it's my fault for ordering regular width sneakers. Otherwise they're comfortable and look cute.
Not sewn properly but ok
Little thin but works for now.
over time it broke but still a really nice big bag
"Leg length will have to be altered. Has to be 37"". Waist is exact; little give."
"Shoes fit right. Jut needs a little more cushion inside.  Perfect when I need to pressure wash a vehicle, water doesn't get inside my feet."
wide enough but the tight from the top to bottom so rubs my tow nails.  Can wear in the office but not out in the real world.
"The only ""magnetic"" clasps I have purchased over the years have had a sleeve that slips over the magnetic connection and screws on to the other side...very effective and gives total security. It seems all the new clasps have only the magnets...I don't trust them...all it would take for someone to take your necklace is to simply reach up and snatch it! Also if you catch something on the necklace (i.e., comb, another necklace, ring, etc.) it just pops right off your neck with barely any resistance at all.
I much prefer the old Magic Clasps, which do not exist any more...I have yet to find something as good as they were.
These are OK but I would not use them on any valuable jewelry...or on any costume/fashion jewelry that might be too heavy for the mag-connection to hold at all."
"Good, but they don't tell you that the pins are smaller than our 12 mm watch.  So you have to remove the pins (PAIN IN THE @#$#) and use the old pins or you have to return it."
wrinkles super easy
This is just an OK ring for me nothing really stands out about it. It is stamped and looks like the picture but the shine was not there. Nice ring though
"My husband has worn Levi's 505 regular fit jeans for longer than I can recall, they are his work jeans, he works construction.  I always buy the dark ones thinking that they have been messed with the least so they will hopefully last longer than the ones that have been destructed/prewashed, etc, I have no idea wth happened to Levis recently , but these are not the levi's of the past!  The fabric doesn't even feel like denim, my husband says they feel like ""pajama bottoms"" and are thin, definitely thinner than Levi's of the past.  I looked at the labels (I ordered 5 pairs) and they were all made in Haiti, not sure if that matters or not, but they most definitely aren't what we expected.  We will keep them, but I don't hold out a lot of hope that these will last for long.  I will update this review once he has worn them awhile to comment further on how long these hold up."
This skirt was cute but way too small. I might purchase it in the future in a bigger size. I suggest going up 2 sizes from your normal size.
"Needed iron after laundry, and style does not becoming large size wearers."
"They run somewhat larger than you'd expect. I mean, I expect them to be loose since they are sleep wears, but these turned out to be larger than that."
Served me well for about 6 months. I work in ski boots and spend most of the rest of my time in flip flops. They didn't handle constant use any better than a pair of dollar store flip flops. Although they did seem slightly more resistant to melting next to the campfire.
"They are pretty, but I question that they are actually sterling silver. For the weight, and size, I am questioning the true quality. They were much bigger then I expected, I prefer smaller. But for the price, sterling, really???"
This was a gift. I did not hear it didn't fit.
"I should of got a size smaller
There some what ok."
These are great socks but would not stay up in our shoes. So I returned them and it worked out great. Ordered a different pair
Kinda cheap but worked for what I needed it for and will be able to use it many more times.
"I did what everyone said and ordered two sizes larger and it was way too large!!! I am returning the larger one and getting one that's one size bigger and hopefully that'll fit better. The arms and chest were okay, but the bottom just flailed out like a flag and made me look like a pregnant oompa loompa. That size was the 2X, I will be ordering a 1x. I usually wear a Large, or Extra large depending on brands and material."
Pants are ok but don't fit - they are way too small!
Nice thick material. Feels like quality. But the zipper is on the wrong side for it to be men's! 3 stars because of the zipper.
"This purse has some good features and some not-so-good features.  First the good features:

--the color is consistent (no variation in color between the different pieces of leather)
--the size is good if you like large purses
--the handles are comfortable
--the stitching looks sturdy
--the detachable shoulder strap is easy to adjust
--the shoulder strap is lined with fabric (maybe to prevent dye bleed-through from the leather?)
--the clips at each end of the shoulder strap rotate 360 degrees so twisted straps won't be a problem

Now for the not-so-good features:

--there is a flaw in the leather that's easy to see because it's at the top, near the handle (see picture)
--the plastic used to protect the handles was sewn into one of the handles (see picture)
--there are no separate pockets or compartments in the purse or in the detachable pouch
--one of the four snaps that holds the inner pouch in place doesn't hold very well
--the shoulder strap has a large buckle that is likely to get caught in shoulder-length or longer hair (ouch)
--the leather on the inside of the purse is not finished

I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.  This might be a great purse for some women but there are enough problems with it that I'm glad I didn't pay the purchase price."
The monkey is creepy. A few of the faces foam parts were glued on crooked.
"They are smaller than I expected and they are not very colorful at all. For the money, it was an okay purchase. It would have been nice if they were similar colors as in the picture"
I wish I would have gone to the craft store and just bought some lace there. This was too short to make a big bow on top of my head. I ended up cutting up some old fishnet stockings to make a headband and tied this lace onto that to make a bow.
"Very cute and great material but the arms are made for a stick figure. I will have to put my daughter in this with a belt as a dress. I'm 5'11 170 lbs so I'm not big, I'm actually pretty stringy and my arms not fitting is a bad sign."
This dress is light weight but modest. The solid color can be accessorized to accent the season. Sorry to say I had to return it. It was a bit small on me.
The Mammoth Evo Clog does not come in wide sizes.
I bought a large but they run small so I should have gotten a xl.  I wear a 36dd I love this brand but was disappointed that it was just a little too tight
But I rocked it at the costume party and received many compliments. It was a fun costume. I would recommend getting the next larger size if you don't like a tight fit.
"Thin, cheap-ish fabric -- good for one season then to the thrift store."
"material was very thin, seemed almost like they were disposable, but they were pretty"
Somewhat smaller than other rings the same size. Does not fit that well
I had to return it because it was too small and too short. I'm 5'9 and it fell short of my knees.
"just ok i guess, not my fav jeans though."
"I didn't really like it. The mesh at the bottom is really thick and looks cheap. It's a bit heavy and it fits small, you definitely need two people to put this dress on. The top part of the dress and under the armpits is itchy. I returned it because it was uncomfortable and it fit way too small. I got a size 7 I think, I usually wear size 7, the length wasn't too bad, I'm 5'4 and it did fit long, but I'm sure it would've been fine with heels. The mesh at the bottom was wrinkled, I wasn't sure how you could iron it. I figured if I tried I'd probably burn it off. I was issued a full refund with no problem, that is why I'm rating a 3."
"The color is gorgeous!!! However, I bought a small and it was way too big. I figured that the wrap style would fit either way, but it looked like a bag when i put it on. The chest area and sleeves were so huge, there's no way I could wear it. I love the dress it just didn't fit and according to the description, and it should have. I wish they offered an extra small and it would probably work."
"Too small, looked much bigger in the demonstration. If you are looking for a good sized wrislet, this is not the one. Make sure you read the dimensions."
"The sneakers looks good, but fits too small. I hace doubts if they are confortable even un bigger size."
"The hat was just as I expected, nice color and fit as expected.  The only problem with it was part of the brim had become unstitched (or wasn't properly stitched in the first place) leaving an opening about 2 inches long.  Because of this I returned it."
Nice wig. OK quality for price. My husband used it for Halloween & it made the costume. I'd recommend it to a friend.
its not bad for the amount quoted. Pretty stylish.
too big for the size and the pants are really long. the fabric is OK. i returned them
"This product was just okay for me. I ordered purple, and was sent wine red, so that was disappointing. It is a little large, but not so large that I can't wear it, especially if I add a scarf or cardigan. Overall, not terrible, but probably will look elsewhere next time."
They do not work very well with peep toe boots . The sock is to low to give support on the ankle area I thought it wouldn't matter but it does and the toe section is tight and gets tighter as you walk because of the heels in the boots . I wouldn't recommend them for boots .
"They are non-descript. I needed gloves to match a white hat, so I'll keep them. I think they are going to be difficult to keep clean."
"I find that it runs very large, but know next size down would be too small."
"I loved the boots, I have worn Laredo boots for years and they hold up well and fit great. But, I purchased these boots mostly for the color, lighter color than I have, but they came darker than pictured. I did not return as I still loved the fit and style of the boot. I will still wear Laredo and I will just keep looking for another pair I like a different color."
"I've purchased from Alpine Swiss before, however I'm finding this particular pair a bit disappointing. First of all, the length of the shoe is fine but I notice a bit of buckling on the sides. The material they're made from is a bit flimsy hence the buckling. I loved my last pair but they were left on an ambulance - I had bigger fish to fry!"
Really wish these boots would have worked out as they are beautiful in person. Its hard to find a wide black square toe in black however my husband wasn't even able to get his ankle into the boots as the opening into the shoe itself was extremely small. Cant beat the price!
Returned it because the color looked different once I saw it in person.
Love the print but it is so big on me . 110 lb and small fits like large
"Very thin socks with a synthetic feeling, although they are supposedly 80% cotton. I wear 7.5 size shoes, bought size 9-11 after reading the reviews, and they fit me well. The socks are a bit different than shown: there is a contrasting stripe on the socks, and additional colors including pink. Overall, the socks are comfortable and suitable for very casual wear, although I will never wear the pink ones. They probably won't last more than a few wears. Lots of socks for the price, so I guess I cannot complain. Next time I will spend more money."
"Five tees for ~$10? At that price point, even if you're having slaves make the shirts, something's gotta give, and the collars are it. Collars lost all shape after the first wash, making the shirts look about a year older than they actually are. Just low quality overall. I didn't have any white undershirts and I needed them quickly, but I'm going to end up replacing them immediately."
Nice jeans but way too big for my son.
"I'm very disappointed in the quality of the item. In my opinion the leather is much too stiff. It has no ability to flex or alter. And while saffiano leather is generally stiffer than other leathers, this is too TOO stiff. Like another reviewer,  I noted that the handles got damaged fairly easily and I do not foresee it lasting long either. Which is sad, the design is actually quite beautiful, and the bag is too pricy for it not to be a quality item.

On the up side.  I love the zebra like internal pattern and it had a zipper and two pockets. There is one zippered pocket on the outside which is literally impossible to get into, and if you do try to squeeze your phone in there it is so restrictive that it scratches the phone or your hand.

Overall, I would not purchase this item again."
"Cute design, but tarnished very quickly and the little rhinestones were falling out within a week. :( I hardly wore it, too."
Could. It fit my narrow feet even with Velcro.
Por what i expect
Nice shoe just doesn't fit
"Although these shoes are absolutely darling, they run a bit big on me.  I normally wear a women's size 6 which is what I ordered.  Unfortunately, I must return them as they just are not a good fit and I feel like I could literally walk out of them easily.  Also, immediately after opening the box, which was packaged VERY well, a super strong chemical odor was apparent.  Had I been able to keep them, I would have aired them out for some time in hopes the odor would go away.  Again, DARLING shoes, very well made and designed, but run a bit big and wide."
I like the fit of this top but the color was not what I expected. I thought it was more tan and it is definitely orange. Orange is not my favorite color. I wish the colors portrayed were more accurate.
Nice design.  The quality could be better.
"My husband and I both bought a set of these for our backpacks on a two week European vacation.  I'm not sure if they really made a difference.  I felt like they kept me organized because I kept different types of garments in corresponding cubes.  However, my husband felt like they actually took up more space in his backpack than if he hadn't used them at all.

I used them again on a trip to California in a suitcase and felt like I could have done without them.  The do help organize, but I don't think they give you any additional space at all.  There is no compression involved, so they are really just good for organizing your garments."
Not bad for the price I just have troble keeping it closed in my pocket. I tote my wallet in my front pocketif you have more then 5 cards to put in this wallet it will not stay close. I have 4 cred cards and driver license and it keep opening in my pocket
The style is super but they are way to large all around. I returned them.
"bra could not fit my 11yr old daughter, she wears 34A and this is tight on the shoulders even when slacken and around the bust, will buy again because the material is very soft and comfortable, but i will try a 36A next time"
It says 2x but was barely an xl
"I debated keeping this although I did not quite fill out the rock-hard cups.  Cute vintage underwear style.  Bottoms just squeezed too much at the top and didn't do anything for me in the back...  Wasn't bad, especially for the price, but nothing special."
These pants fit great! I have nave had that happen before so this was very exciting!  What's that smell? Not real sure but I had to wash them right away. It took most of the smell out but I am hoping once I wear them and put on my body lotion it will make the rest of the smell go away. This is the only reason I gave thsee Capri a 3 instead of 4
Too large and elongated. Stiff and uncomfortable.
Color is not as shown! More of a dull grey color.  Fits well and the size is nice.  Just not as pictured
"It's a nice jacket even tho' too small for me.  Well made, too.  Will give it to my friend's granddaughter. Like it!"
It's pretty for the price
White color is See through
Good quality but I would buy one size smaller.
"These shoes are HUGE!  I almost always take a size 8 or 8 1/2 but this is the biggest size 8 I have ever seen in my life.  I began to wonder if it was a men's size 8 because honestly, these would've probably fit my husband's feet.  They seem like (if they weren't humongous) they would be comfortable and they were very wide (I did ask for the wide width) but I would need about two sizes smaller for these to actually fit. Quality looked good, but I had to return these ginormous boats."
"Item arrived as advertised, but It runs small and thus, didn't fit my daughter. We returned it with no problem."
Nice dress. I'm 27 and 5'3. It goes past my knees a bit.  Fits great. Love the slight holding panel in mid section. It makes me look older though...not sure if I like that. Pretty color.
"Pockets are badly stitched with loose threads, can't fit a cell phone in the side pocket. Legs are real baggy."
"I'm not sure of the fitting. I could say the dress is probably not the best for my body type because I brought this based on other customer reviews. I got the green dress in size L and it looked more like a bathrobe on me (again I could have mistaken my size). To potential buyers, I would say make sure you know your size before you click buy."
"Way too large for me, so I gave them to my son"
Not as satisfied as I have been in the past with Columbia sweatshirts.  Feel that the fiber in the sweathshirt is less quality than they use to be.  Disappointed will keep for use in late spring and early fall.
If you need a cute pump this is it. If you have foot problems you might not be able to wear these for more than a couple hours. I don't make a day of it in these.
"Super cute boots! I don't have ""wide calves"" but these did seem to be a bit on the tight side. Comfortable and overall a great fall boot."
These jellies are extremely adorable and remind me of the early 90's but unfortunately they are not cozy at all.
Kind of small backpack. Didn't work for my 9 year old.
"Bought these for a very expensive pair of shoes and couldn't use them for those.  Had to find another pair as these were too
large for the good ones.  They are nice shoe trees, just hard to use."
Was looking to replace a uniform work shirt but this is actually a different blend of fibers than I had hoped for. It does serve as a great work shirt and is the right size though.
Beautiful piece but was too small in the bust area for me.
"I liked it a lot, too big for my small wrist. So I had to return, but was so cool"
I love the pattern and the material is great. I ordered an x small and the top still swallowed me whole. I'm a little annoyed.
These feel like they have a soft footbed.  I would not have ordered them if I had known that.  I prefer a hard footbed because I wear the footbeds out quickly.
"Returned as they were to small. Reordered next larger size and they are great. Very comfortable. Have a hint of the feel of those old ""Earth"" shoes from the 70's or 80""s."
"Looks like the pic, but these are really hard to put on. I dropped it many times before I put these on successfully. The post is short so beware if you have thicker earlobes like me! :)"
"If this were longer, it would be THE MOST PERFECT SWEATER. It is a bit too short for my liking."
"This garment is cute, decent fabric. BUT...the sleeves hang almost to the floor. There was no rolling our folding sleeves up. Material very stretchy. I sent mine back. Disappointed."
"Not as warm as it should be to be a snow socks. It let my feet cold, while another brand socks did a perfect job to keep warm while skiing."
"A little longer than I was expecting.  Some other reviews indicated buying up a size because of the width, but I had no problem with the width (although they were a little long).  Being longer does not affect shoe's usefulness for watersports."
"Ordered April 26, arrived May 06. Feels more like a M instead of L.  The hook stick out too far and snag my sweater jacket.  Paid $20 and will keep it."
Good casual bra - very light support.  Don't like the scratchy lacing all around the item and the plastic loops for the shoulder straps.  Will not buy another one.
Good overall. I wish they were a bit longer.
"Looks different and I like that, but the numbers dial goes way too slow and won't keep up with the lower analog, which has stayed correct to the minute so far.  Even after one hour, the upper dial is off by about 45 minutes."
Smaller  than I  expected. Nice color and shape.
these guys shrink a lot so order a size up.
This is a very soft sweater.  It fits really nicely but it is made from very thin material. Everything can be seen through the sweater.  I wore a cami underneath it and my bra could be seen with the camisole straps.  I would suggest spending more money on a different sweater that is thicker and will last longer.  It seems that this thin material will wear down quickly with use.
"Being a traditional cotton guy, having a ""shiny"" pair was different. But hey they do everything they should -not sure of the wear I will get, but cotton does tend to fade after a few wash cycles."
"I had to return them, I usually wear a 9N and these Bella Vita Chelsea boots were too wide.  I had never ordered this brand before, and because they were made in Italy, I thought they would fit."
"I loved this bracelet when I say it and I couldn't wait for it to come in, I guess I should have read the description closer because I didn't realize just how tiny it was.  Barely fit around my wrist, and I have a smaller sized wrist.  Should be labeled as a childs bracelet...I had to return it..."
Got this for my 2 year old baby cousin. he was coming out of size 5 into 6. so decided to get him the 6.5 it fit him just perfect but won't last him too long. i guess he has a little bit of broad feet to. so it completely fill out the shoe. but for the length fit him exact.
"I guess you get what you pay for. I only paid about $50 for these shoes and immediately, I noticed issues with my feet, ankles and legs. Prior to these shoes, I purchased a very high end ASICS gel shoes and they were one of the best I've ever worn, but I didn't have the money to spend $180 on a pair of tennis shoes. So, I bought these hoping they would still be a decent pair. I love the look and the colors, but in terms of comfort they are just ok. I've noticed that I now have swelling in my ankles by the end of the day. I purchased 4E width and they are narrow for a wide width shoe and may be the cause of my swelling. So, I recently bought a pair of Brooks shoes and they are tremendously more comfortable than these. These are great if you want a budget shoe, but if you're looking for something for comfort, I would go with something a littler better."
"3 stars just for how cute they look. They take a while to break in, and definitely form blisters on the backs of my heels. Also, there's weird fabric (almost fur-looking) on the soles. The fabric started to come loose and picked up all kinds of dirt after walking for 5 minutes, so I took a pair of scissors to cut it away from the shoe, and found that there's a rubber/plastic sole with a cute pattern on underneath. Why it's covered up with weird fur, I'm not sure, but once it's gone, no issues."
"Pretty comfortable, but doesn't have really good arch support.  Heel little wide for a narrow shoe."
"My 10 inch tablet in it's case is too tall to zip the zipper, but works for my 8 inch"
This is an excellent quality shirt but it is way too small. My husband wears a 2x and it fit more like a small xl. I returned it.
"The bust area is very, very revealing and low cut. Other than that the dress material is comfortable and the fit is comfortable too."
Ok quality.  Chinese size tag.
"Have arthritis in my toes, thought this soft fabric would work, it didn't.  Loved the look and feel initially.  If you have ""normal"" feet you should be happy."
"The length of each pair was unequal.  They are of a very soft material, which gives me concern on longevity.  On the plus side they are very sheer and the back seam is well made (i.e., stitched, versus woven)."
"Eh....... not leather, no padded tounge, not made like they were before,  non descript box. Used to br blue REBOK box

Not real, imitation.  I still give 3 bcse hubby thinks they are comfy"
Ordered a size larger just fit  material wasn't as nice as I had hoped.
TOOO SMALL
"Nothing fabulous, but not bad. Gets the job done, I would suggest a different material if you intended to use these while working out"
It was too short in the front. I expected it to be at least below my knees. It is definitely made for someone a lot younger than me.
Seemed kind of smallish - sits a bit tight on my wrist.
Cups were too large.
"Thought almost 2 year old would love it and since it is getting to be cold he needs to wear slippers in the house.  He looooves Paw Patrol but did not love this, stuck on floor, made weird sound and he said shoes itched him.  They are now in our toy box and he sometimes plays with it.  Instead of the slippers I always put on socks and gymshoes in the house for him."
The panties shrunk in the wash.  They also did not stay in place as they should have.  They were fairly cheap.
Love but XL fits like a medium us fit so not for large breast women :(
"Ok for the price, a little on the thick side."
colors on all three that I ordered are not as bright as shown - they already look faded....
Bolero fits small.
Needed to return because I couldn't try it on
"A very nice sock...But, I ordered a 4 pack of navy socks and received a pack of 4 colors - only one navy. The description is deceiving, but I kept them because they are ARE a nice sock."
Don't hold up in was as well as I would like. Very comfortable
Shrank slightly; since it was a perfect fit when ordered it was easy to tell.  I still like it so I just push the sleeves up.
"They run small, but a great shoe. Need to offer more sizes more frequently."
"really classy vest I love the looks of it but based on the companies size chart it 2-3 sizes to small.  My boyfriend is an XL in shirts and vests so I ordered size XXL from this company to make sure it would fit or be a little big. (according to Lees size chart)

 Even this vest is 2-3 sizes to small so even if you are shopping for a small to medium man you need to go XL and pray it fits because to return something to this company is at your own expense UNLIKE most returns through amazon when its normally easy to do and no cost to you. just saying...."
Kind of boring.
Cut small. Cheap material. Lots of compliments though.
"I ordered a half dozen Timex watches from Amazon because I couldn't decide which one I wanted. When they arrived, this one immediately caught my eye and I loved the elegant/casual look about it. The metallic dark blue leather band is gorgeous and it plus the face get five stars for aesthetics. BUT, much to my dismay, this watch doesn't an Indiglo backlight or even glow-in-the-dark hands, so there's no way to tell the time in the dark, which is ridiculous, and a 1 star problem. Sadly, this one is going back."
"I will  give it 5 stars, for the beauty of the watch. I give it zero stars, when  the watch arrived today, it took 3 days as a prime member and prime product. The battery in the watch does not work. Very dissapointed!"
"The bottoms were okay, but the top is too tight. PJ's should be a little loose. I should have gotten XL, but from the size chart It seemed as if large would fit. I suggest going up one size for this product."
"The suit is ok, however the jacket is HUMONGOUS on my son. He's in an 8 in just about everything but this jacket is huge. Now, I will admit that my son is a little on the slim side but this jacket can literally be wrapped to both sides of his waist. If he didn't have to wear it tonight, I'd be returning it and ordering him another suit, more than likely a slim fit. But the last suit I got from jc penny in his size fit perfect. The company should adjust their jacket size.

Also, I didn't like the fact that it doesn't have real pockets. Not even the jacket pocket is real. It's just for show. I wouldn't mind the lower pockets being sewn shut or just there for a legitimate look, however most people do dress their kids in both a tie and pocket square. I know I do. Every time.

The price for what I got...I'm not sure about that. It should have been 30, not 40. I could live with that. I now have to take the jacket somewhere to have it altered and who knows how much that's going to cost."
"thought they would be more like a sock, not.  need a larger boot size to wear them"
"Good socks, but way overpriced.  I've had long-wearing, comfortable socks that I've bought for a lot less."
Did not last very long.  My 8 yearold wore them out within a few months.
"Not a great fit for me, not the right type of pant for what I do. Seem very durable, ended up returning these."
Clearly these run small..I typically where 11-11.5 so I ordered the 11.5. I probably need 12 or 12.5.
"Zip pocket in boot difficult to access. Zipper seems really delicate. I'm scared to open it and close it too frequently. It already seems like it will easily get stuck. Since that was the main draw of the boots, it is a bit disappointing."
"Look great but as usual for most companies, the sizing is good small. The 11 fit small and hurt my feet after doing a bit of walking. Now I don't think I can return them because they creased"
"first of all the delivery n service was good but the clarks didnot keep up to the standards the leather seemed to be really cheap quality suede even a drop of water was like a stain on it which took alot if rubbing n polishing to take it off
plus the sole were so thin tht i had to take to my shoe maker n get an extra pad in humnn i would nt suggest these shoes for someone whose got sensitive feet well i just gave 3 star for amazon but im nt at allll satisfied with the shoe"
"Got these robes and while they were cheap I guess I was expecting more. They're really nothing more than cheap Halloween costume type material and quality. I got it for a birthday gift. Strings were hanging off and the package said it comes with a throat clasp, but it doesn't. They're ok but I was hoping for something that would hold up a little better. They do seem true to size."
great socks.....didn't fit....
This is a cute shirt but runs huge. The medium fits as an xl
"Fit perfectly,  color was way off."
"I have older Levi Signature jeans of the same size.  These are smaller, snugger (if that's a word).  I was disappointed that they didn't fit like the older pair."
"See through, you can see ever part of what you should be keeping under low key or for the after party."
"didnt like anything about these, just not for me,  not comfortable on the top of my foot, and i have normal , not ""fat "" or skinny feet, felt too confineing,"
"I bought both the thongs and slide style slippers. I like the thong style even though the sole is very flexible and quite thin. I bought them with the intention of using them occasionally when traveling so they will be fine for that. The knit straps are different and cute. These would not be my go-to slipper for general wear around the house as I need more support. Even at Amazon's price I think they are too expensive for what they are, as I could buy a similar no-name slipper at a mass market retailer for half the price. My foot twisted too much in the slides so I gave those to a friend."
I have worn a size 7.5 in ASIC for years but I have to send this shoe back because it is too small. It is a nice shoe though so I have ordered a bigger size. Hopefully this is really a 5 star product when the size is right.
IM ALWAYS HAVE TO TAKE THEM OFF CAUSE THEY NEVER STAY IN PLACE
"Good quality,  but product runs larger than expected.  Had to return."
"They're ok. Length is wonderful, but they're bigger than expected in the waist and throughout."
Smaller than I realized.
"These look great, especially the cuff, but don't hold up well to colder weather  because the socks themselves are pretty thin and the lining leaves something to be desired."
"The colors are really pretty...but being familiar with ordering from overseas I ordered this a size up and it was WAY to big for me in the cleavage. I was not blessed with much cleavage anyway, lol..It made a nice gift for my daughter in law, she loves it"
it's thinner than i expected and the brown is so dark it almost looks black but i'm wearing them regardless
Larger and wider than expected. Will need very thick socks to fill them out.
"I like the watch, but it was not working when I received it."
"Cute shoe, and lightweight.  Fit nearly as expected, although a tiny bit narrow.  When they came in I tried them on and liked them so much I immediately ordered a second pair while they were on sale.  But I found out halfway through the first day of wearing them that it is like wearing a plastic cover on my foot - it does not breathe at all.  They are also a bit lacking in arch support, so my feet were aching by the end of the day in addition to being soggy.  When the second pair came in I used the free return policy and sent them back.  I'll get some use out of the pair I kept by wearing them on short outings.  But for a pair to wear to work on dressdown days I'll have to find something else."
This is a super cute shirt for the price but runs really small. Im usually a small US size and I ended up needing a large!
They are very high for me.
"The fit is a little bit small on my chest and shoulders, but other than that the fit is nice. The design is really cute, however after a few wears and washes the graphic began to crack and peel. The fabric, as well, felt very stiff and scratchy. Overall, the shirt wasn't really a hit for me. I love the design though, so that made up for all of the cons."
This pair fits smaller than other similar RL sandal.
"The shirts are too big, so I can't wear them! I'd like to buy them again but in a large size. Not an XLL!"
"I liked that I could make these shorts long or shorter if I wanted, but they were a bit big but not bad!"
"EXCELLENT FIT
HEM TO LONG FOR PETITE FIGURE
TOO LONG"
Shirt was too small. Had to give to my daughter.
"So sad! I have received this coat as a gift for Christmas. It is beautiful and obviously well made and well finished, but the fit is VERY small! I normally wear a small, so I ordered a medium to be able to wear a sweater with it, but I could barely put it on! It was way too tight in the shoulders and arms. Would have loved to order the next size up, but the price almost doubled in the meantime.... I would recommend to buy at least 2 sizes up."
"This umbrella is cute to look at. It is safe in the fact that you can easily see where you are going as you walk. However, it is difficult to open and is frustrating if it suddenly starts raining and you cannot make it function. I was disappointed but will keep and use it."
The band felt rough and uncomfortable. Changing the time and dates was a bit of a pain as the knob didn't pull out right
My husband loves Keys however these fit perfect around the waist & length but the thigh part of the pants are too tight.
Quality has gone down A LOT over the years and the price just keeps getting higher. They are very comfortable though.
Great design and look but I was disappointed to learn that the parts I had assumed were leather are man made materials. In my artificial leather does not age well and is prone to tearing in applications like this so I was disappointed.
"This is the third Fantasie brand bra that I've tried, and I think they're just not for me. The wires don't feel to wide, and yet they manage to push everything back towards my armpits. It's not flattering. I also had a lot of wrinkling at the top of the cup (but I think a size smaller would have cut in). The top edge of the cup doesn't stretch very much.

If the fit will work for you, however, the quality seems really good."
"After loading this purse with the items from my previous bag, it just didn't feel right our have the pockets in the right places. I needed to return it."
There are these flower motifs on the side of each cup that can actually make the bra uncomfortable after a while. Or maybe I'm just sensitive.
Very comfortable. Fit exactly.
"I really like the jacket.  Unfortunately, it's much too small/"
"came as expected. fits good when the strap is adjusted.
doesn't look too bad but one part of my hat keeps caving in no matter what i do.
got too lazy to return it because i think it might be faulty but other than that, i like it."
Nice all cotton short but they are way smaller than when I got them a year or two ago.
Not what i thought it was gone to be
"Clasp extremely hard to undo. Seems to run slow or keeps losing time. Going to replace the battery, which hopefully fixes the problem, but shouldn't have to replace battery within a month of purchase, in my opinion. Otherwise, a great looking watch."
"lightweight corduroy, handy style.  great with boots and sweaters."
"It is ok, not complain."
too small around the toes
They rub on the joints of my toes and hurt. Bought for my wedding so trying to stretch as much as I can before I wear them and my toes get hurt. Wont buy again although its a beautiful looking pair of shoes.
"Fits good around the waist but is a little bit too long, fabric is okay, I thought it would be thicker for sweatpants. The ""burgundy"" is actually like a bright red. They are comfortable though."
"I bought these when they were on the daily special.  They are very cute.  They do run a little small.  I like my slippers big so I bought the 9-10, I usually wear an 8.  They fit like they were an 8 so I suggest buying a size larger than you need.  The slippers themselves are very cute also.  I notice though that they have a very tall (I'm not sure how to describe it) sole.  I am not crazy about that.  They are not the most comfortable slipper I've ever worn, but they do keep my feet warm.  I don't hate them, but I probably would not buy another pair.  My granddaughter loves them though because they have hello kitty on them and keeps stealing them."
"i did not buy this for post-partum I bought it for general back support -
this one seems very well constructed but it probably not great for my intended purpose - I own one other post-partum binder that works very well for my needs but this one is probably best just for its stated purpose
it is well constructed - feels like a good quality item and also the double velcro straps that allow two levels of compression is a great plus
i have a 27-29 inch waist and i ordered the Medium and it is too big - likely because it is meant for post-partum and not for what I wanted to use it for

it arrived quickly and is packaged well

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review  For almost 10 years Ive relied on amazon reviews more than anything else when buying items online and my assessment of the item is based solely on my experience using it and desire to help others buy the products that work for them! [if you found this review helpful click below - happy shopping :) ]"
The top of this set sits oddly on the shoulders. The bottom of the shirt is snug and the straps constantly slip off. The skirt is adorable and fits perfectly. It also has a built in diaper cover. Ive used the skirt many times and the top only once.
"Haven't taken any other size than a 9 for years and years, and these run large and wide. To be able to wear had to buy inserts."
Very tight in the arms area
MEH it was okay. Material feels cheap and doubtfully will wash well. Bought this instead of costume due to cost & I figured my daughter would wear this more than an actual costume. She didn't like it.
"Pretty, but sort of small. If you are looking for something elegant and understated this works, but I am not sure I would suggest it for a bride in a formal and fancy wedding, but it would be beautiful for a bridal party or a very understated bride!

I had wanted something with a little more flair, but this still worked out. The chain gets tangled fairly easily, but other than that it's nice! The earrings are comfortable and the chain itself on the necklace is a nice length.

This would make someone very happy if it's what they are looking for!"
"Ordered a Large , was sent a Small.  However , the small did fit barely  regardless -  Color was superb , Printing was bright.  good quality T-Shirt for boys , washed up nicely.  only wish it was the correct size LOL"
"Didn't fit around my calf comfortably. I'm shorter than the  "" average American women "". This measurement isn't included in the info.
I ordered  the shorter version of these and they ""work"" fine."
"Great Cap (quality-wise)! With all due respect to Chinese manufacturers ... why the heck is it soooooooooooo damn small?! Why? I've got several BB caps (Gap, Nike, etc.), also made in China, but that one's for freaking dolls, really!"
I ordered a 3x and it is smaller than all of the other 3x shirts that I own.  More motivation for me to lose weight I guess :)
"While I love the color, this top looks nothing like the photo.  It just looks big and boxy making me appear heavier than I am"
"The straps are way tighter than the other reefs I have and they rub and make blisters.  The reefs with cloth straps are more comfortable.

Also the foam on this is harder than other (older versions of) stargazers."
"Pants are soft and comfortable.  However,  the stitching in the left thigh started to give out after I washed them,  and I had not even worn them yet."
Looks like a boat on my son feet nice shoes butnot a great idea for online buying
Nice glasses but a little on the small size for progressive lens but very good looking eye wear.  They were shipped in a favorable manner and packaged well.  Brand new and shinny.  They also have the spring at the sides.  Really nice and comfortable.  The price was good too.
"The feathers look good, the middle piece is a little weird and not removable. The wings themselves are very small. The back is made of cardboard, so I imagine not much longevity. Overall, okay for what it's worth."
"Love the pattern, but look on the Darn Tough website for a better image. The yellow is not so neon.  They do twist and fall down. The sock is very slippery I have fallen in these at least once and slip constantly."
"I saw the sizes ran small so I ordered a large. I usually wear medium shirts and the large is nearly too tight. But I do like the colors and how it fits overall. The only thing that was unfortunate was only 3 of my shirts were a large, the 4th was a 3X which makes no sense to me. I tried to go through the process of returning it to get the correct size and it was too much a hassle. I'm just giving the 3X to my mom, it's a little bit on her and she wears a large/XL depending on the shirt"
wanted reg. got tall....
"Good  fitting  ..good quality.,,,value  for  money..But  there  is  something  I  really  hate...!!!!!
Showing  different  color  and  shipping  another  color  ....(even if  refers on descriptions that  assorted  may  varying in colors) I sitl
consider it  as  misinformation  .Just take a picture  of  the  exact product .. buyers  will  really  receive..It s  not  good  policy  for such a great company as  Amazon  is...!!!!!!"
I'm really disappointed in this pair. They are comfortable and look great just like all my other pairs but this one started falling apart almost immediately. The sole started pulling away from the front part of the shoe the first week. It continued to get worse. It made a brand new pair of sneakers look like trash.
"Beautiful,but small."
the socks are too long but fine
"First of all, I did not realize this was reversable when I ordered it. That is not necessariy a bad thing. It is not 1"" it is more than 1 1/4"". Not high quality leather, feels very slick to the touch almost like rubber. I wear a 34 size waist and the length is good. I don't know if it is really worth the price tag."
"I'm using these shoes as bridesmaid shoes and as someone who does not normally wear heels ever I would say these aren't half bad. They were definitely not designed for someone with wide feet and I was a little disappointed that they didn't have a wide option, but that's fairly common I know. Just know if you have wide feet order at least a half size up."
cute sun hats!
"Ordered a 10, for my husband that wears a 10 1/2- 11 and they were a little small for him. I thought they were pretty nice but he did. It like them because they have open holes. I thought the holes were covered with a mesh, but they were not. That means that sand, and gravel will get inside the holes and inside your shoes which really defeats the purpose, unless you are only wearing them in the water. So we are sending them back. Just be aware of that and order your exact size.
We received these at a discount for an honest review."
It's medium on all sides and it looks too baggy.
Cute enough but fit was huge.
"The earrings are pretty and light, however so long they rest on my shoulder."
I only deducted some stars because it had a really weird smell. I hand washed it before I gifted it for Christmas and my mother loves it. But that smell was bizarre.
"Ok , too boxy
And color not like the black shown"
"Returned, look cheap and way too small."
not really comfortable.
Average quality and the length of the sock is a bit short.
"My feet are wide and these are not. MAybe i can break em in,cool color but doesnt really go with much."
Small and couldn't fit beach towel and swimsuit which is why I bought it.
"I have several pair of these shoes, and this one--with the faux snakeskin--is the only one that's uncomfortable and sometimes painful at the back of my foot in the heel/achilles area (I'm pretty sensitive, so it might not bother the average person.) I'm fairly sure it's because the material used to make the snakeskin part isn't as forgiving as the regular leather on the solid versions."
"Received socks on time, fits great until I got to the thighs... I'm 5'4"", 160lbs. My thighs were screaming for release... Will not wear these as I thought I would. Will keep at the knee. I was looking for warmth during the winter time. These will do though. Thin material yet, not cheap. Just fyi. I purchased the largest out of the product just to make sure I could fit them."
love the hat..way to big and way to flimsy to try and reshape .
This jacket runs small. It's very cute but the fit is not right.
Quality seems much cheaper than another one I bought for the same price but just one piece.  You get what you pay for :/
Typical belt.
"I've been running daily for years in Ravenna 4, Ghost 6 and Dyad 7 and I guess I expected the Glycerin 12 to be at least as good if not better. I was disappointed. They have a flat feel to them. Maybe they are better on longer runs of >5 miles and maybe they'll get better as they break in. If they do I'll come back and rate them higher. Right now I'm just not impressed."
"Fabric is kind of thin, but I'm just happy they fit me OK."
It's a huge bag. I figured that the flap had a zipper underneath but it doesn't. It's almost like a giant turtleneck is connected to my purse. Canvas material seems sturdy but I have worn it out pretty quickly
"A friend of mine wore these shoes to work and she said her pair fit fine. I found them on Amazon and noticed that some of the reviews complained about them not fitting and hurting their feet. I always wear a size 9 and don't have different size feet. But when these arrived, one shoe fit fine and the other the leather was fastened a little closer on the toe and it didn't fit comfortably. I kept the shoes because they are super cute, but uncomfortable. I am hoping they will eventually stretch out, but last time I wore them they left a blister. This is the reason I am posting them as just 3 stars. My friend however, who has a narrow foot has no issues and she has three pairs in the different colors. Definitely don't order a size smaller if you ever toggle between sizes."
The wallet is made of good quality materials and well made.  The problem is the money clip is too tight and I haven't found out how to loosen it without breaking or damaging some part of it.
"The purse is cute. The metal pieces are sort of gold(ish), not super silver as in the picture. I find my items getting lost in the bag, and it's hard to look because you have to hold he top open to dig around in there. It has a tendency to stay closed.  I think it's a great ""occasion"" bag (church, dinner, date night) but not for every day. You have to always hold it in your arm, which is ok for ""occasions"" but not shopping or picking up your kid, etc.  The straps are too small to go on your shoulder.  It does come with a single removable shoulder strap, but I don't think it looks right with this style.  It does sit nicely on the counter when you set it down.

It is good quality for the price. I paid $39.99 for it, and now I see it's on sale for $25.99. I wish I'd paid that. That price seems like a better deal for this purse. I'll save it for when I go out, but I got something else for everyday."
"Cute boot, way too small! Order at least 1 to 2 sizes larger than normally needed"
"The earrings themselves are fine, but I received a pair that are stamped w/the weight? on both the left sides, so, no matter what you do there is an exposed stamp on shiny non-forgiving plated wanna be silver."
I'm a size 7 and these shoes are too narrow at the toe.
A little to small
"The handle broke on it during my first use. However, it happened when flying so I don't know if it's the bags fault or someone was rough on it. I think it's a bad choice to fly with, too many straps and handles to get caught on things. It's now in the landfill. I do admit that I liked it before it broke, but probably won't buy one similar."
"Jeans will fit as ordered, however I have one disturbing piece of info.  The jeans wore down within 6 months and split in the crotch.  They were not overly tight at all, so only thing I can put this to is poor manufacturing and materials.  Buyer beware here!"
"This used to be my favorite brand of leggings, however they really stretch out after a few wears and don't bounce back.  These are ok as pajamas but are not a nice, fitted legging, at least not on my body type."
"Kind of short, tends to ride up. Otherwise comfortable and warm."
"and then one of the underwires broke thru in the front.  So now, if I wear it (because I keep forgetting it's faulty and because I'm desperate for one that doesn't cut off my circulation), I get stabbed in the chest when I bend over because of the underwire sticking out..  I think I may try sewing over the hole to see if that works.. or it will just break thru beneath that because the material is so thin.. who knows.. LOVE the fit around my chest tho.. the cups are a little large but the band is so amazing.. It has been a while since I've worn something so comfortable band-wise."
My husband likes canvas belts.  The belt lock doesn't seem to work the best.  It either falls open or he struggles to get it to lock.
"I ordered these a size larger than the ones I have, but there didn't seem to be any difference in size. They must run smaller that the dickies I have. Other than that I like them."
Really nice shoes but they are too narrow even though I bought the wide. Sadly I had to return them.
they run a little big and aren't as WARM as one would hope. it was only 32 out and my toes were freezing
"The arms are long enough for me, and for half of someone else's arm, but it's not big enough to fit around me.  I'm worried that an extra large's arms will go down to my knees.

Lovely coat, Good quality.  I'm really apt to keep it, and leave it open. I live in Texas and it's use is going to be rare, and possibly only esthetic anyway. It feels great, looks to be well made. The belt is sewed on, so it can't be removed it you don't want it.  Also, the latch is ""gravity"" operated, so if you are very skinny, or want to belt it in back it won't stay together.

I think I'll keep it and adjust me to fit it, rather than try to get it to fit me."
Pretty but the cup sizing was small. Didn't work and had to return.
Nice slipper...quality fine.... nicely shipped.  BUT NOT GOOD FOR SWOLLEN DIABETIC FEET...
The wig could've been made better. But it worked for its purpose.
"I am, erm, big-boned, so I opted for the large. I was swimming in the top half of this costume. I had to modify the ""cape"" because it was sized for a woman with either EEE breasts or the lowest chest ever. The cape itself was disappointingly small. I highly recommend wearing pants or stockings or yoga shorts under this if you don't want the world seeing all that. The hood was WAY too big for my head, so it also had to be modified so I could put it up and still see/eat/drink while wearing it. The fabric itself was surprisingly nice - it looked and felt good. I'm not sorry I bought it, but I wish I had had more time to modify it better so it wore more comfortably."
A bit tight and much shorter than pictured. Fabric is extremely thin also. Works better as a beach coverup than a street dress.
"I have to admit, I am not crazy about this suit. The quality just isn't there in the material. Had high hopes. There is nothing wrong with it, I didn't get a defective product, its just very thin and no really very much like swim suit material at all. The fit is difficult to comment on because the top is extremely unflattering. I will not be using the top, but may use the bottoms."
"Good looking watch,,just not a sturdy as other Casio watches. Too bad, like their brand."
"The sleeves were made too short so they stick straight out off my shoulders. It's sort of awkward to have sleeves so far out. You will need to wear a camisole under this shirt because it is see through. Also, it sticks to your body on dry days sue to static electricty. Be warned about that. It can be quite annoying"
"I do love these crocs as they are really cute and feel nice underfoot, the reason for the 3 stars is that the rivet at the back of the heel busted out the first time I tried them. I was able to change them and my second pair has been just fine."
not good size
Made a little cheaply.
I ordered a size 9M since that is my size and i find it a bit on the small size. I wish that I had ordered a 9 1/2.  When i realized this it was to late.
"Had to return, too large for me."
Beautiful necklace but pendant is too small. Good for a child. ONLY one sided stone.
The line holds clothes well and can handle reasonable weight only if the line is itself attached at both ends to someting solid like a door knob and a heavy chair. The suction cups are inadequate and provide no benefit at all.
"The color on the screen looks much more yellow than what was recieved.  Otherwise, they are lovely.  However, the color was what I was going for and it doesn't really make it."
"Dress was way too large on me and looked frumpy and sad. I really wanted to love it, but it just wasn't going to work on me. I am a shapely size 14/16 (42x35x48) and this dress did nothing for me. But customer service accepted my return without incident. Kudos for good service."
"Fits small M 5-7 fit a toddler 4t-5t . the color is beautiful, bright blue just like the picture. But there are several loose threads, opening the bag there were puffs of extra fuzz and a weird chemical smell. Its not very full definitely not worth the price."
I liked the color and the fit through the waist and thighs. I didn't like the extreme snuggness through the calf area and the stitching on the back pocket came unraveled. Im disappointed with this pair of Levis.
"they sag in the leg,,,,,,but i am thin also"
Very small elephants (5) of them.
"Too loose, not supportive enough"
"Not as comfortable as I would have liked. I bought two different brands and of the two, these are not my favorite."
"The 6T bikinis are the same size as other brand 4T bikinis. They have held up reasonably well, but there were two pair we threw away after a single wash/wear as the elastic began tearing out. The cotton is very thin and somewhat see through, but since they are inner wear and not outerwear, it's okay to be a bit thin, These do fit my tall/slim child better than my shorter/stockier child, but they can both wear them. I would not necessarily purchase these again, but I wouldn't send them back."
"This was super cute. I thought the arms would be long enough for me though (5'10'' with monkey arms) and they weren't.  I gave it to my mom who loves the fit, however after one wash, the color on the top of the shoulders is white."
"These are great winter boots.  Although wear a 7  but had to order a 10 for them to fit loose?  They run VERY small.  For extreme temperatures,  you need a boot that doesnt hug your feet, therefore feet will sweat, defeating the purpose.  Not happy with their sizing, considering what they cost.  Great boot overall though."
"Not wide enough, Too narrow. Makes it very difficult to put the shoe on. Love the design, but ended up returning. Length of the shoe was fine."
Smashes chest area to much
Didn't like the material and it is a bit larger than expected
Get the iron ready because you will need it.  Not wrinkle free.
There is nothing wrong with these shoes. They are just a size too large for me so I can't wear them.
The sides ride up a little bit. I hate feeling confined so I don't wear it much.
"The skirt itself is cute, but it is way too short for an office setting. I got this as part of a Minnie Mouse costume. I will be returning."
"Only the band gets cool.  It does help, but unfortunately it doesn't last very long.  It might work better for protecting and cooling a bald head."
TO Small
"The baby came 3 weeks early :) I was so pleased to find preemie clothing available especially on my prime membership.  A few days later, the kids called and said the outfits were shorter than newborns but wider.  We still love the outfit and will keep it.  My suggestion for preemie shoppers is educate yourself on preemie clothing specs."
"I liked it better when it had a plastic clip, but I am in the minority.

They are also using a less effective velcro configuration than they originally did.  I love the design of this item, but don't care for the leather quality or build at all....just wish someone else would try their hand at this item.....it is a superior concept."
"It's cute, but not as big or stretchy as I thought it would be"
"Returned, quality seemed very good, but way too large."
These pants are not near as  nice as the same pants I bought 6 months ago from amazon online store.
I thought I would be purchasing something a little less confining. I have the maiden form the is more control but wanted something a bit less constricting. I will use anyway
"Pros - all cotton, all black
Cons - attract a crazy amount of lint - literally unwearable without using a lint roller first"
I returned these because they rubbed my heels and caused blisters. They fit fine other than that. I loved the style. Super cute. But just hurt too much.
"The jacket will be useful for running around when it is misty.  I have not yet tried it out in real rain, so don't know how waterproof it is.  Based on other reviews, I had bought a Large, normally I am a size 10.  The Large is too large, but might be useful with thick sweaters underneath.  I won't exchange it, but I would say that it is sized normally, not small, as I thought some reviews indicated."
Didn't like the large opening at the ankle
"Received this costume in the mail today.  My niece really wanted to be Pikachu for Halloween 2014 and this costume was perfect!  I am only rating it 3 stars because there was an ugly black smudge on the dress that will need to be cleaned.  She wished it was ""ready to wear"" straight out of the package."
"Pretty color. The elastic on the sleeves was very obvious and looks odd when on.
Definitely fit more like a small or x-small and was a medium."
"Very cheaply made in China. The lenses aren't even polarized. They actually look so cheap they look like a huge pair of kiddie sunglasses. The case is impractical, you can't fit it in any purse that is reasonable and it is cheap too. I feel ripped off. This being said I really wanted white sunglasses with this shape that wouldn't snag on my hair if I pushed them up on the top of my head. These will do that and I do look cute in them. I still think they're cheap but I am wearing them until I find a replacement. I would not recommend anyone spending their money on these glasses. They are worth about $12 at a gas station at most and that is including the case."
"Wig will not fit an adult. It barely fits my 3 year old. The wig capit comes with is worthless, just buy another one. Need more of a snug fitting cap since the wig is small. The wig will serve its purpose for Halloween."
"It was way too large, and clumped around when I walked. Get a half size smaller than you usually wear."
"Sick has a grip on the heal but it still falls off all time, it's annoying"
Runs VERY small. Not as cute in person as in the pictures.
"It is a very cute set. We tried it on my son as soon as it arrived to make sure it fit for an upcoming wedding and it was great to see that the suspenders worked perfectly. Unfortunately, the tie broke almost immediately. When we went to adjust the size it slipped right out and cannot be put back in. The set cost as much as others were charging for just a suspender or just a bow tie so it's not a big loss. We just ordered another bow tie from a different vendor."
Not as comfortable as Fly London shoes usually are.  Disappointed in fit and comfort.
Cheap price in this case means cheap belt
While the shoe is comfortable its a clown show compared to other minimalistic shoes on the market. No way you could wear this with a suit or slacks without a red nose and kids screaming at you.  Its even odd with jeans...
"This scarf is 100% Polyester, not silk. Looks cheap."
These shoes are great because they add a touch of glitz to my work wardrobe BUT they feel and look a little plasticky and if you don't wear hosiery they make a lot of noises when you walk....so since I got them on sale I'm keeping them but not worth paying over $25.
I had an identical shirt that fit perfect that I found at a pro shop so I ordered 2 more. The armholes are huge on the 2 shirts I just received and causes huge gaposis giving a clear view of a fair amount of my bra! Why are they made like that?? Other than that it fit as expected but it's not something I want to wear
"Cute shoes, but flimsy.  I wish they had more support cause I can't wear them long."
"Quite functional, except the face is smaller than I expected from the photos."
"ordered for my daughter size 3, she said top way off and didn't fit at all but bottoms were cute...she kept it for the bottoms."
She only wore it a few times before the decoration started tearing off.
"This is cute, but the front is way too loose. It must have been made for people over six feet tall. I'm 5'8"" and it's a no-go."
"Website states 98% cotton 2% spandex, actual pant label states 100% cotton. No stretch in these pants."
pants are not loose fit.
A little tight. I wear a size 10-11 so I bought a medium.. It creases at the midsection. I looks great when wearing it but it's not very comfortable for more than a few hours. It does show under your clothes.
The cushion in the sole seems off. Like the style though.
"Love the color, it's a gift and I think the quality is good so far. Definitely has a western feel to it. The material feels really nice as well. Definitely worth the purchase, receiver of gift happy. UPDATE: 2 purchases made, one as gift, one for myself. I used this bag on a mini vacation and believe it or not the nice trimming is coming apart. It's not like I went on some African safari...no rugged abuse took place in the wildlife. There was no fricken wildlife kinda vacation it's mellow and we walked ate and took in some sights. Basic stuff. I hope the other purse fairs much better because it was a gift and I only went on a mini vacation for a week. Its a shame the purse isn't better quality. So I deducted stars, because it is a nice looking purse but quality is shoddy."
LOVED this but it turned after FIRST WEAR. Beautiful for ONE DAY!
I bought these for my newborn. They were way too big for her head and still are even though she is now over two months old. She is in the 50th percentile for head measurements so her head isn't tiny either. Cute looking just don't buy them thinking they'll fit a newborn or young baby...will be great once she does grow into them though.
"Laces were great for a couple months but then it broke off and had to order another pair, trying a different brand now."
THE BASE IS NOT STABLE.  IT WOBBLES WHENEVER USED.  THE BASE SHOULD BE MEATIER TO WITHHOLD THE TREE [ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S LOADED WITH EARRINGS!]
"I have been professionally measured as a 38 E. I ordered the 38 H of this bra and the cups were still too small. I also found the clips and straps to be so wide as to be uncomfortable. Going to go up a band size and see if it helps. There is also a design flaw in that the entire bra is made of spandex, since the front stretches as well as the back the wires stretch towards the sides losing some of the cup room, if the front was made of a fabric that didn't stretch I think this would fit correctly"
Ordered silver or white gold. Gother yellow gold twice
"this does not fit as XL. If your size is normally XL, go at least  2 sizes up. I wear L, but this XL was snug around my 38D."
It didn't work
Run a little small. Will not buy again
Cute outfit however the shirt was too small for my daughter
"Similar to other Tri-Mountain shirts. Their ""Bigs"" narrow down at the abdomen / waist and do not provide you the room as other shirts that are sold as ""Big"" shirts. I ordered two - 3XL Bigs and the chest was fine but the lower body was tight.  If you go up a size they expand the neck so muuch that they look sloppy then."
These shoes are not as comfortable as previous Go-walk shoes. I regret buying them.
"Not so great, my girl liked it."
"I love my beach pants to be big and lose, so I ordered a larger size than what I wear and the pants fit very tight :("
"This is a hand bag, not shoes"
"I wear a size 8 wide.  Most Skechers shoes fit perfectly, but their steel toes are not wide enough.  Some of their styles are wide enough, but not many.  I definitely recommend going to a local shoe store and trying them on before buying.  If you wear a regular or medium width, these will likely fit fine.  Furthermore, width excluded, these shoes have a very comfortable sole.  Excellent for standing on your feet all day."
"Too big for my newborn, flower fell off right away with no use."
The size medium runs very small. Package said for a size 8-10 and it's more like a 6-7 maybe a small 8. I have a 10 year old who wears a 8-10 (very slender figure) and the dress was way to short and very tight in the arms.
"A simple, inexpensive t shirt but you definitely get what you pay for. The neckline and hemline are roll stitched, very thin bands, so they wrinkle up a bit when you launder the top."
The brim was a little short.  But a nice comfortable fit.
"I bought these in black from QVC and they are adorable looking.  The footbed is fantastic, as one would expect from Earth shoes.  I have other Earth shoes and really love them.

However, these shoes are rather tight in the vamp and don't seem to loosen up with breaking in.  Also, the cut-outs on the heel section really tend to rub the heel.  If there were no cut-outs there, it would not be a problem, but between that and the tight vamp (and I don't have fat feet, but normal to narrow, actually) I ended up sending them back.  Love Earth shoes, but these could be improved."
"My bad...this has no carrying strap, and black is too manly for me. This is made of faux leather. I am giving this case to my husband."
"The top buckle cuts into my ankle badly, even after wearing for a day with bandages. Otherwise pretty shoes."
I just got the watch ahead of today. The face is the perfect size. The problem is the band stuck out and would not flex around my wrist on the top and bottom. the brackets would not allow it. The screen was also very hard to read even in the day. I really like the color but had to send back.
"Comfortable, somewhat large."
Thin but soft and cute.
Customer service and Shipping were great but runs too short in the torso area. I am 6 ft 7inches and it didn't go below my belt.
"I had to return the backpack because it was too small for my laptop. My laptop was 17"" and there just wasn't enough room for it to slide in. Now that I have a Surface, I think it would be perfect."
Cool nose for a costume. However the material made it smash down flat so you didn't really get the correct effect and the strap was way too long for a child.
"Shoulders fit a bit odd (too wide and capped around the neckline). Otherwise, a lovely dress, just an odd neckline fit for me, so I returned it."
Cute. Little small. And I  have tiny feet. It's the length of strap for buckle. Too short to allow any adjustment. Kinda nice but in no way were they worth what I payed for them. Live and learn.
"I am used to the more slick work out shirts. Those do not show sweat and are a bit more gentle on the pecks. After running for ~40 minutes with this shirt I had to stop to avoid real pain. As a regular shirt, they are fine. Would not recommend for runners unless you take necessary percussions."
It's... weird. The material is too thick. Looks much better in the picture.
Love the colors! They are a bit narrow in the toe but since the cushion in a bit in the insole you can not tell . However I am only giving 4 stars as I had to go to a shoe repair toget the bact strap tightened. Super loose bedfore it stretched.. was going to have strap fixed to make tighter but tailor said it was so cheap it would just fall apart. will be returning
"Not quite as wide as it looked, but ok."
"The bra is a little bit small but I am not sure a larger size would be right because it's that kind of bra, sports bra type. My problem with it is as others have noted that seam does itch, not so bad that I won't were it but it's annoying, that's why 3 stars. The size was alright I knew it was a sports bra kind of bra and would be a bit tight."
"The arms are tight, sleeves are short, pockets sit high around the ribs, the button is sewn on a strange area & material is super thick & heavy, also not machine washable. I am 57 38c 165 lbs"
looks good but not good enough build quality for the price.
This is the first pair of Merrells I'm not crazy about and I have 15 pairs.  I had blisters on the backs of both heels after wearing them for a two mile walk.  The
"thats shoes its ok. not great deal, I just thing that is better quality for this price and mark. ok"
I'm gonna return for a larger size
Does not have 6.5 and 6 was too small. Returned.
"The style was nice but the XXL that I ordered fit like a M. I'm 6'4"", 230, muscular build...shoulda known better."
"One thing I don't like that skirts have been doing lately is the liner that is visible and from the picture I thought that that would not be the case with this one. I was wrong. that it the only reason I didn't give it full starts. I think that the sizing was fine. I bough a small. I am 5'1 and a more muscular build in that my quads and butt are my problem areas with bottoms and this since it is flowy, fit fine. I also have not had a problem with the quality. i took it traveling abroad as well as I have washed it many times and it has in no way fallen apart. If you're okay with the lining then it is good for you."
"The trim looks really cheesy in person. I also thought the sole looked/felt weird, not rubbery enough."
Definitely not true to size. Runs very small. But very pretty
"I would like to rate higher but since I wear these around the house night & day most days of the week because I'm retired I think I have received my money's worth. The slippers have had a lot of use. Next month will be 12 months since purchased. The sizing was good. Medium was OK for my 8 1/2 size. They have been very comfortable. I'm used to a slip in but using a shoe horn became routine. The tightening elastic feature was not of much use for me. The 1 st weakness was in the bottom sole. It is not full width. The outer sole is 1/2 inch shy of the outer edge. If you can picture the outer sole as being a 16th inch thinner all around the sole from outer edge for 1/2 inch inward. Saving plastic? My weight caused a separation in these areas so that you could see daylight in crack in sole, in heel & under ball of foot. I inserted a left over inner sole from old Avia sneakers. That is still working but I just ordered a new pair of Isotoner slippers from Amazon. I would recommend these if you don't wear them full time (indoors only) as I did."
"The fabric is very clingy, which does not work as well in a solid color as it does in a print.  The tunic arrived very wrinkled, and even after hanging for quite a few days, it is still somewhat wrinkly.  given that the fabric is a lightweight synthetic, I would not dare iron it.  So ""OK"" sums up my assessment."
Didn't like the fabric and also the length for my grandson. So we had to return it.
They are huge lol but cool depending on where ur going
"I like the lightweight of this watch and the BIG numbers to  easily tell time! I am disappointed the battery has died and watch is not yet 6 months old!!

Update 9/14: BUMMER! Now the watch is defective after Service sent me a new battery, the watch stopped keeping accurate time.  My jewelry has determined that the watch is defective and not worth repairing.  Repairs would be more than price of watch!  Nine West won't take proper action to make this ""right"".  If within 30 days of purchase, I know Amazon would have returned it!"
I think these are really intended for younger girls.  I have very thin legs and when I put them on the threads broke immediately.  Its a shame too because I purchased quite a few of these.
Cool lightsaber except it doesn't light up.
"I really love this belt.  When I received it there was a vertical cut in the red leather on the front of the belt.  I returned that belt and ordered a replacement.  I received another red belt, but not this style.  The replacement belt has a standard belt buckle, I don't like it nearly as much as this one.  I am disappointed, will try to exchange again."
"What can I say ... it's a cheap costume!  Ordered for my 14 yr old dtr who is 5'7"" and appropriate weight and she wears a size 5/6 in clothes.  We ordered a ""large"" in this costume because, well, costume sizing is known to run extremely small.  The large barely fits her!  Material is thin but, once again, it's a costume."
the very tip of the toe on the left shoe is beginning to come unsewn after only wearing shoes a few times.  I will likely be returning them very soon.
"However, the band was too large for my husband so I am returning it.  Other than that we both loved the style of watch and wish there was a way to have the elastic band altered. There was nothing in the instructions that came with the watch that had anything on elastic bands."
I love the way this product looks however the fabric is a little cheap.
"These are light socks, not very cushioned and the gold toe is only across the top, not the entire toe.  Furthermore they were small, definitely not 9-11, more like 8-10 shoe size.

Overall ok but would not buy them again since I really wanted cushioned SOCKS, not cushioned liners"
"I had high hopes, but this just didn't look flattering.  The bottoms were very busy.  Too much going on.  The top mesh portion wasn't as sheer as I was expecting, and just didn't work for me."
Not as sturdy as i hoped it would be.  Which was too bad because it's totally cute.  I was even stopped in public by a stranger asking where did i get it from.
"This bra came up in a search for a bra, post breast reduction.  As comfortable as it was, I do not believe that it fit the bill for that purpose, for it does not have any compression.  It was large on me ...the shoulder straps were quite loose...but it has only been a week since the surgery.
I do wish it had a little more compression, because it is more attractive than the sports bras I am going to be wearing for the next several months.  If you do not require a lot of support, I bet this is great.  It certainly was comfortable.  I'm sorry I had to return it."
"This accessory is built well but the chain is super cheap.  It is a nice size but if you want to wear this without worrying about the chain breaking and losing it, get a better chain."
"Changing my review--product SHRUNK in wash, lengthwise, so now it doesn't go as far down. Doesn't seem to have the same shape or fit as well either. It changes the look, sadly for the worse. I washed normal cycle, in warm water.  :-(  I'll still wear it but not when I have to go anywhere, it'll be an in-home only shirt. Bummer.
***
Good quality, nice fit, deep colors."
"I was disappointed in this shirt. When I opened the package, the actual shirt part had a snag in it from the front to the stitching on the side. Especially for the price I wasn't expecting that."
My wife is 5'4 110lbs for her i guess it was either too loose or the cut was just weird. I think this is for more curvy women and not necessarily fat but curvy or plumped i wouldn't recommend it for slim or skinny women
"This shirt runs really small, make sure you buy a size larger than you need"
Had to return. Truly a Plus Size.
they are somewhat small but will work.  my son has had this size previously but these seem to fit smalller.
Quality looks very ghood but was torn on arrival will reorder
"Too small I normally wear 36 waist and this pair fits a little too tight, I order another pair of 38`s  I will get them tomorrow and try them out, I hope they fit me. LoL."
Very good pair of jeans  but i should have ordered a loose fitting as the waist size is perfect but my thighs are a bit big so it looks tight on my legs
Just Ok.  The only reason I'm not returning it is because I wore it for a couple hours.  I will not be purchasing this again.  It just was not flattering on me.
"Just what I was looking for.  This backpack is lightweight, super secure and will hold enough for my trip to Europe including a 15"" laptop.  The back has a light pad which is very comfortable on the back.  I also thought the color was great, Not too blue not too navy.  The green on the inside looks slightly obnoxious in the pictures but it is not at all in person.  It is bright enough so finding items will be easier when looking inside.
I wish is was slightly more feminine to carry every day for work but it is not masculine like others I have purchased.

Updated review* on 5.26.16
I went to pack the backpack for my trip to Europe and I couldn't fit my belongings into it.  I was trying to carry sandals, ipad, snack, purse, water bottle, cosmetic bag, etc. There are not a lot of compartments which you don't really notice until you go to pack.  I am so disappointed that this did not work!  I will return because of the high price."
"I love this style and the faux carbon fiber appealed to me bc the last 3 other brand wallets I've have were the same style but less wide.  Like the photo shows its wider than a credit card.  My other styles were not as wide as this.  So my takeaway is that this wallet is wider than others in the same style, like compared to Fossil brand.  But I like it and have used it every day since I got it."
I didn't think that these were very comfortable.  I work 12 hour shifts on my feet and these just didn't cut it.
The sizing has been wrong every time I've ordered these. I'm so confused!
The're cute
"I really wanted to love these, but felt they were very unflattering. Nice fabric, soft and thick, though! I don't wear things that make me look lumpy anymore. Why bother?"
"Great bag if you like old school bat bags. For the price it does what I need it to do. Keep in mind, if you hang it on the fence all your smaller items will sink to the bottom and become very difficult to retrieve.

No outside pockets or storage which sucks."
Cheap material but its for kids
Socks fit great right out of the package but after washing they did tend to shrink a little. Will purchase one size larger next time
Description says Leather but they looked like rubber to me. Returned because I wanted something a bit more stylish
"Well made. Beautiful color. If you have a belly, be aware that the pleats in front will definitely accentuate it. If it didn't have those 2 pleats, it would be very flattering since the black band really minimizes the natural waistline creating a more hourglass look."
"These were a very pretty black suede, with a nice profile.  However, with high arches, they were also very uncomfortable as there is no way to adjust the straps enough to not push on the top of my foot.  The buckle was not very usable - I could not get them to open easily, or adjust the straps as I put them on."
Not bad for the price of 4. The only thing I dislike is that the bottom rolls up.  I did still order 4 more colors though for the gym.
I buy a size 12 shoe & thought the large size would fit.  Unfortunately the sizing runs smaller than indicated on the chart.
"I normally tak a 91/2 and these 11s are actually a little too short.  Order large.  However, they are very well made."
"I got these for a really good price during an Amazon daily deal.  I've been wearing Brooks Ghosts for a while for my running but heard good things about Saucony and for the price, thought I'd give these a shot.  They fit well and are a just a little bit lighter weight than the Ghost 6's I mainly wear now, but don't have as much cushioning.  They fit okay but felt slightly larger (barely noticeable though).

Keeping these for shorter runs but will stick my Brooks Ghost."
"Good quality but not as small as I'd like. I'm 5'6"" and the tights fit right under my bustline with lots of extra fabric for my long legs.  I was hoping they would fit a little more snug but they fit more like leggings."
"I ordered a medium for work and it is way small in length, like erkle small. And the waist is tight . It also states pewter grey but it's more like a light grey. Instead of the regular dark pewter grey you can get at a store.  Do not recommend these pants"
NOT BIG ENOUGH TO FIT ALL MY CARDS AND MEDICAL INFO TOO.  I'LL TRY A RFID WALLET.  THE CLOSURE WASN'T STRONG WHEN FILLED  EITHER.  COLOR WAS GREAT.  MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER LIKE THEIRS BUT  WILL ONLY USE THEM FOR CREDIT CARDS AND ID.  THEY CAN CARRY TWO WALLETS IN THEIR PURSES.  IT'S HARD TO SIT ON ALSO.
"I love the feel of these, but I don't have much of a butt, so these leggings do not stay up. I found myself pulling them up most of the day."
Just OK.  A belt.  With holes.  And a buckle.
Lovely Scarf HOWEVER the one edge was not finished which means the scarf can be pulled apart and has not lasted well when worn.
"This is the 1st shirt I bought through Amazon & will be the last.  The print & color are as pictured but the quality is much less than expected.  The fabric is very thin & while it may be good for summer wear, I have concerns about long-term wear.  I considered sending it back but hope that my husband will use it for layering since the fabric is thin.  I'm used to good quality LL Bean t-shirts that cost about the same as this one did so I find this very disappointing."
Good for crossfit. Velcro is a bit stiff though.
Somewhat narrow for my foot.
"They are comfortable but I overestimated the size situation and got them too big. I also don't see how the waistband could be flattering on anybody... Wish it was a bit more flush to the shorts. I took these on a trip and after a day of weird tanlines I switched to regular bikini bottoms! The material is quality and in no way see-thru which is great. I'd recommend them as a workout short over a bathing suit short, unless you're wearing a full tankini top or t-shirt!"
"I bought this for a red Pebble as the stock strap started to crack.  It looks okay, but it gets dirty really quick.  I've only had it a week or two and it is covered by skin cells and other detrius.

It's not because of sweat (a common complaint of this type of watch band) and actually feels fine on my wrist.

It's a little flimsy, but for the $20 price I'll overlook that."
Doesn't fit against my forehead so therefore the sweat grooves don't work correctly.  Fairly heavy.
SON LOVE THIS ROBE... WASHES OK GET BALLED UP A BIT....
Nice studs but eventually they will change color.
does not fit as pictured
"Nice but the top is cut weird. I think if you have big boobs, it may not work for you. Its cut very wide. Other than that the dress is very nice. A little on the thin side. Wanted to return it because of weird cut but I didn't make the return policy cut off. I will have to figure out how to wear it."
I love these slippers except for the sole. There is no structure to these slippers. The slipper foot bed is very thin so you can feel everything that you step on. The tops are cute and warm but the bottom of my feet are freezing.
"You will need to break these in for a while. They are somewhat comfy, but a bit too snug for me. I still use them, but only if I know I won't be standing or walking for very long. I don't recommend these as daily walking shoes if you have slightly wide feet. I'm not sure this product is available in wide, but you should check that out even if you have narrow feet. It's VERY snug at the toes and could possibly lead to bonions if you're using them daily. Be careful. Treat your feet with love and allow them to stay comfy."
This ring doesn't look as shiny or as silver in real life.
not what i expected. but i made it work. i could of built a better  one..
"These pants looked so cute online, but in real life they are not nearly as flattering. They squish your backside to the point where it doesn't look natural. Plus they are sized pretty small. I am a pretty skinny girl and usually wear a 3. I bought the 5 and the 3 and both of them were weird fitting and too small. I bought my 12 year old a pair in a size zero and they look pretty cute on her."
"Very pretty bra and I like the padding (not too much or too little), but it is a little large in the top.  It's only minimal, so if you are a full cup, it probably isn't something you'd notice."
This small bag is a nice size if you want to go small - holds a lot and keeps it organized.  The 'leather is only on the outside
"This bra was somewhat small. I ordered my size based on the size chart, but unfortunately when I tried it on, I was already on the last hook seeing. Also, the padded inserts were perfectly round and it was noticeable. Without them, the bra was a little thin for my comfort (I'm small chested and prefer a little padding and details help.) I returned the bra in the end. The quality was good, the fit just want like my VS brass that I'm accustomed to."
"This is a cute hoodie , it runs a little small so be careful on the size choice.  Love the color and I purchased it for a Pre Teen."
This product made me look and feel great.... but after five wears it had holes and runs and was unwearable. Will probably repurchase though because the the use I got out of it was amazing
"This necklace was bought for a photographer friend as a gift.  I'm debating if I want to give it to her or not. The idea is cute, but the charm looks NOTHING like the picture. It looks VERY cheap, like it came out of a gumball machine. I know I can't expect much for the price, but I have gotten other costume jewelry on here for less than a dollar, that looked a million times better than this! Buy at your own risk."
"Really nice looking shoe and felt good on except to big around my heel, foot was sliding out as I walked. Had to return them. Also, the toe area felt a bit tight, almost like cutting into the top of my foot. however, i could not walk in them so not sure if they needed to be broken in or just the shape of my foot vs. the shoe. Color/leather very nice. Style very cool with the split, almost like a thick sling back.
Sorry to say they had to go back."
"If these weren't so cute, I'd have returned them.  They flop around and clop around.  Worst case I will wear them as slippers."
"I Like it...the only thing is with the 3x, the shoulders don't fall quite right because (it looks like) they didn't widen the open part across the back of the neck and line it up with the shoulder seams.  So, basically, the part that goes across the back of the neck and the shoulder seams must be a one-size-fits-all pattern and the rest is just adding fabric to the front.  I'll still wear it but it doesn't fit as I'd like."
"I am 5' 6"" tall. My measurements are 34/26/33. I am on the petite side and wear a size (2). I think this Shaperqueen 102 Women Waist Cincher Girdle is a great idea. I don't need something like this, but I am creative with my wardrobe and I thought it would be fun to take a crop tank or bra top and turn it into tank by wearing it with this Shaperqueen. I knew it was tight so I ordered a size Large. I could not believe how tight it is still. I'm not even kidding when I say that after pulling it all the way up, I looked at myself in the mirror (I DON""T have any tootsie rolls) and I saw NO MATTER how thin you are it still cuts into you at the waist ""giving"" you fat rolls even tiny ones. It does NOT give you a smooth look like the picture. WHY you say, because it runs way too small! I look like the girl in the picture, same waist. If you look at the sizing, you can understand why they carry size XXXXXL. I only weight 117lbs. and I have to order size XL to get a smooth look. So don't torture yourself thinking this is the way it is for me. Order three sizes or more bigger for real!  Hope this helps! : )"
I have several pairs of Nine West shoes. This is the first pair I have ever returned.  I did not like how the shoe fit across my instep; much too low for my taste.
Good quality but just didn't fit my feet.
"Cheap, affordable, came quickly. Bought as a christmas gift for a young sister. Chain came in broken, just fixed it myself."
I got the size wrong. And the skirt was too small for me.
They are okay.  Son likes them.  Not as supportive as I'd like.
I use Large (L) size clothes and I order this dress on a XL and it was still somewhat small... For other customer who want to buy this dress order it two size bigger and it will fit...
"It was really cute, it shipped on time, and of course it was inexpensive. I wore it almost every day, but the problem is that I wore it so much it got all discolored :( but what can you expect from something as inexpensive as this? Other than that I really like the bracelet and still wear it"
They are a little big. I am a 7.5 no problem but these don't fit as snug as they should. I am going to buy the something to put into them to make them fit better. I'm pretty sure ordering a smaller size won't fit. They shoe box was damaged. There were parts of the purple on the box peeled off on top. The shoes also had a few scuff marks. I was able to get them off but wasn't too happy that they weren't perfect when I got them. I did get an incredible deal on them so that makes me happy.
I normally wear XL but this was way to small than a normall XL.
"Beautiful color and fabric, but the quality of fabric is low. The cut is quite baggy for a modern fit."
Came with scrunched up nose :(
"thin material, was disappointed at the way these were made. they are best for just wearing cause its chilly out. NOT good for playing outside in the snow, my son had cold wet hands. They are very thin, just the outer fabric and then plastic which was supposed to keep it all dry but that plastic does not help at all..."
Though it's cute so I ended up giving it to my daughter to wear
"Updated my review. I loved this bracelet until I saw that the beads paint chip off. It's not a pearl. It's a plastic bead that is painted a pearl color. Also, the oyster shell's silver finish rubbed off and  looked black. That didn't bother me as much because it almost looked more like a real oyster, but having a weird bead with chipped paint on it made me not want to wear it ever again. It looked nice for the first year, then the 2nd year things went downhill quickly. Wore in almost every day to work so I'm not too upset with the product quality.

The bangle part and 3 little brand charms are still shiny though, and looks new even though it's 2 years old."
"BOTTOMS TOO LONG, SHIRT TOO SMALL, MORE LIKE AN XL NOT XXL."
Pretty but beads seemed loose. Bought two bags of supposedly different brands. Same hardware. The other bag had its handle brake first use. If I had kept this one I have no doubts it would break as well.
"It has a slow developing hot spot on my left foot.  My feet ate problematic anyway so this issue may not hold true for the others but for me it is a deal breaker.
Interestingly, I have other Saucony and the logo strapping on those do not create any such hot spots. So I assume it is located off of where it is on other pairs. A flaw in my mind"
The pair I received may have been a display model. The cardboard forms inside the shoes were the same foot (dont recall which). One shoe had a couple specs of red glitter on the sole. The cloth lining in the ankle was loose and folding. Sent back. Not new as described.
Color is a bit dull loking but still nice.
It's cute and the color is bright which makes my legs look really tan but it rides up so I was constantly pulling it down.
These ran a little large. Sole wasn't as comfortable as I expected.
It's kind of large
"Like most toddler undies, they feel like cardboard. But my son likes Olaf, and he doesn't complain about them being itchy or anything, so they're OK."
"I bought this product based on my experience with a different syle purse organizer.  Although the product is as described it is not quite what I was hoping for but I'll manage.  I like that there are two sizes and that I can now organize all of my purses.  The quality of the product is also very good.  The downside is that the compartments are all around the outer edge with one large compartment in the center.  I think if the center compartment had more sections (like a cutlery tray) with less sections around the edge, I'd feel more organized.  I'm considering another style of organizer from the same company which I think is very good."
Really upset that they color is more of a blue color then it is a hunter green. It looks like a aqua color not a green. A great shirt really comfortable will order more in other colors
The sizing is fine except the length.  A bit short on my teeny= tiny- 3rd- percentike- for -height daughter.  Will outgrow length long before the dress itself.
Not as good as their base layer T's fit small and the length (shoulder to butt) is short.
The balance not good. Very shaky
These were okay--just not quite what I was looking for.

I really love this necklace!! It is super cute and elegant.

One thing I was kind of sad about when revieving this product is that my name doesn't have a letter C in it and that was the letter on the necklace. Other than that I really love this necklace.

This necklace would be super cute as a gift for your friend or really nice to wear for yourself. Either way you go with this necklace it is so precious. The quality is great and it won't change colors.

I love that each product from this company sends you a draw string Bach to keep it in, it really makes it easier to keep up with considering how small the necklace is.

Disclaimer: I revieved this product complimentary for testing purposes."
A little squeaky when I walk/run....other than that comfy
The shoes are not that comfortable for being real leather. :(
iT'S HEAVY ON A CHAIN
"Nice for the price. True to size. The only thing I didn't like was no matter how tight I made them the cutouts were large and even crinkled... it's like there was too much material on the shoe.... I still like them. Wore them to a wedding, received compliments and I will wear them again, just not very often. Oh, I get irritated when shoes are shipped in a bag. They arrived with crinkled and a white pressed line in the material. I overlooked it bc you kinda can't be the price."
"These are very attractive and well made; however, the fit was not comfortable as there was hardly any flexibility.  The heel is barely there and they were more like sandals than a shoe that I would wear outside to take the dog out.  I would recommend a larger size as mine were tight."
Actually looks A LOT different in person and when being worn than in this picture. I still wear them and like them but they do not look like the picture when wearing.
I probably wouldn't purchase again. The water stays in them too much and doesn't seem to drain easily.
I like the shirt its cut to small ill have to up size it so fits right
"I want to love this skirt, but the colors are so strange. I originally ordered the black and white skirt but the skirt is clearly navy. The waistband is black, but it is a totally different ""black"" than the skirt. I didn't want navy, so I ordered the ""blush"" color that looks pink online. Nope, not at all. Blush = ORANGE. That was hideous so I returned the ""blush"" and am now stuck with navy."
"These shoes are ENORMOUS and I even sized down a full size.  The ankle straps are similarly huge and I'm soon going to have to poke new holes in the straps so that they will stay on properly.  I was hoping that these shoes would be a little bit more graceful and less utilitarian-looking. The blush/champagne color is great and the sandals are very comfortable, but look a bit too Peppermint Patty for my taste."
The size I normally wear was to big. I went a size smaller and they were to narrow.
Smells - still airing it out - good size - haven't used it yet.
"I have found the bracelets from this brand to vary in quality. I have one that I wear almost daily, but I returned this one because it was strung very loosely and the elastic didn't feel as robust as in the other one. However, the stones are always high quality. I still recommend this brand, even though some bracelets are made better than others."
This shoes fit great but its hard. The material is tough
"Surprisingly, Altra has wide toe box but this model ran more narrow. Had to return for refund"
I bought this coat and had to return it even when it was the right size.
"Fortunately I took others advice and ordered a full size down from what I always wear...still none too tight.  Could probably even have gone down another half size, but amazon doesn't go that small.  (I wear an 8, ordered a 7)  I'm not a fan of back zips, but thought I'd give these a try, because I'm searching for gladiators with arch support.  Still not a fan of back zippers, but the shoes are kinda cute.  My problem:  one shoe seemed to fit well while the other was too large.  On both, the top of the zipper dug into my ankle.  Don't know if the leather would adjust to my feet in time or not, but for $129.00 I don't want to take that chance.  My search continues."
Was swimming in them.  Didn't come in the smaller size I needed.  Also it cost me more than double to send them back.  Very disappointing.
I really like the concept but there is a thin padding in them that is much too small for anyone except a small person.  I am a 34/36 B and the bralette fits but the insert isn't wide enough.  It is one piece so you can't adjust it.
"Purchased for my son, a beret wearer, and it was OK. Shipped on time. Found that he prefers the military-style beret, which I purchased from Amazon, so that skewed my review.."
Saving it in case I can shrink into it.
"Not pleased. Sent the wrong size, it was too big."
Probably my disappointment was the product was for men and I am a woman who could not find high tops for myself. The feet were big and the ankle was small. But they were fun.
"**Pros**
Stylish
Thin Material

**Cons**
Stiff
Not wide enough
Hard to put on
Too tight (not tall enough)

Let me start by saying, we're a barefoot family. We have extremely healthy feet because we rarely wear shoes. However, we do know shoes are a tool. When the blacktop is too hot to walk barefoot, it's great to put shoes on. Since my son has only worn shoes a dozen times in his 3 years of life he has really wide feet, nicely spaced toes, and a high arch, which makes finding shoes difficult.

Shoes should be flexible to move with the natural movements of your feet, they should be comfortable, not tight and not loose. These shoes were none of those things. My son wears a size 9.5 shoe, so I ordered a size 10. As soon as I got them I thought they were absolutely adorable. Then I pulled them out of the box and immediately tried to bend them frontwards and backwards and they were so stiff. I held out hope that maybe it was just because they were new and I should try to work them in. I did that for a bit, but didn't feel like they loosened up any.

We had to do some errands so I let my son wear them out. I forgot to take a picture of them as soon as he put them on so you get a picture after a day of going out and getting them nice and dirty. They were extremely hard to put on over the top part of his feet because the tops of his feet are really tall, I had to stretch them as far as they could go and still had to (unfortunately) shove his foot into it. When they were on he had a difficult time walking in them because they were so stiff. He has never stumbled (except when he was learning to walk), but these shoes had him tripping a few times. After a couple hours of wearing them we came home and he immediately wanted them off, but couldn't take them off himself because they were so tight. When I pulled them off there were indents on his feet from the shoes squeezing his feet.

Overall, I think the shoes are cute, but they're not for our family. I do not think they made these shoes with the health of your feet in mind.

During a promotional period I received these toddler shoes at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
"Really beautiful, but chain is very short, for an adult women. Appears longer in picture."
Great. Nice design and great sturdy material.
"Length of these jeans in black is shorter than other colors of  the same style and size:  black 27.5 inch inseam, blue 28.5 inch inseam, white 29 inch inseam.  All labelled 6 petite at time of purchase.  Blue and white purchased in May 2015 from JCPenney.  Fabric of black is also scratchier.  Cut slightly looser in leg."
Beautiful Shoe..... Size fit  maybe a size smaller than I ordered.  Had to fix it with a shoe stretcher... Now it fits perfectly.... should not have had to do that  though....
Runs big to nice looking shoe; suggest you get a half size smaller than usual.
I use to only by bras from Labe Bryant. they were strong and sexy but these new batches cost more and don't last as long. So I am trying new companies. I ordered up a cup size just in case the bra runs small. Thankfully I did. A little concerned about longevity of the bra. Will update later on how long it will last.
They are cute. Wish I could wear them.
It's goog
It's really pretty but I almost lost it a few times.  Had to return it because the clasp keeps breaking on me.
"I really wanted to like this necklace. It looked beautiful online and was what I thought would go well with a formal dress I'll be wearing next month. However, after trying it on, it just isn't worth the $35. The leaves are fabulous, but the chain is pretty terrible. To the extent that I had someone else come to same conclusion it looks like a chainlink fence. Perhaps if I had bought this for a different reason or had long hair to cover the ugly chain up, I would have kept it."
I wear 12 in all other brands.  12 1/2 needed in this ASICS shoe.  Naturally no 12 1/2 available in granite/black/malibu.
I ordered this in an XXS thinking it would fit me since I am very petite but it was still too big which is unusual.
"It is a good T shirt and I like the feel of the fabric. It is too long. If you are tall it may be fine. But I am 5'4"" and it is way too long."
Very nice but my husband had to give them to me. The Size was the problem so make sure you know what your buying.
"Jacket fits as expected, skirt is too tight.  Too bad it didn't work, it was cute."
"Fine craftsmanship and design,the fit was as expected.
The reason for only three stars is that the stone is heavily veined with black and not remotely as pictured."
"Even though I ordered a XL,  this seems smaller than expected.  It is quite narrow all over.  I also wish the material the was a bit thicker, nicer."
"Im 58 and weigh 150. I bought a medium and its definitely not a dress on me. However, its a cute top with pants or longer shorts. Very soft material, just not a dress."
"Nice fabric but too big. I got the 924 relaxed racer tank style. It is WAY too long. I got a size small.  I am 5'3, 127 lbs, size 32DD bra.  I normally wear small or medium. Small was too big. It was much too wide and long. I decided to return it.  It was a nice material. Other than that, it won't work for me."
"I like the big caps, but the wife didn't. So, I had to get rid of it."
"These shades look cool and the price is unbeatable, but you kind of get what you pay for. The frames fit me very snuggly so I would imagine if you had an even slightly larger head you would be in trouble. The worst part about the glasses are I found the metal nose rigdge to be quite sharp and stabby if it is positioned on your nose at a certain angle."
"Like the shoe but it is quite narrow and seems to run small.  Usually wear an 11 but required a size 12 in these and they are still too short. I ordered a 2nd pair when the price dropped under $40 (paid $70 or so for 1st pair on a lightning deal)
They seem to be closing them out (the style).  You can always return them if you find they don't fit."
Shoe size runs big. Felt comfortable and light but half size too big and the toes box seemed very wide.  Returned and ordered a half size smaller.
Somewhere cheap in feel and looks Gave them away
Not what I expected. I was trying to replace a pair I had bought a few years ago and couldn't find the same ones so I bought these. They are too tight and not as comfortable.
"A little tight, biggest complaint is the weird stitching across the belly. Really looks weird to me"
"While these sandals are very cute, and quite comfortable, the soles are slippery.  I had to scuff them up in order to feel stable in them."
Fits more like a 36DD. The wires poke my armpits making this an unwearable item.
"This was the costume my 6 year old wanted, so I ordered it despite the bad reviews, knowing the wig might not work out.

The body piece is very nice! Soft and comfy, fit perfect, looks just as shown. Little straps hook the footie portions onto your child's shoes so they stay in place. Velcro is used to close the back.

Now...why the wig was bad:

#1. It looks nothing like the picture. There were not nearly as many ""rows"" of hair and certainly not in the style shown. They also don't come apart like the picture. They are firmly glued together.

#2. It doesn't fit the head right. As a matter of fact, if she put it on the way it was made, the ""hair"" stuck straight out the back. Not from the packaging either. We gave it a few days trying to get the hair weighed down and work some crafty miracles. No good.

#3. No matter how we tried to position it, there wasn't enough of the wig to cover her head and the ""bangs"" were in the middle of her head. So even if the hair did hang down, there wasn't enough to cover the whole head and would have looked ridiculous with the front half of her own hair showing.

Our solution:

We bought an entirely different wig that was a slightly lighter purple with a lighter pink bow in an adult's size. My daughter was a little disappointed at first since the color wasn't as dark, but once we put it on, she loved it. Ordering the adult size gave the exact same impression as Lalaloopsy hair since it was over sized and it was still purple with a pink bow just like Pillow.

So 3 stars for the great body piece. Minus 2 for the fact that the price I paid was really just for that and a wig that went to the trash.

Give yourself some extra time to do a little shopping around and find or make your own wig! In the end, it worked out great and my daughter was very happy."
Somewhat cheap. Not too bad. Fit well.
The footbed is great but the top part of the sandle does not go back far enough and hurts when you walk and does not stay on well.
"I'm a little disappointed by these. The colors are pretty muted, and setting sticks out really far. I'll still wear them though."
The shoe is very beautiful but am giving it a 3 star because it was higher than i expected. I thought i could still manage it but i had a sprained ankle the very first day i wore it to church. i cant walk around comfortably with heels that high.
"It is large enough to fit everything I need (laptop in fabric case, 7 pocket folders, multiple manila envelopes, Yeti mug, water bottle, pencil case, planner, chargers, a few books, lunchbox), which is a lot. However, and it's probably my fault, it does get really heavy. It does seem like it'll hold up well and stay sturdy, but it scuffs VERY easily. I don't know where they come from, but every few hours I have a new white smudge on my black bag. It comes off if I scrub it with a wet hand towel, but as you can see from my list, I don't carry that with me. So it looks nice and professional until I apparently bump something with it."
"A little cheap looking, but still cute. It'll do for now, but I'll probably be looking into buying a new backpack soon."
Pretty short.
"I have an almost identical ring and the blue fibers are so vibrant, but the ones in this ring were barely visible.

I had to return it because I accidentally ordered the wrong size, but even if it fit I would probably return it simply because the blue fibers were so bland looking."
This would be a 5 star product for the price but there is this zipper in the back that was sewn on terribly so it bunches up and makes the back of the dress look doofy. If there was no zipper it would be rad. Maybe other dresses have been sewn properly and I got unlucky but for the price I'm skeptical...
"The picture shows the arms to appear more FITTED...but the arms all the way down are larger. I guess this is good if you like to layer up underneath your jacket..but I would have much preferred FITTED arm sleeves.. 3 stars for that. Also the stitching on the inside where the inseam at top of shoulders is POKES. Kind of feels like little needles..I can't wear any tanks underneath because I know it will irritate my skin from the stitching. I'll wear it...but doesn't feel that cute on...feels ""alright"". Pretty disappointed."
"I bought these to wear in the garden to avoid no-see-um bites on my feet and ankles. I would order a full size smaller. I'm a true size 8 shoe in virtually every shoe brand. My feet swim around in these but since they're just for the garden, it's not worth the hassle of returning for a smaller size. Except for the size, they are a great quality and no annoying biting insects can get  to my legs and ankles with these on."
"Looks great at first, but the fabric is too cheap, even at the low price. After only a few washes, it's starting to pill and is no longer wearable in public. It's a real shame because it's a great looking piece - fits well on my pear-shaped frame and is also comfortable without LOOKING comfortable ;)"
"On my feet all day as a nurse and need sturdy shoes. These are well-fabricated, nice materials, but get a little loose and could use more arch support. And, how about some colors besides white and black?"
"Read lots of reviews to get these, and I'm disappointed. People who said ""supportive"" really should have said soft and squishy, which is different. If you're under 30 and under 140lbs, these will work fine for a good amount if walking. If you exceed either number, buy real support shoes."
"I have a wide width foot and followed the instructions given to order a half size larger to fit a wide width foot. I normally wear a 9.5 wide, so I ordered a size 10. The foot bed was wide enough and the length was good, however the shoe was too tight around the top of the foot... There was no room to even wear a lightweight sock. It took some effort to even get them on with no socks -- It would be impossible to put them on with socks. I had hoped to wear these at the cabin in the muddy fall and winter, but not without socks.  I love these shoes and would like to order a size 11, hoping that would work, but they are not available in that size. So, I'll be returning the shoes. They appear to be well made and the print design is adorable, but they just don't fit my wide width foot."
"These looked like they were very well made shoes and I think they would have been great if I had been able to wear them. I ordered a wide and they were marked wide, but just one look at them when I took them out of the box told me I wouldn't even be able to get them on my feet. They definitely were the equivalent of a medium width, so if you need a wide shoe don't bother ordering these. If you need a medium width I would order the wide. I had to send mine back."
I usually wear size medium but I bought small. I forced into this one week post partum and i was  so happy with the perfect curves i had! it was very tight but i didn't keep it on too long each time and it was just what  i needed to help get  my  shape back. this worked great and i received  many compliments but the hooks are wayyy too weak and the reason i am GIVING THE PRODUCT 3 STARS. the hooks fell apart one  by one and after few months it was tossed. I wouldnt buy the ones with hooks again
Love the style and their very comfortable. They shoes had form protectors in them which actually stretched the shoe out too much. Overall they haven't been returned so :)
"Good print, buy the shirt is in no way the shape described in the picture. I had to take it in and spend a few hours sewing to get a fit I was happy with"
Liked the looks of the shoe but didn't like how it fit my foot.
"It does not work with any protective case in the iPhone.  Very snug, but the size and extra space is great.  It takes the place of most cases."
The dress fit perfectly but the material was very itchy against my daughters skin. Consider purchasing an under shirt as well.
"It's quite thin and dainty. The color is beautiful but I'm no expert in metals so I can't comment on the quality of the gold. However, it has not irritated my skin or discolored like cheap jewelry tends to do so that's good enough for me. I'm not a fan of the clasp; it's a spring ring, which seems a little cheap looking and doesn't seem like a very secure option. Other than that, I like the bracelet. I generally wear it when I'm wearing a piece of statement jewelry because this bracelet is subtle and just enough to not have bare arms without distracting from anything else."
Doesn't give much lift
"I wore for second time, I can see the peeling has already started and I always wear boot all day long, yet this disappointed me how for very second time i wore it , and it has already looked it aged over 2 years or so. I cannot even wear any socks in this one and I ordered a size larger. :("
"I wear size 8. These slides for sure don't like to stay on my feet. These slides are only good for walking around in the house, not for running errands or walking to classes...etc..."
Very comfortable....poor support.
Cute and looking forward to wearing by the pool.
Ive always been an advocate for Asics running shoes and have had much success with them; however these cross trainers have been the worse Asics I've purchased.  The band around the shoe didn't work for me whether I wore thin or thick socks; it was just too tight for walking and exercise. I was attracted to the style and price. Ive decided to give the shoes to someone who likes them and look for a better shoe.
Very cute but the material doesn't stretch at all so it was very uncomfortable for my son to wear.
i like the t shirt but it looks nothing like the picture. it does not have the distressed look at all.
Serves the purpose but not very durable. It weakened with frequent wash. Cute designs though
A bit tight.  Comfortable though.  Quality looks good so far.
"I've been buying the string tie version of this shoe for years and thought I'd try the Velcro tie version. At least for my size 13 the Velcro straps are too short, every time I remove my foot from the shoe the top Velcro strap pulls out of the slot, which requires re-inserting it through the slot each use and defeats the convenience benefit of the Velcro option. good shoe but I'm sorry I switched to the Velcro tie option"
"This is see through, so i purchased a slip so they i could wear it to work. Fit was as expected. I was a little disappointed that the back was just Velcro. It was a good price and served its purpose for our Halloween event."
"Item is just too small for my 19mon old baby..:(  I would like to return it, but I'm not in US, and shipping cost of returning it would cost me more $$$..."
"Quite well made and sturdy, however these tend to slip down my nose quite often. I assume it's due to the nose guards being made of rubber rather than plastic. But I still do very much like them as they are very fashionable  (love the little side detailing) and functional in shielding my eyes."
"My 2.5 year old wears 3t, size 8 or 9 shoe, but the 4t-5t socks were very tight!"
"Very aggravated with this seller AND this bag. This seller obviously re-sold a defective bag which had already been returned to him at least once. The inner lining on the outer pocket was coming apart, not just a little bit...it was completely separated from the leather that it was lining. Now defects do happen, I understand that, but I would expect better quality control on a bag in this price range.

But what really got me po'd is that there were 2 keys on a small key fob inside one of the inner zippered pockets. These had nothing whatsoever to do with the bag (nothing on it was lockable), and one of the keys was marked Thinkpad, which I believe is for an IBM laptop case and the other looked like a brass locker key. Obviously, someone purchased this bag, saw the defective lining and returned it...but forgot to remove a set of keys before sending it back.

And then this seller got the bag back, repackaged it and resold it...to me!

BAAAAAD seller. I contacted Amazon, since this item was fulfilled by them (but sold by Maxton_Men) and Amazon issued a prompt refund and a small courtesy credit for my trouble.

So that was my issue with this seller and his sloppy sales practices. Now, the case would have been satisfactory if not for the separating pocket lining. The slots for credit cards are done well as is everything else except for the defect. If not for that problem I would rate the bag a 5."
Sleeve too tight
"The color is cool, but the luggage itself doesnt hold up well. Bought December 23rd 2017 for a January 2018 trip. 2 out of 4 wheels on the 28 inch piece were missing on flight back home. Paid for 2year warranty, but no one answers customer service and if you file a claim with Asurion , they say your luggage is under warranty with the manufacturer."
Ran big in size
"Love them, but should have size up...Twice! I wear a 6 and i should have gotten a 7!"
Good quality although much smaller than I expected for the price paid.
"Very nice looking, elegant tie bar - but much too wide for today's tie styles.  My husband couldn't even use it for the occasion we bought it for although he kept it as someday wide ties may come back in style (and it's a pain to send back... )"
I got the large because large is what I wear but... these fit between med and large. Especially the pants part. They show the crack even when standing.  It's a shame it's too late to return for a larger size
shirt fit great.  A bit of an ordor from the screen print
"I really like the way this fits around my waist but it didn't do absolutely anything for my boobs, didn't hold them up or anything and it's also very short if I didn't have a tank top underneath you'd see my stomach poking out under. I really love the back of it though."
"This necklace is very pretty and delicate - an ideal Valentine, token of love, or anniversary present for those of modest means. It would be a delightful surprise, if a fragile one. The chain is quite fragile, so one must not count on durability. Its being 'plated' should not be misinterpreted as if it could pass for anything except reasonably priced costume jewellery.
It can be a very nice present, and the box is attractive, and seems to have come straight from the jeweller's shop."
"On the plus side this is not a bad looking piece of jewelry.  The gold plating looks good and there is no problem with the chain even though the fastener is a bit small.  Of course there will be differences between each piece, but with the one we got there was no sparkle with the lower stone which, thus, had a rather flat look.  All we showed it to - including our twenty some granddaughter, thought  it was OK but not at all exciting.  No one thought it worth $100, or for that mater $50.  It was too plain for a  formal piece or a fun piece;  although with better (and bigger) stones it would have served better for a formal occasion."
"I'm 5'6.5""  and weigh 125lbs. the length was very nice that I can even wear to church. It was not tight at all, but I put a belt around my waist and that made it look much better. It was not flattering before using the belt. All in all I would buy again."
"Pattern is cool, but the color is much lighter than shown. It's more purple than black"
"I'm giving these shoes 3 stars for two reasons:  1) they really smelled strongly of whatever dye they use to color the shoe, and 2) after a few months (so probably ~50 times worn) of wearing them to the office with very little to no walking since I mainly work from a desk seat, they seem to be wearing quickly where the leather is losing it's rigidity and the sole is losening. In contrast to some other $50 pairs, there is a clear quality difference."
Not the shiny material i thought it was based on the pictures. Used for post pregnancy to regain shape. They worked well for that purpose.
"I had to fix the lenght of the pants. The textile is very sinthetic, and pretty noisy when walking. For the price quality should have been better."
"Looks better in the picture than when I received it. Returned right a way.

It appeared to be made very well but I will never know as i found it to be ugly."
"OK. But the waistband was a bit tight. Husband has always worn a medium in undies. Also, the pouch was still not generous. The legbands were raised and played Pickaboo on both sides into his nether regions. Think I may try another brand. Fabric is super soft ad nice though!"
Fun but difficult to style.
Very nice and soft quality but the fit is small. Seem a size smaller than usual.
Nice looking but way too large. Gave it away as I didn't want to have to pay for the expensive return shipping as this is not from Prime.
I am in between I don't like and it is ok. The design and material is good. The arch support hurts after a couple hours.
This stretches out a whole lot.  Just be warned.
I thought this wallet was going to be mint color with a coral orange. It turned out to be mint with orange. It still looks super cute!
"It's a one size fits all type deal it look amazing on the model but on me no so much my body measurements are 34, 29,40 so I guess u can say I'm bottom heavy so it's a bit uncomfortable"
Not what I expected but my friend loved it for herself
They are decent sneakers but don't help with my planters factious. They do run big so you can put a orthotic in it but don't work on their own.
I like the color and the size of the wallet but the leather looks fake. :(
I PURCHASED SEVERAL OF THESE JEANS FOR MY HUSBAND THEY WERE OUT OF THE COLOR I USUALLY PURCHASE SO I PICKED A DIFFERENT COLOR  THEY ARE NOT! THE SAME JEANS THEY DON'T HAVE THE ORANGE ZIPPER AND STITCHING THE OTHER PAIRS OF A DIFFERENT COLOR HAVE AND THEY FIT A BIT TOO LARGE FOR HIM. THEY ARE OK BUT I AM  DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE OTHER COLOR FIT HIM SO WELL.
Pretty but doesn't quite match the outfit I was going to wear it with. Will be good for making jewelry though.
"meh. Did not dislike it enough to actually return it. I've worn it once, but as far as cold shoulder styles go, this is not really the same category. Should just be called ""cheap sweater with huge holes"" which would be a much more fitting description. It's also a bit short and the material is not all that great. I think it is overpriced for what it is, but again I did not go through the motions of actually returning it, so at some point I will probably wear it again. It won't ever be my favorite sweater though, and definitely doesn't fit the same as any of my other cold shoulder tops which are much more true to the style. I will say the green is a nice color."
"I deliver pizza and i spend a lot of time outside.  This coat would have been fine just to keep me warm, but it isn't ""stylish"", and it was too hot (pizzas get hot and i would be sweating with that thing on all day).

I decided to return it for something more stylish because i felt customers would tip me more if i looked nicer."
"Good shoe, but I hate how the flesh leather color is painted on, so the flesh color fades away to an ugly gray color."
"Super cute, but short in the sleeves."
Fabric was not at all what I expected- very thin and almost papery.  I bought brown and think that I would have preferred it in a different color. For the price I think it's not bad.
"good dress, but will stretch with time and washing, which makes the fabric thinner than I'd like, still wear it around the house, though"
"I'm 5'6"" and it wasn't as long or as wide as I wanted but it will do as needed  for what I need it for"
Fit is WAY too small.
Inside sole kept coming out after getting wet but i just pulled them out and continued on.
It is nice shoes but they made a mistake in sizing. My husband wear 10.5 EW in all shoes include Clarks. But this pairs are way too large. It is weird..
"Cute shorts, but much too small. I followed the sizing chart, I'm 5'3 and 125 ponds and usually a 4/6 dress size so I ordered these shorts in a small. They seem well made but the fabric is static-y. Waistband is not elastic, which is nice if they would have fit. Despite being small they cover my cheeks, unlike the photo shown here."
"I like it a lot!!! Just the right size for my needs. Hope it will hold up for long. As I am thinking of using it everyday. :) i just put it 3 stars because there's a scuff at the front side where the handle is. And loose/ no thread on some part. It sways when I use the crossbody strap and the other wing goes inside,while the other wing stays in place. So I would rather use it without the long strap. Overall, I like it and I love how fast the shipping is and it was packed nicely. Hope I could buy again in another color!!"
"Cute shape and styling, but seem poorly made and material is grainy, not smooth, causing them to look cheap and obviously synthetic. From far away they pass the test though. I'll wear these for a bit and then replace them when they fall apart in a year or two."
The material is much to course and heavy in today's world of microfiber. Not really what I though they would be - Thet're fine I just do not care for the heavier material.
too small for my daughter
After reading the other reviews I expected a lot worse then I received. Overall I was actually quite surprised with the quality. Although you can tell they don't come from Disney they looks and feel like Disney pins for the most part.
"I returned this piece but only b/c it's just too heavy. I have carpal tunnel & this hurt my arm when I put it on. It is beautiful however, so if you like heavy jewelry then this is a great piece to get, but if you're like me & need something light this will not work for you."
Great fabric choices and can be used for a headband or to appear like a scarf. I just need something more sporty for work
The heel on my right foot dug in so bad after an hour of wearing them I cannot wear them without bandages on the heels. I gave them 3 stars because I still think they look cute.
Grand daughter did not really like the outfit. The product was as advertised.
"Nothing great but they'll do the job. They are rather small and the workmanship does not seem that great, threats hanging but I would probably buy them again since there aren't many options."
they were much smaller than I expected -- but the quality is nice
"This garment actually looks nicer in the picture than in reality, however, it is ok with cropped pants or shorts."
"Its too thin. Not a fluffy as it looks. It seems to have nothing in between the layers to help keep you warm on a cold day. Not really worth the amount of money paid. It's looks nice, the texture is soft, amd the material is good, but it's more of a style coat on a semi chilly day then a full on winter coat."
"Definitely made for slender gals of Asian sizes. It fit my legs perfectly, but was a bit low in the crotch. Not made for a gal with a curvy bottom! I'm 5'3"" and 128 lbs of Asian descent.  Otherwise, it was super soft and cozy! It was an okay fit."
The sole of the slipper is too large while the elastic around the back of the foot is too small. I find the elastic cutting sharply into the back of my ankle. Not very comfortable for me.
Too big. Cute though! Not all Go Walks fit the same.
"This bra is true to size, and fits well, but as a larger-busted woman, the center panel slides down, making the bra much less attractive and a little less supportive over the course of the day.  It's comfortable, though.  It does have a strange strap set-up, where the straps have a sort of lever in front, but are only attached there (kind of like overalls).  It means you really need to sew the straps in place, once you figure out where you want them."
The outside strap is pretty snug on my pinky toe and if I wear them to long it rubs.
Nice sandle run a little small
"It runs very small, went off the sizing chart and ordered one according to the chart and it was still way tight and the sleeves were short. Definitely order a size or two up. Other than the sizing, it is a very nice thermal."
"These looked a bit different from what was pictured, but still nice. However, they definitely room large in the waist and are longer, so I will have to return. The shorts on the right are the same brand, same size and are what I would expect for 3T shorts."
"These shorts probably were pants in the previous life.  They're light and comfortable, but I don't care for the shiny material."
"I ordered 2 medium shirts, this one is longer than the Solid Slim Fit polo"
"I like the look and feel, but these are not warm socks! I thought they would be thick and snuggly but they aren't."
"As most have depicted about this product is is way to small and I'm a small woman, just didn't fit well and the material is really not that great. But its hard to gripe for such a low cost. I'm sure it is satisfactory to the person that is built for this type of pant."
"These sandals are extremely comfortable and fit very well.  However, the red is much brighter than shown in the photo.  I'm hoping they tone down a bit over time."
It makes a funny noise.  It sounds like there's tissue paper somewhere sewn into the fabric.
"It does look like the picture--very cute.  But the turtle seems too plastic like.  Still, I'm glad I bought but am reconsidering giving to an adult friend as a gift due to the plastic-like turtle.  I'll actually wear though :-)"
"Looks nice, but the buckles are cheap, and the plastic boning will come out after a few wears"
Good price for novility sweater.  Fit was smaller than expected.  Had to iron the decorative rain deer back on as it was falling off when received.
"too narrow, they are 5E's and to narrow"
"good material and weight, but VERY small, I bought to use as top layer but can't wear over another shirt"
"They were given as a gift. So, they served their purpose"
"This is a very unique pair of shoes.  Not a pair that can be worn with just anything.  I usually wear a 7.5 and I bought an 8 because they didn't have any 1/2 sizes.  Good thing I did because the angle of the wedge does force your feet to the front and the shoe being a little bigger helps.  I have bought a Dr. Scholls insert for mine to make them more comfortable.
I bought these because I've never seen anyone else wear anything like this.  I love them and for the price & the speed in which I received them, I am very happy with my purchase.  Depending on your tolerance, they may not be something you can wear every single day but they were well worth the purchase.  My husband isn't crazy about them but I think they're hot!
Im giving them 3 stars because the only thing I wear are heels/wedges/clogs 3.5 -5 inches and this wedge was just pushing it a little.  I think if the wedge was slightly lower they would be more comfortable.  I think they should have had more of a variety of pattern selections as well."
"They are nice, nice color, but I had to send mine back. They were too small. But they are not the last of Seychelles shoes"
"Please note: I received this item at a discounted rate or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I was really happy with these when I pulled them out of the packaging which was inside more packaging, which was inside more packaging. That's right they were individually wrapped, then wrapped in a plastic bag, then wrapped in a bigger plastic bag. It took a while to get them out. They would've made great gifts, but I would not buy them for friend now.  Within minutes of pulling these out and looking at them, it was evident that the manufacturing process has not been that great. The fabric is nice and soft, and the prints are adorable, but the sewing leave something to be desired. It looks like they were surged, and then never stood shut. How sad,  because these could've been a stellar product with a little quality control. Looks like four out of six of them have a hole in them. Yep, that's right, four out of six are defective. I'll have to hand so them, or run them through my sewing machine if I can. Still, my daughter likes them and thinks they're adorable. She wanted to wear them all at once.  The good news is, she hates headbands, but she's leaving meson just fine."
"These shoes are comfortable, but they don't fit as well as I'd hoped. I normally hike in Columbia North Plains Vented shoes, but I was travelling to a national park in a colder climate, and wanted a waterproof trail shoe that was a little warmer. This shoe is definitely warmer than the North Plains Vented, but they don't seem to fit my feet as well. This shoe is narrower across the front of the shoe, but feels wider at the heel. Both the forefoot and heel have substantial, almost bouncy cushioning; it's a little distracting while walking on a hard surface, but not as noticeable on the trail. The tread looks less aggressive than the North Plains Vented, but seems grippy enough.

September 2015 update: after several hikes of about a dozen miles each, I've worn numerous blisters on my toes and even lost a toenail with these shoes. I bought them a half-size bigger than I normally wear; they were plenty long enough, but there's just not enough room in the toe box. I wanted to like these shoes, but they just didn't work for me."
"This (I do have the coral) is my 2nd pair of shoes of FRANCO SARTO. I may say that this brand is more for slim feet. Length of shoes are always true but the width is quite narrow. Also the material (leather) is not soft at all. The work is fine, always beautiful design but not so somfortable for a long time."
you get what you pay for. I will buy again just to save a few dollars on clothes. I guess I'm cheap...
"I am a 36D but order up a band size when I'm not familiar with the company, I ordered a 38 D and the cup was too big and the band was just right. I am only giving 3 stars as I can not comment on the quality or longevity of this bra and if my boobs did in fact fill the cups, they would still look funny, the girls were too far away from each other."
"Before this wallet, I was using another small wallet/card holder.  I have been slowly destroying it though, so I'm constantly looking for the newer, better version.  This is not it, and I'm back to my old wallet.

Pros:
This wallet holds a surprising amount of cash.  Like, a hundred dollars in small bills, easy.
The magnet is strong, I feel comfortable with it in my pocket with at least 10 bills in it.
The extra pockets are great for storing extra cash

Cons
Not enough card space
Color rubs off when damp (but only for a little while, and I got this box in a downpour)

Those two cons are enough to knock this down to two or three stars in my book.  With my several hundred dollars of cash in place (some in the money clip and some in the pocket behind it), I put my handful of business card sized things in the side pocket, my main card in the outside slot, my id in the top slot, and then tried to put my other four cards in the middle slot... and they did not fit.  I tried some other variations, but I just couldn't make it work in a usable way.

Overall, if you are paring down your wallet for the first time, this may be a good fit for you, but as someone who uses everything in my already small (smaller than this one), this wasn't good for that for me.

I was lucky enough to be given the awesome opportunity to purchase this item with a discount on this product in order to provide an honest and unbiased review of the product, in my own words with only how I feel about it, not an inflated review. As such, I do tend to write reviews as honestly as I can, but I also know that because I was able to receive the product at a discount that may bias my opinion of the product, so I try to imagine that I had had to pay full price for the product, rather than a smaller amount, so basically imagine that I did not get a discount, and base my review off of that. I am hopeful that that helps with the bias and makes my review a more accurate tool for judging the worth of the product, rather than just something that people gloss over and ignore because of the ""I got a discount"" disclaimer at the bottom of the review. As a final addition to this disclaimer, I try to base the length of the review solely off what I feel needs to be said about the product, so some reviews will be quite lengthy and wordy (kind of like this disclaimer), while others will be short, sweet, and to the point (like when the product just straight up works or is just awful - there's only so many ways to say that)."
"Overall first impression was blah. The look was ok but slightly clunky not that looks really matter for running shoes. The construction overall appeared we'll put together, but they had cheap laces. The fell was nice with regards to internal seams or bumps (you can't feel them) and they have plenty of cushion for a zero drop shoe, but the fit a half size small from asics, or saucony.  The top is very flexible and left me feeling slightly unstable in the forefoot. I returned them for this reason and being slightly too small.  I did not buy a bigger pair."
it is good and fits a lot. but i didn't find keys for the bag
"Visually, the shoes are adorable and they are lightweight to walk in despite their bulky look.

 I wear an 8.5 generally, and ordered a pair of these in 9 and when they arrived my toes were jammed up in the front of the shoe, so I returned them for a 10. The 10s fit better, but when I walk I still feel the tips of my big toes pressing against the front of the shoe. Also, though I apparently needed the 10 for length, the roominess for the rest of my foot requires me to tie the shoes uncomfortably tightly so my ankle doesn't slide around and cause blisters or tripping as I try to walk."
"Very cute, but the hat fits a bit snug."
Doesn't lie very nicely on the wrist. I may make some adjustments of my own. Pendant needs to be attached in more than one spot in order for it to lie correctly.
"This is a well made bolero but the sizing is smaller than expected. I ordered a medium, which according to the chart will fit women's size 8-10 but I couldn't put it on. I am 5'3"" and 125 pounds, and this size will normally fit me, but not this one. Other than that, it's really striking and if I had had more time, I would have exchanged it. It's very well made. I just had a struggle with the size."
"Very narrow opening. My granddaughter has a high arch and she could not get this shoe on.  It was a lovely shoe, but had to give to
her cousin.  Kind of expensive for just a plain flip flop"
"I chose this watch because of the low price and that the battery was supposed to last a long time.  Somewhat disconcerting that the watch was already running when I opened the box.  How long has it been running?  How much battery life did I get for the price?  Only time will tell.  If it causes me this much concern, perhaps it's not such a deal after all."
"If you are pear shaped, skip these jeans."
"Not quite as advertised, shiny silver with no antiquing.  Looks cheaper than the price."
"decent for the price, bigger than expected even for ""oversized."" just doesnt hold well over my nose but maybe thats my own problem."
needs comfortable insets
"Length is fine, however the width of the leather top is large (I have narrow feet) which caused my heels to side to the exterior side and off the sandal.  I remedied this by putting callus cushions inside the leather tops above the arches. The sandals are very comfortable. The second time I wore them I was on my feet almost continuously for 12 hours.  This is the first time I have purchased shoes online.  May not do it again."
I normally wear a 7 1/2 shoe and 7-8 in sandals (they usually run in whole sizes). The colors are beautiful and like the picture. The 8 fits perfectly until the material over the top stretches a bit. That happens quickly. I would recommend them:)
"The style of the shoe was beautiful,  however the sole was extremely hard and inflexible.  The gold was much darker than anticipated, it looked more like brown/bronze.  I hated to return the shoe because it looked classy, but casual. I found it difficult to walk in because of the stiffness of the sole."
I like the shoes. Its a great shoe for outside wear when you want to look nice...I wear them to work too!
Fits wide.
These were really comfortable at first but for some reason they have started to cause bruising across the top of my foot on one side near the laces. I have worn them about 5 times and only once two days in a row which is when I noticed the pain and bruising.
"I thought I was getting flannel--didn't real the description very well.  It is much too large, but as I needed it right away, I just shortened the legs and the arms.  I sort of feel like a clown in it because of the bright colors."
Wore underneath my wedding dress. For all other dresses it's far too bulky and lumpy. Even with a slip
Way too narrow!
"I bought two large shirts and they just fit.  One was slightly larger than the other.  I wear a medium normally.  However, I washed both of them and they did not shrink.  They seem well made and I will keep them to wear over another top."
"Good material, too big for me."
Bought this as a school uniform for my 15 year old daughter. It is a little small. My daughter is almost always a medium and sometimes a small. Luckily it does fit my 12 year old daughter
I wish the straps has velvet or something underneath to prevent blisters.
"The sneaker looked great, it just wasn't wide enough. The gel pad inside takes more room than I expected."
Runns small but still a nice shirt.
"This is a review of Rituals The Ritual of Hammam Body Cream.

It always bothers me when a high priced product to begin with is packaged in a container that give a completely false impression of how much product you are actually getting. When you take this out of the box your initial impression is, ""wow, this is a huge container of body cream."" But you quickly realize that the weight doesn't jive with the size of the conatiner and when you look carefully you can see that it is a nested container that holds far less body cream than the outer container would suggest.

Now that I've got that off my chest ...

This has a very strong initial scent that I don't care for. It does subside after a while and although the cream is quite effective, I am so put off by the scent that I just can't use this. It does seem to be quite rich and moisturizes well. If you can handle the scent you may like it more than I do."
I ordered a small and it's much too large!  I'm 110 lbs. and the small is way too big.  It's a pretty top though!
"That said, these are nice and comfortable and I like the colors!  Though I may not order this style again but I like the brand, FOTL."
My husband'd favorite jeans. He has been wearing the same brand jeans 34 X 34 so we ordered another one but the new one we received seem to be a 32 X 34 but labeled 34 X 34. We decided to keep it since he is going to diet.
These were huge on my eyes! I was hoping to be able to wear them almost everyday. They are meant more for halloween purposes but thats ok! I'll use them eventually.
The watch is the great casio product no complaints about that. Very happy. But I do have a problem with the color. It is not purple. The band is a light blue. It should not have purple as a color.
"I have thin fine hair and I keep it highlighted to help with thickness and volume. I was excited to try this with the promise of plumping up my hair and giving it body and volume. Here comes in a small metal can with a spray pump and easily sprays a fine mist.

The results: Well, it's not quite the miracle I was expecting but it gets kudos for not irritating my very sensitive scalp. Most of the time when I try something new I spray it on and then within 10 minutes start itching but it did not happen with this spray. I've done this both with wet and dry hair. It's heat activated so I spray the roots of the crown of my head, flip my head upside down and dry with a blow dryer and then finish right side up using a metal round brush. I think maybe I noticed a slight difference... maybe. I'm not going to say that I'm positive because there wasn't enough difference for me to not turn around and use my normal product.

When I follow it up with a inexpensive leading company's dry shampoo then I achieve the results that I wanted. The volume and thicker hair. I would say PHYTO PHYTOVOLUME in conjunction with it is a good combination. It may just not get the results for me but you may get the results for yourself because a lot of people love this product. I do like volumizing shampoo but I don't know that I would order this product again."
"I thought it would be a more Mint green but it turned out to be a Xmas green, fits perfect tho."
"I ordered these in a Large which says 36-38 on the actual tag, not just the generic Amazon description so this is the manufacturers actual claim. Lengthwise, these fit perfectly (I am 6'0"" for what it's worth), so no issues there. But I would consider this a smidgen tight for a 36. There's simply no way that these would qualify as a size 38. I tend to wear a size 38 in jeans because they inevitably shrink, but I always need a belt to keep them from falling off. However, if I was a true 38, these Fruit of the Loom Jersey Knit Sleep Pants would not fit. Part of me wishes I ordered the XL, but I'd imagine those would probably be too long in length. Considering I paid $6.88 for these, I don't consider it a bad deal. I just hope it doesn't shrink any further in the wash. However, I now see they've increased the price to $14.99 and these are definitely not worth THAT. You can get the knit pants made by the brand that starts with ""H"" on Amazon for $10 right now. I own a pair of those as well and find them to be a better fit around the waste. If you're on the larger side of 36-38 you'll be better off with those. However, if you're 6'2"" or taller, perhaps these in the XL would fit you, assuming the price returns to under $7, which is about as much as I would pay for these."
"Doesn' t fit, waist bigger than expected. Looks great, can't wait to be able to actually wear it."
good garment but a little short. i was expecting a little bit long.
Good looking but a narrow styling means they're best for at most 1/3-1/2 day at a time for my husband (gym owner) who is in the gym for 6 or more hours daily and has 2-3 pair of athletic shoes in rotation at a time. Next time we'll go for a wide width or just stick with other brands.
"Would be suitable if it was something we wanted, but it was too much the pirate when we wanted the more formal ruffle shirt."
"The upside is that it is pretty.
I find the lace a bit irritating against my skin. I tried it on over a thin shirt and where the bra hit my arms it irritated. I cannot wear it. In the few minutes I had it on it also rides up. Underneath a shirt the seams on the cups are visible, I don't like that. If I could tolerate the sensation, I would keep it because it is very pretty."
Hair was too thin and tangled easily.
"The strap on the left side broke as soon as I put it on, I'm not big in the arms and by no means should this have happened.  My only complaint is the strap breaking because this dress is beyond gorgeous!"
I read other reviews saying this was hard to put on and probably would take two people.. I ignored it and laughed.. I received this item and it's very pretty.. but SERIOUSLY hard to put on and i'm use to wearing corsets.. on the front trying to get the hooks buttoned as soon as you get one done another one comes undone.. it usually takes me 10 minutes just to get it on!!! ..
"While some reviews noted that the calf was wide and the description shows they measure 16"" this is the not the case. My calves are 15"" without socks or pants and the boots were tight, leaving a mark on my leg. They fit very tightly, perhaps they stretch out or to the 16"" size but they fit very tightly. Boots overall look well made but I couldn't wear them with jeans tucked in so I had to return them."
"Well made, nice looking and comfortable but had to return. The shaft of the boot was not as tall as I expected and too wide at the top for me...."
"bought it by accident, thinking it was the facial cream/sunscreen."
The flip flops are comfortable and fit as expected. Deducting 2 stars since they were emitting and the whole room stunk of chemicals when I opened the package. I had to soak it in soap and water for an hour and dry it in the sun to get rid of the fumes/smell.
"The elastic straps were way too tight on my 4-yr-old, and she could not put these shoes on. So I cut the straps off, and now she can get shoes on by herself and runs around in them all day."
"Very comfy but a little too small, I typically wear an xl in pajama pant like this but these are a little small, I think they would be great pajamas if were  a little bigger"
"A very nice jeans, but a bit tighter than expected,not so bad and the color is very beautiful but it is somewhat tight"
The shoe itself is built durable but uncomfortable on long runs. I run between 25-35 miles a week and my Achilles' tendon is starting to hurt. I've had these shoes for about 3 months and the seem to hold up to the abuse. I run on trails that are snow and dirt covered. As well as pavement and gravel
"Great sandal, but why the ridiculous hard blue sole that weirdly doesn't match the rest of the shoe??"
A little ugly for the wear. But it's a scrub so I don't care to much. It's a good price and came quickly.
"I loved these while I had them. I wore them for a few weeks, but the clasps were too weak and I lost one who knows where..so now the one is useless."
"The first thing you notice about this device is the quality of the construction. The wood is high grade, the metal screw heavy gauge, reasonable leverage on the shoe. To work this device you simply screw it down to fit in the shoe. Depending on whether your attempting to widen or lengthen you twist 1) the handle will expand the front toe 2) the upper collar screw will expand the length. You can not do both at the same time. You either widen or lengthen. On either operation the device has very broad capability. The problem is your shoe has to cooperate. On a regular womens shoe I would look for more than half a size. It the leather is pliable maybe a little more. You can buy a bottle of leather stretcher spray (water and alcohol) or steam the tight section over a kettle (my preferred method). Over time (hours) you can slowly and very incrementally re-tighten to get the shoe bigger. The only two warnings I would give is 1) there is no way to know how large your making the shoe 2) the handle allows you to over torque the screw producing crunching sounds which I think means your breaking it."
Too narrow in the footbox. Shoes have gone that way in recent yeara though. Had to return and buy a 4e width shoe.
"I was a bit shocked at how small the waist is on these. My son is really skinny, so he thinks they would fit. I was afraid to put in the dryer!!! So I air dried them. They are well made as all Carharrt items. he doesnt like the thermals that are wicked material. I hope he wears them for what these cost! Whew! I wouldn't buy again."
"Like the FitFlop slip-on shoes that I purchased for wife earlier, this looked nice and well made, but even though the same size (and the size she normally wears), these came nowhere close to fitting, would not go on at all in fact. Even though they apparently run small, you will get stuck with the return postage fee (even if Amazon Prime member) since you failed to foresee the disparity in the fit. Given that the previous pair in the same size fit and worked great, I'm not sure that I understand how that is buyer fault, but certainly points out the risks in non in-person purchases for items requiring correct fit given the non-standard possibilities in different shaped variations of the same basic footwear."
"It was nice, but made cheap. The center bow came apart from the suit."
I  need a woman's size 14.  The color was great!
This ring is ok.  The color is pretty - but it is deceiving on how it looks.  I'll wear it for a while to see if I will keep it.
"I have 7-7.5 wide feet. My pinky toe generally gets irritated by poorly constructed shoes, but these don't hurt my feet. I've used them for about 4-5, after I exclude the winter when I used boots instead. The tongue part has developed a rip, one that won't look nice even when I patch it. I wanted these to last. :( Maybe these are better for people who like to cycle through different clothes every season, but I like buying good pieces and having them work for me for years."
"I'm returning this and getting one size bigger. Love how it looks online but it did not look like that on me. I usually wear a small but trying a medium. The small is much too short to be a dress (I'm 5'4"") but looked ok as a longer top with jeans. Hoping the medium will be flattering and long enough to be worn as intended. Quality seemed fine and will be a good deal for the price if the medium fits."
"I liked the Lewis N. Clark umbrella I lost previous to buying this one better despite it being half the price. This one does feel like it would be harder to completely break in a strong wind, but that is the only pro. The double canopy seems like it only adds maybe 20% more resilience, while the umbrella is three times as heavy as the Lewis N. Clark. I imagine a double canopy is more helpful for a large umbrella, but for an umbrella this size, I don't think it makes much sense. The description states ""Our innovative frame systems are made out of premium fiberglass and stainless steel, ensuring no rust and no breaking!"" yet mine has already developed some light rust on the joints, the parts of an umbrella which are most likely to break, which are steel, just like any other umbrella. The umbrella actually turns inside-out much EASIER than the Lewis N. Clark, however, it does seem like it could withstand that any number of times unlike the Lewis N. Clark. Also, a small amount of water is forced through / splattered off of the fabric of the umbrella in heavy rain, which I have never experienced with another umbrella. Finally, the handle feels wobbly due to the way the shaft is constructed, such that it is hard to quickly feel changes in the wind in order to adjust the angle you're holding it at. But if you live in an area with slower wind, or have a more oblivious style of umbrella carrying, and just want something that is unlikely to completely break in a freak gust, and don't care that it weighs three times as much and costs twice as much and will rust just as quickly, this may be a good choice for you."
They were marked 2x but fit more like XL. Unfortunately I have washed them so I don't know if they were originally too small or if they shrank. I would hope they weren't meant to shrink that much so I am assuming that they were too small to begin with. It's a good thing I am losing weight I will soon be able to wear them (next winter).
"It was made much better than I had expected. It's slightly bigger than I had expected, I had ordered a large and I am a curvy 8 or 10 in women's, I didn't even have to unzip it to get it on or off.  But it still seems to fit fine, it could be a little tighter though. My one real complaint is it smelled horrible! Like it was stored some place that was flooded and but the dress itself didn't get wet so it had a dank and moldy smell with no damage. I washed it first with woolite on a hand wash setting because I didn't want it to tear up, that didn't work, so next on the same setting with Tide instead, it did help, but it's still a lingering slight smell. I smelled it originally as soon as i opened it."
"This one's a bit strange, and I struggle a bit to find the best way to describe the way this bra fits.  One reviewer complained that it's got a pointy look.  That's true, but it's not just that the cups are ""pointy"" but they're shaped... differently.  The fullest part of the cup is really far out to the sides.  We're not talking /\/\, more like |\_/|.  Everything has to be pushed out toward the sides to fit.  With a substantial almost-in-the-armpit underwire, the wire is pushing things in, fighting the cup shape.  If you've got a relatively outward facing and narrow breast root, this might be a good shape for you.  I found it to have a strange minimizing yet gaping in places fit overall.  The straps are not easy to adjust (this is a good thing, as a strap that loosens up during wear is annoying), and the entire strap can be adjusted.  I've had some bras I wanted to tighten the straps up on just a bit more than the make allowed, but that's not an issue here.  As far as hiding bulges, it doesn't unfortunately do anything about bulge just under the bra (until there's less of me to love, I just get to deal with that), but is relatively smooth otherwise on the back.  The way the bra comes up high under the arm makes for some bulging in front by the armpit after moving your arms a bit, which is annoying, but it's not super obvious.  I ordered in two different cup sizes, and the issues were far more pronounced in the larger cup size (technically the correct size for me) and less in the smaller size, which smooshed things enough to fill it out a bit unnaturally.  I wouldn't wear this bra under nice clothes, as it doesn't flatter... at all."
"Very very thin material - loved the style, cut, color but too thin. I am recovering from a double mastectomy and I'm very picky on what shows through"
"I usually wear Clarks  9 C/D (W), but really liked this shoe, so I bought an Aerosoles for the first time. The 9W was tight around the midfoot, and I felt the seam wear the leather meets the sole - so the sole wasn't wide enough.  It didn't feel like there was much padding, either."
"The reason I purchased this ring over any other claddaugh ring on Amazon was because the crown above the heart stuck out less and was more subtle. However, when I received the item I found that it was different from the photo and the crown sticks out more than I like. Not a huge problem but it was the only reason I purchased this ring rather than one from a competitor"
"Ordered this item and it arrived 07-23-2013.  There were a lot of comments about these wallets having sticky glue on the inside upon opening after arrival.  This happened to me too.  Order two of them and one was full of residual glue and the other did not have it.  Send the one with sticky glue back and kept the other.  The design of the wallet is good.  Credit cards and licenses fit very well and sewing quality appears better than average.  Mine was not the leather version, so the verdict is still out on how long this wallet will last.  Perhaps will post an update later."
"I ordered red and blue, but they look almost peach colored. I usually wear a women's 7.5 - 8. Ordered an 8 and my toes are basically off the end, but I needed them for my sons swim classes so didn't bother to return. I should have ordered an 8.5-9 probably."
"Great little umbrella, only 3 stars bc it smelled terrible when it arrived, maybe moth balls? I rinsed it off but it still smells."
"Its okay at best but, definitly mass produced with the actual figure blurred out as in a double stamped penny..Should be more of a $25.00 item or range."
"I am a big fan of Wallflowers jeans and this particular style is my favorite.  They are not premium quality but they look like it, and they wear and wash very well.  For the price they're excellent.  However, I am displeased with this particular item listing.  I have several pairs of Wallflowers in various denim colors, however they're ALL the same super dark denim.  Exactly the same.  This pair appears to be a much lighter blue than my others, but it is not.  It is absolutely identical to my Luscious Curvy skinnies that are ""Freshman Tint"" color (ultra dark).  I was half-expecting this, after all of my other Wallflower orders wound up being the same color...and yep, super dark and nothing like what is pictured.  Aside from the color however, they are fantastic and the style IS as pictured and the fit is great.  I can't bring myself to give my usual 4-5 star review for Wallflowers because they basically look nothing like the photo color-wise and if you're like me and hoping to add variety with a second pair of jeans that you already have in dark dark denim, you'll be disappointed.  Otherwise go for it, they're great!"
Love this but of course it's cheap and sheds like crazy...if you don't mind pink hair everywhere! I recommend it
"Surprisingly decent for cheap shoes. Breaking them in was a little painful and the stitching on the right shoe is imperfect because it doesn't seem to fit my foot right, even though the left shoe fits perfectly. But I'm still pretty happy with them for the price, I was honestly expecting worse."
Even though these are the same brand of jeans they fit bigger than the straight cut. So order a size smaller if you are like me - I found that in the waist they were larger than the straight cut - so they don't fit as well. Otherwise they are fine.
"the bra, the delivery were fine, but the bra has a huge grease mark on it.  I wasn't going to go to all the trouble to send it back, it fits so I'm keeping it, but I""m not happy about the grease mark."
The hair was a bit wilder than expected and the rubber bands were really cheap. But it served its purpose.
"Need to be hand washed or gentle, they are not very durable. Top band tends to come unraveled."
Order a size larger than your normal. It is good quality.
"These were OK but the chain was cheap-looking... I considered for my bridesmaids, but decided against them. See photos."
"Perfect fit

Nice material which protects from the sun
fitted very well.
met my wife's requirements
easy wash and good for travel"
I love the packaging for Euphoria.  Its in a space age type bottle and the contents are lavender.  The bottle is indented on both sides providing a handy place for your thumbs to hold on to.  I often get serious headaches from scents but that was not the case with Euphoria.  I cant say I love the overly sweet smell however.  Its not overpowering but even a little spritz lasts a long time.
"I bought these to try for a renaissance fair.
There is nothing to go between toes, and that first thing of plastic is large enough that I could slide very very far forward in the shoe. I tried various tie methods. All were leaving marks because I had to tie it tight enough that things did not move. I tried going up the calves, and I tried just around the ankle. They are alright, but I could not get it situated in a way that did not shift or move while walking."
"I have a small waist and bigger hips (about a 6 in. difference), so I had to go with the mediums, and I have to cinch the drawstring almost all the way to get them to stay up. I would have returned if it wasn't past the 30 day window."
As pictured but tooooooo little...omg
I only wore this once because it was somewhat small to begin with and then it shrunk some more after washing. I could probably wear it again if I wore leggings underneath to compensate for the length shrinkage.
"Received on time, nothing was wrong with the shirt - just didn't look good on me."
Nice pants but fit was small.
Color is bit more dull than in the picture but the Fit is perfect and the material is very comfy.
"LIKE A SECOND SKIN, SO DONT GET UNLESS YOU ARE COMFORTABLE POSING FOR WALMART PICS"
These are not as soft and comfy as other Toms shoes. Even adding half a size the instep is still tight. Pretty but not for all-day
"Belt quality is good.  However, I had to return it because it had a strong odor of mold & mildew."
Front strap comes way too tight which squeezes your toes and makes the walk uncomfortable. Not good for walking all day.
"I like it, but too narrow.."
a bit too pointy toed
It does work good for safety.. but its a little uncomfortable when you use it for work... wide and big... look for smaller sizes.
"This is a great jewelry organizer.  However, the magnets do not work. I have to lock the door to keep it close....quite annoying. Also overpriced."
mmm no as i expected
Tight across toes. Seems the decorative strap reduces the stretch and flexibility.
"Sent back. Cute shoe, but no half size. I ordered down rather than up which was a mistake."
"Bought one for me & one for my husband. The pin that holds the watch to the band had fallen off twice, easy fix but.....
My husbands was not running when we got it, needs a battery.
Brand new watch thatneeds a battery?? Are you kdding?"
"I was very excited to give this to my husband. I regret it and wish I'd just gotten him a smart watch. He has had problems with the buttons sticking, the compass calibration, batteries dying and in general it just seems like it works to tell time. I have not contacted Suunto or the seller but for the price I'm simply disappointed."
"These are nice pajamas, but definitely run small. My 5 month old son barely fits into the 6-9 month size."
"When I purchased this bag, I was looking for a higher quality cinch bag to use for those days where I need to carry some things with me for my kids, but don't really want to lug around a book bag to carry it all.  I will say, this is a high quality bag and appears as though it will last for quite a while.  What I don't like is there is no compartments of any kind INSIDE the bag.  I like the compartment on the outside, but I would have preferred an additional one on the inside where I could put my wallet, keys, etc., without concern of someone easily unzipping the front and taking something out.  My other complaint is I do not like the straps at all.  I could be doing something very wrong, which is likely, but I'd much prefer just a single strap.  The two seem to be uneven in length and one strap on each side is constantly slipping off my shoulder.  I ended up just carrying the bag on one shoulder to avoid that.  I'll continue to use the bag, but will likely keep looking for one that meets my needs."
"Nice appearance, but too narrow. And my son has a fairly narrow foot:/"
"I wear a size 31-32 so purchased a medium and it is a lot more roomier than I'd expect it to be.  Also it is roomy in the legs, which I didn't expect as the photos for the item do not look baggy.  I don't believe going a size smaller would remedy that problem.  Anyway if you do buy this, I'd go a size smaller than what the size chart might indicate.  It's not very thick so be aware of that if you're looking for sweats that are thick and warm.  This isn't a criticism since you may want thinner sweats, just be mindful of that."
"Very comfy, but the size 7 seems size 7.5 or 8.  Fits my daughter, she size 8.  So I gave it to her.  She loves it."
The jacket is nice and cute. However it does leave lent on your clothes. It is not lined and depending on what your wearing it can leave unsightly lent all over. Especially if you are wearing white.
The larges was too small and theses were too big. The sizing could definitely use some work. Quality is good. Has belt loops that helps with the sizing.
The quality was very good. However I had to return it because it was too small. I wear a 3X in all my other clothing but I could not get this past my hips.
"They are okay but just okay.  The cut is different than other underwear I have, including from Champion, in that they are a little short in the back and don't feel like they are pulled all the way up.  After I get them on and got used to them they are fine but I won't be buying this specific version again."
The Band pitch in your arm when you're wearing it no watch and hold its ok
A little small but cute af
"The shoe itself is nice quality, the velcro wore out in two weeks.  The shoe now slips off my daughters foot all the time while she walks. We are constantly putting the shoe back on. This has become her chore shoe. Sad to say, we won't be buying another pair when she outgrows this one."
as you can imagine the mechanism will be broken in not more tan 2 months
I notice Lilyette bra is larger than the other brands. I'm a 36C\36D but this was too big so I'm going to reorder for the 36C .
Not too find of the pattern but the quality is spot on. It does run a size large.
No shape to the ankles.  They go straight to the toe.  I don't like the look of the empty ankles on my skinny kid.  Too bad.  The rest of them seems fine.  They feel really nice out of the package.  But I do wonder how much they would pill.  Cable tights might camouflage that better.
Its just ok. You get what you paid for. Looks. Cheap. Ok to wear around the house. Run errands but not to wear out.
I wish the cuffs were tighter
It's not the softest but it works well..and the color a very nice
"I've been wearing swim dresses since I had my second child a year and a half ago. In the last couple of months I have lost a decent about of weight and I felt like I was ready for a two piece bathing suit again. I have a bikini that I got last summer that aaalllllmost fits and looks decent but I figured I needed something with a bit more coverage. I liked the idea of this being high wasted and the top being a little lower. Well, the top is great. The cups are shaped, awesome to not have to worry about those stupid little inserts that always bunch up in the wash. The top is a pullover, I wish it was more adjustable because it seems as soon as I drop any more weight it won't fit.
The bottoms are pretty bad. The chevron design is less than flattering and the cut makes my already wide hips look even wider. Everything fits ok except for the leg holes. They're super tight, I can't imagine it being comfortable until I lose enough weight that they don't fit at all anymore. I was excited about this one but I think it will be donated before long.
I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"I wear a size 6, but my toe is at the tip of these shoes.  Other than that, they are just fine."
"It's a decent skirt, but it does wrinkle pretty easily and came wrinkled. It's lighter than I expected, so perfect for summer and ok for the winter over boots and tights. I'm fairly short, so it hits me slightly higher than mid-calf, which is great since a lot of skirts these days are too short for work. I got it at a great price, so I didn't feel the need to return it. Had it been full price, I would probably consider returning just because the waist area is larger than I expected (I have a 26 inch waist and it sits lower)."
"Too wide at the front of the shoes, the toes move forward and hit the front end of the shoes during walking. Returned."
The socks were thinner than I expected.
needs to be wider
"Great boot!

I love the color and the fit from the ankle to the shin was perfectly snug.

My toes had enough room to wiggle but my heels were slipping and sliding in the back. I had to get a heel insert for the boot to fill in the space in the heel part.

I have a hard time finding boots that have the exact fit for my feet... if I had the money, I would shell out for some custom ones."
Fit is shorter than pictured.
Have not had a chance to wear for any length of time. But fit well. no real base... appear they will be just fine for walking the beach on the way to a snorkel.
The size is to small. The bra is on the small size and panties are to small for size large.
pads in shoes wore out and separated after a month.
Button closures for pants pockets are difficult to open and to align for closure
Cute. Has a stretch but way too short. I will be returning this dress asap.
The swimsuit is beautiful !! I am a little top heavy so my breast could have used a size larger but it's fine other that the small top
Your basic ball chain. Shiny but I wonder how it will hold up over time.
Sent them back because they were to large.
"I really wanted to love this shirt; the material is soft, the color a nice, bold black, the fit s true to size, all great!  Unfortunately, the material is thin enough that it is sheer, which means needing to add an additional layer to what I was hoping would be my base layer.

If you're looking for a soft, comfy shirt to be your outer layer, and don't mind the sheer aspect, I say go one size up and enjoy!"
"Cute and warm pants but unless you wear the pants very high, the crotch area sags down."
Just a little too thin for my liking shows every curve
The under band rolls for some reason and becomes more uncomfortable then an underwire would be normally. Otherwise it fits well and is comfortable until it rolls.
"This bathing suit is sized differently than many of the other inexpensive bathing suits on here! I purchased a size L because I had read to size up. I am about 5'5"" and 145 lbs. I typically wear a medium on both the top and bottom.
The size L bottoms are very snug. Typical of a smallish-medium size. The top is as expected for a size large, but as my chest fits a size medium it was far too large for me. These reasons are why I will not post any pictures of the product (as they would be inappropriate). Another issue with this suit is that it comes with circular padding  not triangular or molded to a natural breast shape. I switched the padding out with old pads from another swimsuit for a more natural look. Or, if the top is snug enough, you could take out the padding entirely (as I often do with properly-fitting tops) for more comfort.
However, the quality of the material is decent, and the fabric is just as bright as in the picture. The pattern on the top is really cute with vibrant colors. The stitching is done well, and it doesn't seem to have any glaring issues. The bottoms are also a vibrant blue that would really compliment any skin tone.
If you are top-heavy, or just chesty (well-endowed), this suit would be great for you. If you have a larger rear end, you won't be able to fit in the bottoms!
I have donated the top (as I am unable to wear it) but will be keeping the bottoms as they would make good activewear bikini bottoms that won't fall off.
I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
The shoe after worn fits large.  There is very little cushion on the foot bed.  I will have to buy inserts to give them more cushion and fit a bit more snug.
A bit thin but I guess they'll do the job.
Not great for showing off curves if that's what you're going for but very soft! This shirt would actually be great for pregnancy because it's loose at the belly.
Not the best Clarks!  Uncomfortable after wearing for a few hours...seem a little short.  Glad they were low priced!
Very cute. I'm not so sure about the little Pom Poms on it but very easy to cut off if I decide I don't like them. Just a tad too large but not so much that it will look silly.
"I have this fan, which I purchaes through Amazon, in 'black'. The side that is finished is beautiful and quite detailed but the reverse side is flat, dull black...no decor at all."
"I ordered this sports bra because I was looking for something versatile to wear under my assortment of different cut and straps of tank tops. I wanted something that would look good with any tank top without having my ""lingerie"" on display or having to buy a different bra with every different cut tank top. I also choose this bra because I have a small bust and wanted something that will give me a push and padding. I ordered a medium after reading the reviews stating that it was somewhat small and to order up a size, but wished I would have ordered a small instead because it has stretched out and is two big after only wearing it twice. I also noticed a hole in the inside front of the material already. The material is very comfortable though. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a little lift in a sports bra that is also comfortable just be careful to inspect it thoroughly for holes or rips in the material before wearing. Due to the fact that it has stretched and is bigger now, it does not push up in anyway for me.

My stats-
34 yrs old
130 lbs
34 B bust ( that needs a lift and help for fullness due to nursing my children)"
The color and pattern of it was spot on but the chest area is too big and there was a tear in the bathing suit when I got it so I'll have to sew it but nice bathing suit overall
Runs a little small. But liked the style
"We got excited about how nice the shirt fit and looked until we laundered it, comes out of the dryer very very wrinkled"
i used it as a carry on and my niece borrowed it and it actually survived the air port terminal
Material warps too easily.
I usually wear medium but it i had to buy a small for the medium was to large  for me.
not bad .
"I thought the hat would be thicker, but it does a decent job of keeping my head warm enough.  Since the material is thin (can see through it if you hold it up to the light), it doesn't block much cold air.  But, it is soft and the color is sharp lookin'."
they seem comfy and colorful yet we got holes in them within the first week
Terrible fit if you have curves. Nice weight fabric and decent workmanship.  Nice length. Did not keep. Forgot to return so I gave away.
It doesn't fit well into high heel shoes.  I think it's meant for men's shoes and women's flats.
Beware of sizing.  XL is more Like a large so size up
"These things provide some non-slip quality on some floors, but they don't do much on certain surfaces like smooth tile or Terrazzo. They also don't stick too well--tend to come off after a while.  I glued them on one pair of shoes, and it worked better."
"Ah, I should've waited till I'd gotten a reply to my question about size ... cuz the gal who answered my question said she was MY size, and she found the MEDIUM fit fine. Well, I erred on the larger size and got a LARGE. It arrived today and I can see that the waist is a good inch or more too big. I'll still keep these, but they are not perfect. I find that even tho the large is slightly too big on me, the material DOES indeed stretch out over my legs and look kind of ""white-ish"" - not as dense in color as the picture of these leggings shown. Oh well, they are reasonably comfortable, but again, the waist is a bit too big, the length a tad too short, and the material a smidgeon too ""see-through"". Would I buy them in another size? Probably not."
"They were a bit too big. My daughter wears a 8.5 -9 in street shoes. And a 7 in ballet shoes. I went with the majority of the review comments that said they ran small. They don't seem high quality, but it would be hard to tell since we did not use them. I had her wear them for her dance pictures and donated them."
"I wear a 7 woman's shoe , brought this item in 7 1/2 they are too short. Runs very small, but very, very cute."
"First off, I purchased these for my boyfriend as a gift. His request was ""ridiculous slippers."" When opening them, I immediately realized that when ordering them, I hadn't recognized how large they were. They are HUGE. Almost as wide as they are long. I don't know if he has trouble walking in them or not, but then again he wears them lounging around the house.

The second thing I noticed was the foam when stepping in them. It was a very thin layer of foam, and I could feel the hardness of the floor through them, which I was disappointed in.

Overall these are cute and warm slippers, but they are large and due to their thin padding, I would not recommend them if you actually plan in walking much in them."
little on the small size.
"These look nice, but fairly big gaps on the sides of the foot.  Maybe I got them too large?  Others said they ran small so I ordered a half size up which is plenty big."
"I bought these boots for my granddaughter. She liked them but she said they were a little heavy which they are. They style is really nice and they fit good. The only thing is the weight of the boots.
Thank you,
M.L."
"I bought this to wear under seethrough skirts and shirts, and it works terrific for that purpose! It does slip up like 4in when I sit or climb stairs but the body curves keep it in good place, so it's not like it slips and everyone can see everything! But I do go to the bathroom to pull it back down every couple of hours just in case. I wear it with the straps so I don't know if it slips down from the bust. If you're looking for a corset-type effect this is not the thing for you. While it's very tight and form-fitting and keeps everything in place, it doesn't really shrink the stomach. The fabric is really good, but if you want a tummy tucker you probably need something with vertical wires around the waist.
Side note, it has 3 hooks in the back for closing, and it is quite a struggle to hook it yourself, so get help, or skill."
have worn a 12 for 30 years. These were to small in 12.
A bit short in the crotch and the pockets too shallow but otherwise a good fit. I don't dare put them in the drier or they won't fit.
"These shoes are narrow at the toes. Tried shoe stretchers, but still snug. Aside from that they're generally good looking casual loafers."
Gave as a tiny gift to a lady who plays the piano;  she enjoyed the thought and it does fit.
"It is very sheer and I will have to wear white undershirt and garments. I am wearing it for my sub-krewe outfit and will be marching when it is cold, it is fine for me. But beware, it is VERY sheer."
"I really like the robe. I love that it has a hood on it so when I wash my hair I won't freeze to death waiting for it to dry in the winter. However, I'm not much of a robe person so this stayed on the hook a lot."
"Somewhat small but they will do. I prefer the Jockey hit cut briefs in the same size that fit better, but for some reason they can't be shipped to Mexico."
They look cute but irritate my ears after long period of use
"As usual these are good quality shoes that have been made to fit exactly as described...except for one thing. The fit of the shoe around my heel was too low. The shoes feel as if they are always going to slip off unexpectedly. I know they are a slip on design, but lowering the fit at the back of the shoe didn't really aid in getting my foot into the shoe, it just didn't allow the shoe to grip my heel properly for a secure fit.
As a short trip, backyard, or just a casual visit to friends shoe, these are fine shoes. But definitely not for any distance walking like hiking through some of those modern shopping malls for hours on end (Just trying to find the exit!). And don't even think about going hiking  and camping!
Overall though, very well made, excellent soles and inner soles. Good quality uppers and materials."
"My wife like it, its a little small but it's ok the L is like M. And definitely see ALL through, she has to put a black shapewer under"
"They are ok and functional. I purchased Dot&Dot packing cubes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dot-Dot-Medium-Packing-Cubes-Most-Durable-Cosmetics-and-Luggage-Packing-Organizers-Easily-Distribute-Weight-In-Your-Luggage-By-Transferring-Cubes-Anytime-4-piece-set-Red-Yellow-Green-Dark-Blue/dp/B00UBC6A2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dot&Dot - Medium Packing Cubes - Most Durable Cosmetics and Luggage Packing Organizers - Easily Distribute Weight In Your Luggage By Transferring Cubes Anytime (4-piece set, Red/Yellow/Green/Dark Blue)</a>&nbsp;later. The color (black) does not look as fancy as Dot&Dot. The material feels cheap (thinner) compared with Dot&Dot."
"Only in one size. It is that hard to make the hat adjustable??
Like the hat design and reversibility."
"I liked everything except the clasp, which is very small."
"these have never fit quite right;  they are very snug.  I have had over 8 pair of clark shoes over the years, this is the only pair I've ever gotten that fit so poorly."
"It ran slightly larger than expected. The fabric was nice and didn't cling, which is what I wanted however it did not work for the purpose I needed it for therefore I chose to return it"
"I bought with my shoe size at the high end of the size range for L based on reviews elsewhere that said these fit large.  I found the opposite and ended up having to return the first pair and go with XL.  And even the XLs, the range of which goes beyond my shoe size, only just fit.

The sole has a raised portion that is inset from the edges.  You can sort of see it in the photo of the sole: raised bumps.  So you're actually walking around on much less area than the whole sole.  Doesn't feel very stable.  Perhaps it will just take getting used to.

On the plus side, construction is good, and the elastic gusset design is great for keeping the slippers on your heels."
"The fact that these say 10-13 in the title would make you think they are big enough to fit a shoes size 10-13, but they are a bit small."
The earrings are bigger than I like but very nice.  I like the look.
This bra will turn your two boobs into a uni boob! Very comfortable. Good quality materiel.
I like the fabric. I cut several inches off the length as they are too long.
"like with some of the reviews, the sides of this shoe come up too high to make it comfortable.  I wear a Merrell 10 and these are 10.5, but a hair too small.  I think if the side weren't so high, they might have worked.  This is a great color."
The tag itself is very good but the clear plastic that covers the info card is trash. I bought 4 of these and the very first time we used them  the clear plastic got torn out of one. And we only used 2 of the suitcases they're attached to. Pretty bad odds.
Cute shoes but I ordered the wrong size so mime are too big
"I wear size small ,6 7/8, and this hat is tight. Hoping wear will make it more comfortable. Works great!"
It does the job. Good weight its light but doesn't tip over. The only thing is I use it to photograph jewelery to sell online and when you get too close it causes lines and swirls in the pics. It'll do for now until I can get one that's better for me.
"before buying here I even looked up the type on the tag so I'd get the same thing...the store bought ones are much more comfortable...these are good, I like them, but they are a bit snug, including a certain area that should not be snug for a guy to remain comfortable...yes they do show off my back side rather well, better than the store bought ones, but I would trade having a less visible shapely tush for more comfort down the middle if you catch my drift."
"These are very thin, really too thin to wick sweat.  They fit well enough and are comfortable enough, but seem to ride down at the waist band a bit.  Overall, they are OK, but not my go to boxer briefs."
"I followed the measuring guide and for the most part, this dress fits, however,  in what  realm is a size 8 to 10 considered a XXL?  The empire waist  sits on the bottom of my breast line.  I feel like the whole dress just fits weird,  however,  it's not bad enough to send back and it gets the job done.  For the amount that was paid, I am satisfied."
"I have decided to purchase this tote after reading the 5 stars reviews. Honestly, the larger tote, which does not have any top zipper and also has very short shoulder straps is kind of not usable. Of course you could carry it in your hand but it looks like a shopping bag rather than a nice purse. The tote which has the longer strap and top zipper is just ok. but for this price there are better totes to purchase on Amazon. The leather itself seems to be good quality and I wish both pieces were equally usable for every day."
I like the pockets and zippered areas. The snap is really tight--hard to undo. And at the end of the day it wasn't big enough for my stuff. I use for traveling when I don't have as much stuff to carry around.
"Disappointed at the color, the picture shows a light khaki, but you actually get am almost taupe  color. Not to mention that the size was a bit large. It is wrinkle and stain resistant which is nice and we decided it was worth keeping."
Toe box too shallow. Shoe is cut narrow. I like the round toe in Vionic much better.
"Its okay, I would order one size larger though."
Should of had a shorter length.
"Love the skirt, however, it is a very tight fit. I am rounder than I once was and this just doesn't work."
I like these boots a lot I just wish they had a zipper down the side to make them easier to get in and out of.
"After all the reviews, I bought a size up. Wish I had bought my usual size. It was fine in the bust area. I'm a 34C. The waist seems high on the dress and it looks pleated instead of flowing. Very short dress. I'm sending the dress back."
"Exact copy of original but rubber quality is poor, very light and cheap to the touch.. Not original Tawatec style of band for sure!!"
Not the quality that I associate with Docs.
"I am in love with the necklace itself the beads are beautiful and its light weight and soft , but when it came it was broken the clasp had come off and it was not attached to the card board that hold the bag together. I am really bummed out because I bought this as a gift for my sister in laws birthday. I gave it three stars because the necklace itself is so beautiful, but broken when it came after two months of waiting and now i have to buy another gift for my sister in law."
It's too small and no 1/2 sizes to choose from. I had to cut the corners just to make them fit better. They are ok for what I wanted (outside shoes)...
I would've liked to give these packing cubes 5 stars but I can't because the zippers are very flimsy. The packing cubes are nice sizes and the additional secret pouches are very useful. I gave these to my daughter to help her pack neatly for sleepaway camp.
"10 inches is REALLY short... and it's not very fluffy.  A little disappointed, but can make it work for what I needed it for."
"Very thin Faux leather But looks good. If you want real quality  quality try Spanx, but be prepared to pay significantly more. In s hort you get what you pay for."
It comes on time but the color of the metal changed very soon. I think I'll not use it for a long time.
"Should expect that to be heavy, but I wasn't aware. This pair is pretty heavy, originally look means there is a little tiny 'nipple' pumps up on the silicone."
"It's not the best product, it really feels good, but it was too small."
I like the cushion for walking..I don't care for the material that much
Definitely right across the bust line.
stiff and a bit warm
This is a very simple semi straight tee shirt dress.  Its smaller and shorter than I expected.  I will probably wear it around the house in the summer but would never wear it outside. That said I am 66 and if I were younger and thinner I might.
Not a huge fan of the material. Feels really thin.
"Im usually a medium size, ordered the XXL taking in consideration the size chart provided and it was still snug.."
"This pen helps to hide shadows under your eyes or any other flaws one might want to cover up.
The pen works by turning the top and the makeup flows onto a brush. I still find it easier to apply the amount I want with a tube or cream and then if needed use a brush or a make-up soft pad. With your own brush that you can clean or a new pad you have a cleaner application.
 The dark beige was not as dark as someone with very dark skin would probably need."
Not very attractive.
Am giving 3 stars because the color in the photo is not the same as the real shoe as advertised.
"I love the cut of these pants (low rise), but the medium that I ordered is way too small for me. There is no way I'd want to ski in these pants.  I'd be so uncomfortable and restricted through the waist, hips, and thighs.  I am sending them back for a large.  I love the color (I ordered the dark raspberry).  It is so pretty and will look awesome with a white Columbia jacket I just bought.  The Omni-Heat liner in these pants seems like it will keep me nice and warm.  The ""regular"" length I purchased is perfect, so I'm keeping that the same.  I can't wait until the correct size arrives and I can wear them skiing!  [my measurements: height=5'7"", weight=144 lbs, waist=32"", hips=37.5"", inseam=30.5""]

Update: I originally gave these pants 5 stars, but I am changing that to 3 stars because of the sizing issues.  Maybe my body is just weird, but the medium was so tight on me that I could barely bend, squat, move, or button the pants.  However, the large is so ginormous that I am swimming in these pants.  I still love the color so I am going to keep them, but I had to cinch the adjustable waistband so tight just to make sure the pants won't fall down.  Because I had to cinch so much, the hips on the pants flair out, making me look like a Canadian Mountie (and I actually have quite narrow hips in relation to the rest of my proportions).  Anyway, most of the weird fit through the hips will be covered by my jacket, so I guess the pants will be fine.  I don't love them, but I like them enough to keep them.  I just wish they made a ""medium and a half"" size.  LOL."
"True to size, but stone MUCH darker green than the picture shows."
Soo super cute. Look just like the picture. I am normally a 7 1/2 or 8. I ordered the 8 and it was still too small. I would say but a 1/2 size up. The toe part is shaped weird. Kind of cuts of your big toe. Ow. Otherwise very cute. Have to return. Too  uncomfortable
"Super cute, but only lasted a month. I normally only purchase Skechers for my daughter, but now have switched brands."
"Basic Shemagh. Nice and warm, and large."
"Pretty, but printed on one side only."
"Qulaity isn't great, looks cheap but fits any body shape great!"
"These are small - there's no way they will fit a toddler that wears a 3T.  I bought them for my 22 month old grandson, they are going to his 4 month old sister instead.
They are adorable - animal fronts and backs, cute colors, nice selection - just poorly sized."
Very cute shoe but too small so had to return
"Cute slippers but run small. My little one wears a size 12-13 preschool shoe. She measures 12 1/2
We ordered the 13-1 and they are a little small with no room to grow at all"
Looks fine but does open up to the top notch where it suppose to hold.
"its was bigger than I expected,  however, I rocked it"
"I had purchased item
I have used this item and I will not ask others to buy this.
Because this is ok in quality."
"I ordered a small (I used the measurements according to Cherokee's sizing chart (I'm a size 4/6) ) and it was HUGE. Aside from the size discrepancy, the shirt seemed pretty well made and the color was exactly as expected. Returned."
"Just only I love is Color (hot pink) and inside, That all.

BUT few negative comments on this handbags is RIGHT because It's cheap and could broke off if you use daily or heavy stuff. I advice to you save extra money to buy bit expensive reliable handbags like Michael Kors or Coach, etc. That's what I start notice that gold button start weak and NEAR broke fell it. I guess you get what pay for. I kept it BUT sometimes use it. If you love cheap price handbag, well this for you but you must be careful with this handbags because cheap purse WON'T last longer.. All Can I have say.."
They work for what i need
"It looks great on the model, in person I notice it doesn't have any shape or curve to it, just straight material :("
I love the bracelet. It doesn't look cheap. However it fits me very loose. I have small wrists  so I have to wear it with a watch in front so it doesn't slide off.
"don't get me wrong, im pretty impressed with how quickly this came and how little seems to be able to go wrong with it - it's very straight forward -- my only issue is that it is a little bit bulky in terms of pushing your mouth open -kind of like those fake hillbilly teeth.

however - they're still hilarious and fab and super shiny and they look legit! so funny."
May need to purchase a size bigger than your normal size or you won't be able to zip it up ig you have a stomach.
"Did not return this dress, but it is larger than I would have thought it to be per size or perhaps I ordered it too large...?. It is long as photo indicates... guess I will use in summer or as a over bathing suit with tie up."
THIN T SHIRT
"I did not expect something that would last or look as though the queen would wear it. What I didn't expect was that it would look as crappy as it did. No,obviously I didn't give it as a gift, if someone had given it to me I would have known how much they didn't like me !!

Update: this business gave a credit and a phone call immediately, I would not hesitate to buy from this company again."
"hard to give it a star rating when they don't fit but they're decent looking, not bad quality and a decent price.  of course i've got to either give them away or return them but my son certainly cant wear them"
"These are very nice looking sandals, but the leather is a bit somewhat and stiff, so not as comfortable as I would hope. They are moderately okay to walk in. Maybe they'll soften up."
"These were very short on my daughter. Shorter than they appeared in the picture. She's only 10, so she can wear them around the house or over a swimsuit this summer. Totally inappropriate for wearing out."
"Nice quality, but little stretch in fabric. Not ideal for my athlete.  He says it doesn't flex enough at the knee. Returning."
Socks are much thinner than I expected and after 2 washing some already have holes at the seam in the heel.
"Bought it from the site because of a user noting it seemed 'old'. Waited a while for it to arrive, when I finally got it I was excited I thought I found a good product. Naturally my boots were already worn and I was simply buying this to repair them. 23$ is a lot to ask for a simple boot repair when a fat bottle of Shoe Goo is sitting right next to it in the recommendations spot for 8$.

But because of the stellar reviews and their big claim they use it in all the major league baseball sports teams, I thought it'd be a good bet. I made sure to watch the video several times, all through it, repeating sections, listening to his every word like he was a pastor. Followed the instructions and tore my boots up to make sure this stuff would stick to a clean solid surface (I had placed beeswax on my boots before to protect them from the elements)

1 week, the sides are starting to come off.

Next time, I'll just buy the big bottle of Shoe Goo so when the time comes I have to repair it, I won't have to be 'dainty' with my drops because of the limited amount in the darn thing, should a piece start to come off.

I'm a commercial sheet metal roofer, my job requires a lot from my feet. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed at the sides already coming off after a week. In spite of sanding away the toe, ensuring plenty of cover space, tearing off excess leather and cleaning the sole of the boot for proper 'sealing.'

I'll just consider it a 23$ lesson learned. Might be tough enough for a guy throwing a ball all day, but it's s*** for a guy who has to actually work to earn his living."
"I bought this to replace an icebreaker pocket hat that I lost, but I ended up just getting another pocket hat. This guy is super nice and much heavier weight than the pocket hat, but for some reason icebreaker wants me to walk around with their name scrawled across my forehead like an idiot. Now I saw that in the photo, and thought I could just turn it around, but there is a big seam running up the back that makes it uncomfortable to wear backwards. It seems like itd be a great hat if you don't mind being a billboard..."
"Got these for my bf since he had another pair same style diff color. This color is a bit different than the color he had, since they were lower in the waist area and a bit more snugg. Apparently each color is made with diff materials so if you like a color and fit, check the label and make sure the materials/composition is the same or you will get a diff fit."
"The Good:

1) Ample vibration protection. The gel pads really do work. I put several hundred miles on these last few weeks and they're very comfortable and protect my hands.

The Bad:

1) Fits VERY tight. I ordered a large and they're skin tight
2) Cheaply made. They're already wearing out after only a few rides. The Velcro is coming apart from the glove.
3) Because they're small, they're a major PAIN to get off when my hands are damp with sweat.

Overall? A pretty ""meh"" product. I wish that they had a higher build quality. If you order a pair, get a size larger than you think you need."
It's not as fluffy as I wanted
"Everyone loved this dress.  It was perfect for the winter performance. However, it is a one time dress.  It was made of cheap fabric and wasn't built to last.  It isn't one of those dresses the kids can play with their cousins running around the house on Christmas Eve.  It would probably fall apart at the waist had she been playing in it.  So the price was perfect for just what I needed it for."
It was kind of a low quality shirt.
Bought this bag for my wife as a gift. The cookies are exactly as in the picture and it's very cool my wife lived the design my problem was that it is pretty small so you can't really fit to much inside it
Good quality shirt but the length is pretty silly. Good for a base layer.
"Cute, but my son's name was misspelled on the charm."
"I received these earrings about a week ago. My gold hoop earrings broke and I was looking for something to replace them with. I did not want to spend a lot of money on another pair of gold hoop earrings and found these. I have to say I am not liking these as much as my broken earrings. They are pretty, but they are oval. The biggest issue is that the earrings are really heavy to me and when inserted into my earlobes, they started to burn! I am not sure it was because the earrings were heavy or because the rods that go into the ears were too thick? I will wear them and hopefully those issues go away as I get use to them. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but thought I would make note of it.

UPDATE: These earrings are crap! I figured out that the burning sensation in my ears had nothing to do with the weight of the earring, it was due to the fake metal content in the posts. Also, the first time I wore these, one of the clasps on an earring did not clasp and the earring fell onto the floor. The second time I wore them, I actually lost the earring because of the clasp! So, I have downgraded my rating from a generous 3 to a 1."
Heavier  than I expected.
"My wife is 5'2"" 150lbs. 36DD up top. This coat looks tight on her and i bought her a XXL because of her top. It is very form fitting. I am affraid she's not going to wear it because of this. She says it show her belly off too much because it is so tight. Hope this review helps."
These shoes are made of rough material that rub my daughter's feet. She rarely chooses to wear these shoes because of the discomfort.
Good quality product. Just too small for the size I ordered.
OK for the price. These will expand with wear so I would size down a size or even two if you want a snug fit.
"The color of this mask is not as bright & vibrant as the picture. I was a little disappointed when I got it. The darker feathers were also not very long & fluffy like the ones depicted in the picture. This mask is OK...but I was expecting more of a ""pop"" or a ""wow"".
I purchased this mask for a party, but was not happy with it's ""dull"" look (compared to the picture). I shopped around for an alternative."
"Looks cool, but cheap. Material is almost mesh and lets light through."
"After only one week -- the front lapel is almost totally separated from the robe.  Going to have to take it to my local tailor for repair.
Other than that, I would have given this robe 5 stars."
I bought these shirts in size Large for my husband. The shirts fit as expected and are tag free. The material is thin though so I hope they hold up.
"I ordered small... i liked but... i don't like that much ...The fabric is wrinkle  and i don't like ironing ...after 1 month of use it doesn't look so white, and it isn't as thick as the Geneva model. I rather geneva model 1000 times .. but amazon does not sell it... is more  cute... but well it is not my favorite ... the only cute thing is the design of the sleeves."
"5 beads were already off the veil when i received it in the mail. the comb on it is very fragile, thin like recycled plastic. the tulle is stiff i hope i can doctor it up in time for my wedding"
"All my shoes, are Keen, love and very comfortable. Each pair are the same size. This pair, I send back, for to large. Order a half size smaller. Fit seems, still large. I haven't really wore, shoes, just for a couple hours. If, I go to a smaller, size. Might be too small (?) will wear with a heavier socks. Doesn't seem to fit, like my closet full of keen shoes. Which, are ""Omg these are comfortable "" even with first time putting on.
Cute shoes,"
The socks fit well but seem tight at first
two hard for my feet
"These are cute, but very tight in waist. For reference I'm a pretty small person, 5""0, 107 lbs and these fit me very tight in the waist giving me muffin top. They're not completely see through but will definitely need nude underwear underneath. Overall, my 2 year old loves them on me so I will keep them cause they're decent for the price."
Narrow toe box..gave them to my son because his foot is narrower than mine. He likes them.
"This is an ok coat considering the sleeves were too short for my 9 yr old...other then that the coat was well made. I thought i was slick and got my daughter a size up(10/12)And it was still to small for her,so buyers beware!"
"These are very cute. My daughter loves the bright colors and the fun characters. Unfortunately, the are coming apart after only a couple of months of wear."
Runs small this was purchased to be mother of groom dress Im returning it and purchased a even bigger size
"soft and comfy.  one leg is longer than the other and some seems are already coming loose.  I'm 5'5"" and usually a small-medium or size six and the S/M fits me fine."
"Not bad hat, if your going for a cowboy/witch hat-"
I loved the print but he use seemed to big for me. I'm a small 5 ft 2in. And it just look too big for me.
little wobbly
"Love the look to these sunglasses, but unfortunatly they are a little tight on my head. They are smaller than others I have purchased. I gave them to my daughter."
returned did not love the look. made my feet look big
Good quality and a perfect fit.
"I've owned various brands of wallets similar to these, including Rolf and Buxton, for more than 25 years. I like to have a wallet with the attached keychain ring so that I can carry everything I need without a bulky purse. Imagine my surprise to see that the keychain is attached in the section that is zippered, making it virtually impossible to keep that section zipped if you use the keychain!!!! That should be the most secure part of the wallet, but the coins can fall out because it won't stay zipped completely. Who would design such a ridiculous location for the keychain? On every other wallet I've owned, the keychain was attached to another part of the wallet that avoided problems with holding in items securely. Very disappointed that the engineering of this was so ill planned. Getting very hard to find good design and manufacturing in products today."
"These sandals are cute out of the box, but I found them to look and feel too wide for my average foot.  My foot slipped around in them and felt unstable.  Unfortunately, I had to send them back."
"I love these boots! I work on hard cement all day. I have flat feet & usually feel pain in my heels by the end of the day.. so far so good with these. If you need more arch support you may need to put in a different insert.  These are super lightweight (thanks to the composite toe) & super comfortable. I usually wear a 8.5W boot in women's but there are not many options for women's pull on work boots.  Im super happy I got these.  I ordered the 7 3E and they fit perfect with thick socks.  I will be ordering again.

1 week UPDATE: Im only on day 5 and Im wearing out the inserts already. I have heel pain too. My friend swears by red wing inserts so Ill be buying some today.

Feb 2018 UPDATE: I bought the $50 red wing inserts and have had 0 pain in my feet. These things are freakin amazing... The boots ended up not being waterproof.  Water has seeped in & are now smelly. They have held together though since September but I really need it to be waterproof.  I still love the look of theses boots but next time will try spraying them & buying red wing inserts from the start."
"Much smaller than described.  Wanted to take it as a carry on, but it was too small for my needs.  Nice bag but did not take on my trip."
Very cute rain boots however it does run small. I'm a true 6 for both length and width. These boots make my toes scrunch a bit. Since I purchased these for a trip I was not able to exchange for a larger size in time. Keep that in mind... runs a little short lengthwise!
"I read other reviews saying it fit really small/tight so I bought the next size up. It was completely unwearable, it was huge. I have a large chest and that didn't even make a difference the shirt just hung off me. I had to wear another costume to my event. Really disappointed."
"Very good quality product and I think it seems to be very sturdy, which would have been perfect for my daughter who can ruin shoes in 2 days.
But the top front was really bothering her and hurting her foot, because she felt it was too tight. My daughter is pretty skinny and doesn't have wide feet and it was the same for the next size up. Ending up buying again the stride rite that are super comfortable but will last less."
Little thinner than I expected but otherwise I like.
"My 4 year old picked this out, not exactly my style, but hey, she loves it! ;) Not extremely high quality but perfect for a child to play dress up!"
they seem to run a little narrow compared to other brands
"A bit tight in the bust and more green than teal in real life, but still a nice dress"
Purchased as gifts and not observed in use yet.  The test of performance has not been evaluated but they were cute.
Omg it pains me (literally) but these shoes are too tight for my (admittedly) wide feet. I normally get a wide or double wide if possible and these just didn't work. I knew it when I tried them on but kept them because of the awesome style. Unfortunately they didn't stretch out and there's a weird ridge on the inside near my pinky toe knuckle that just digs in.
"I usually like Asics, but the cushion on these hasn't lasted as long as others. It could be because I've been using them for the elliptical mostly rather than running (over the past four months), but I would still prefer to have more cushion in the ball and toe. I think I may need to replace these much sooner than I usually do."
"I just received this blouse today.  I am glad I read the helpful reviews prior to ordering because instead of ordering a small or even a medium, I ordered a size large, based on what I had read.  It fits perfectly! I am wearing t with a pair of cute, white skinny jeans, wedges, and a long pendant necklace.
The quality of the top is just okay...  But, I had already somewhat expected it, thanks to the reviews.  The shoulder elastic seems strong.  The ties at the cuffs are a cute added touch....  One thing about the color:  I ordered in grey. The photo portrays the color as being slightly darker in color of which I expected and would have preferred.  The color I received IS in the grey ""family' however lighter than anticipated, and there seems to be a slight cast of lavender.  It is still pretty, and, hey, can't beat the price!"
Changing my star rating to three. I don't really like the one back pocket thing and the back pocket you do get is tiny. Barely holds my wallet in both terms of width and height. Seems very easy to get pick pocketed or just straight up drop your wallet by just keeping it back there.
"Bathing suit material, and I didn't think through those cute straps. You know, those straps that all just bunch together and aren't really that cute. Alright novelty shirt to look hot for a few minutes."
"nice size, cheap qualitity"
"Shoes were sparkly pretty. My daughter is in between 6 and 7. However, I found these shoes in 7 'bigger' than some Keds I just bought her. Was hoping to use it for a princess costume..."
"The product is good, but the sizes are not correct, my 6 year old son is small."
A lil too tight.
"I bought these thinking they whould be the same as the ones I purchased at Costco many years ago.  These were not! The fabric is strechy but after only a few washings the material seems like its starting to pile.  There appears to be some sort of discoloration on areas like the kness that get more wear.  I do wear them for work and like the stretch, just wish they were better quality."
"It's an okay shoe.  I ordered a D and it was too wide so I sent it back.
I was disappointed to find it was made in China."
"These are slightly cute, works well tonkeep your feet warm, but they fit a bit awkward."
Fits slightly small. Does stretch a bit in the body but wears thin throughout the day. The sleeves shrink after washing and become 1/2 to 3/4 length sleeves.
"Fabric is a jersey material. Fits well, but can cling to certain areas."
"Forgive if this is somewhat crass, but I feel you'd have to have really small, perky breasts for something like this to work well for you. I have 31 year old d-cup boobs, so this did not really help me much. Shame, it's comfy, but just doesn't really do much for me."
Nice but not what I was looking for
they stretched very quickly
"The shoelaces are very thin, and not very robust.  I expect they will not last long.

Also, in the review, they questions assume this product are shoes, which they are clearly not.  So, disregard those answers (""How did the width of these shoes fit?"", etc.)."
"I was expecting smooth surface like the photo. The bag is actually bumpy, as if the leather has goose bumps I returned for a full refund. Excellent customer service."
Not as long as i expected but its a nice dress.
"The tab on the zipper on one boot snapped off after a few months of wear. About four months later, the tab on the zipper of the other boot snapped off. I must use a tool (Phillips-head screwdriver or pliers, etc.) to zip them now. They are very comfortable for waterproof boots, but the zippers are almost useless."
"It is a great sweater, just need to own a sweater shaver, as this sweater will be pilly in no time at all!"
"Fabulous color and knit, WAY TOO SHORT for my husband or son, 6'4"" & 6'6"" respectively."
Very cute and delicate necklace. A little hard to see the initials that are engraved.
Great support. Realty looks fantastic. But its not as comfortable as the similar Just My Size front closure bra.
"I love the style of these shoes, but I needed to buy a great insole to go inside.  They offer NO support.  After the first day of wear I noticed that my feet hurt quite bad while wearing them.  By day two I needed to get some insoles to make up for what they lacked in comfort.  I love the style of them though, so I'll just have to keep replacing the insole inside as needed."
"I've never had real TOMS before so I'm not sure what to compare them to. But the soles of these shoes are very very slippery. I had to add pads to the bottom for more grip. They feel very lightweight and ""cheap"". And the price was not very cheap for the quality.  They do fit perfectly fine."
Nice but to bad it came with a dead battery
"I really did like the idea of this, but the top fit more like an underbust than a bra. There was no support at all. The bottoms fit fine, but the top seemed like it's made more for fake breasts. Breasts that stay put and don't have a mind of their own. Maybe ""less aged"""
"I have a HUGE head (generally need a men's XL in hats) and very thick hair and this particular turban in red runs large even on me. The polyester fabric is ok, and the style is attractive, but I would only recommend this if you plan to tuck a LOT of hair inside. I've purchased similar styles in different fabrics, so the size issue may just apply to the solid color poly versions- the metallic and velvet versions seem to fit much more snug. The quality is fine, but I just can't figure out whose giant head of hair the sizing is meant to fit."
"Super chunky and the face is much darker than shown, almost like the glass is tinted.  Hard to see the time."
It looks to be a size 8 or 10 so I've just thrown it up on the top shelf in my closet.
"The band was a solid 4 inches smaller than I expected from the size. I have ordered other bras from wacoal and never had this problem before, but this was bad enough that I had to return it.
This also wasn't the shape I expected. Probably as part of the sizing issue, the underwire wasn't far enough back underneath my arm and dug in pretty badly. Wacoal usually does a good job with having wide cups, so this was weird."
"I got this for a guy friend and got a medium but it was pretty big for a medium when we washed it, it shrunk funny and was shorter and still too wide. Other then that its one B.A. shirt. Annnnd the color hasn't faded."
nice and warm.  soft and plush. just fits a little small.
PLUMBERS CRACK SHOWS..........A LITTLE SHORT IN FRONT.  MY P...S ALMOST SHOWS ON TOP OUTSIDE.
Returned them because they were a bit small and I didn't like the uneven tread feel under the ball of my foot and big toe.  I suspect they are designed this way because both shoes felt the same.
I was some satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing shoes from this source again.
"The color and fit are fabulous, but the hem was coming undone and the netting overlay was torn after the 2 year old had it on for 1 hour. It's soft and not scratchy!"
When I'm breaking the finger webs can dig into my hand.  The padding is rigid and sparse. I think if your looking for a padded glove this isn't it.  If your looking for a n9n padded gloveg this isn't it.  I just purchased a set of specialized body geometry gloves.
It is not all that easy to use and inconvenient.  Would only use while boating for example.
"I started training for a marathon, this is my first sneaker that is specially geared for running, did one 5k run/walk in them. they were comfortable. I purchased on size bigger then I usually wear since I was told to expect some foot swelling when running.
So far happy with my purchase"
This runs small so go up a size.
"During this last cold snap, I had to put on another pair of socks with these.  Not worth the price."
"Cute dress for summer. It was a bit loose on top, but for the most part, it fit well. Nice summer dress on a beautiful summer day."
For me it was a little bigger then I expected but it was cute and worked for the event I needed it for.
"For an active kid, get a more durable shoe. Holes formed in the toes after two months."
"Colors are better than expected, very comfortable. They shrink more and more with each wash, they are half the size as when i bought them. AND they fall down. How can the be both too tight and fall down?"
Nice jeans. Comfortable food material. Its just kinda low in the waistband. If I bend over my but crack will show. I got a size 32. And I wear a size 10 or 12
Fit like a 7& 1/2 instead of an 8. The wide width is very good!!! The design of this shoe is perfect for bunions!!! The stretchy mesh is right at the bunion area of my foot. No pressure pain. Perfect! But I did have to return the 8 for an 8&1/2 because the shoe is too short. I wear a size 8 wide in all other shoes but this shoe sizes short. I just received my 8&1/2 and it runs just a bit too short but tolerable because I have bad bunions and the wide width is perfect!
"Nice looking sneaker, but very stiff right now not that great for jogging in, may get more flexible as breaks in."
"Really a ""smushy"" flip flop - gave it to my daughter"
Its just ok. The only one i dnt like is its get my feet sweaty while wearing it.
OK.....
It's okay. It's nice.
Look pretty but very thin. Not the best quality. Inside threats make it hard to put the socks on and toes get stuck.
Nice design with a slimmer and more fitted cut. I'm a bigger frame so the shirt was tight on me.
These are really comfortable and not too warm.  They are very nice looking.  Unfortunately I had a problem when they were washed and the seam on one of the legs  unraveled and I had to sew it closed.  I didn't want to wait for a return so fixing them seemed the best option.
"The boot is very cute, however they do not fit true to size. I wear a 9 and my toes are just short of being smashed in these. Cute, but not comfy."
I have very large calves and the calf portion of these sandals are way too wide. Geez. They seem to be made with some sort of flaw. I love the style of the sandal but the width of the calf part is just not quite what I was looking for. O
CHAMPION MAKES QUALITY MERCHANDISE.
"I purchased 2 pairs of the pink print
i wear 9 1/2 purchased 9 1/2
they are narrow and I have thin feet.
they are snug and can onky be worn for a short time.
i purchased 8 for my child she wears 8 and could bareky stand to be in them an hr. Her foot had red on the back and she can not wear the m again too painful. Going uo a size may make them flop off.
cute print but not sized for every foot, use for short wear only no walking"
"Like the pendant, HATE the chain's design."
Bought this for Halloween last year.  It was a little to short for my long legs (and a little tight...XL may have been better).  I ended up wearing yoga pants so it served its purpose.
I bought one size bigger and its still tight.
"I bought this to replace my deteriorating business card holder that I had been using as a wallet. I should have gone with another business card holder. My biggest issue with this wallet is that the clear window you see in the picture is nowhere near big enough to put a drivers license. And all of my cards fit vertically instead of horizontally. It's just inconvenient for me.
The picture is accurate though. Zipper works fine, lots of space for cards inside."
Purchased to wear to my daughter's wedding.  Just looked in box but didn't pull out until the day of wedding (May 19).  Received one size 8 AND THE OTHER WAS A SIZE 7.5.  Noticed too late to return item so now have a pair of mis-matched shoes I can't even give away.
Did not like the cushioning in this shoe.  Not what I expected
"I ordered US12, which is labeled 4x in china and on the shirt's tag.  I usually wear a size 10 or 12, depending on the manufacturer.  My bra size is 38B and there is no room for my girls.  Now, grated, I do wear a padded bra, so maybe someone else with that size might fit better.  If you wear a bigger bra size, you might not fit.  There is stretch in the shirt and I'm hoping to stretch it out after the wash and let it air dry, because the shirt pulls and I can see in my shirt where there isn't a button.  I wish there wasn't any stretch and it was made bigger.  Other than that, it is a nice shirt, I'm just disappointed that I can't wear it and that there aren't bigger sizes. I wish there were more blouses with a body suit sewed in, so that they fit better and don't get untucked when crouching down.  BTW - always read the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews, because I feel like Amazon is not trustworthy anymore and that reviews are padded with fake 4 and 5 star reviews."
"These shoes are too short, and this is surprising. Other Vionics got just right. These need to be a half size bigger they are a bit too short and hurt my toes. I have to wear band aids with them."
"Not quite what I expected for comfort.  The straps are quite tight over the tops of my feet and I do not have fat feet.  Though, I suppose if they were not so snug, the material would give terrible blisters.  They also hurt the bottoms of my feet and toes, but maybe i'm just too old to be wearing high wedges.  Oh, and they stained my skin black.  I imagine that would go away over time."
"Need mid to high arch to be able to wear these shoes. Since I have neither, they were too baggy on my foot. I returned them."
Too tight and not enough support
To small to wear. Gave them away.
"It's nice but a little TOO thin. So thin, yiu can see through it. Definitely doesn't look as visible as the picture."
"Is a little to soft, I was expecting more definition"
"The profile of these shoes upon wearing is really nice.
Due to the half-size situation with these shoes, I got two colours/types in a size 10(leopard) and 11(yellow) for a size 11.
Well, neither was okay. Though fits okay, toes stuck out way too much beyond boundary on the size 10 and the size 11 was big and unfitting.
It has been my experience that the larger the size, the truer the fit but this was not so for these shoes.
Surely, there must be a difference between 'Fit As Expected' and 'Fit True To Size'.
The former may be true after adjusting your order a half-size up or down but does the shoe actually fit according to the size attached to it?
Unfortunately, there are no size 10.5 in this, so if you are a true size 11, do not bother, unless you want to force it.
Just leave it alone.
Also, shoes arrived separately and the leopard ones came in a horrendous packaging.
Shoe-box was frizzled and crumpled with the the cover fully split at all four corners and separated therefrom.
Was surprised that the shoe had not been impacted in any way!
Quite sad overall."
Really cute swim top but doesn't have good support...there is very little support...
"The color wears off fast when subjected to perspiration, shampoo and soap."
"The way they look its sooo cute!
My foot kind of slides off from side to side, not so stable but they are cute, if they would have been a little cheaper would have been worth it."
"I bought directly from Amazon.

These are very comfortable but they don't match the photos. From a functional point of view, I would rate these 5 stars. They kept my feet warm and dry during the 7+ hours of snow shoveling during the Jonas storm. I am a size 10.5 and the actual fit is true (I did not have to buy a larger size).

I am disappointed by a few things. I bought the ""Dark Brown"" version but the color of the rubber part clearly doesn't match Amazon's photo. Amazon shows the rubber part as nicely matching the color of the top leather. It doesn't. As my photos show, the rubber part is actually tan colored. If you're buying the dark brown version for the appearance, you will be in for a surprise. The black version is more expensive, but maybe Timberland did a better job matching the color of the leather to the rubber. If I hadn't ordered t his right before the snow storm, I would have returned it. The color difference between the top and bottom doesn't look stylish. The tan colored rubber bottom just cheapens the appearance.

Also, after only one use of these shoes in the snow (about 1.5 hours), there was discoloration of the leather. This was very surprising as I hadn't gotten any salt or anything on them. I'll need to find a polish kit or something to fix that."
"Slightly small in the crotch, front is higher than the back, but overall ok."
I wear size 9 or 9 1/2 so I went with a 10 and they are snug. I feel like an 11 would have been too big. Just wish they were true to size.
The color is amazing. The material is shear so a slip underneath will be required. I am a little disappointed that the dress did shrink a little  after the first washing in cold water. It is incredibly comfortable to wear.
"This bag is a perfect size for me, big enough to carry my iPad and it's keyboard in their sleeve as well as my ereader and my insulin paraphernalia (recently diagnosed, which is why I need a bigger bag). I work on the road so I travel with an overlarge wallet for extra currency as well as a notebook to keep track of all my organizing (I know, old style, but it's too easy to tick something off electronically, erroneously or miss typing a contact).

The small zippered cargo pockets are big enough for my travel hot sauce bottle and hand cream and minimal makeup. The tiny magnetic snap closure pockets  are good for my spare bluetooth earpiece and the tiny tin I use for toothpaste so they are easily accessible. Really important things I can put in the inside zippered pocket. My only wish is that the zippered outside pocket in the back was deeper.

This is similar in design to another bag I have that converts to a backpack but that one is smaller and cost more than twice as much. The straps also change length so that this will work for most sized people. It is also easy to go from backpack to shoulder to access the contents. I love the turquoise colour; it will go with everything and is bright enough to stand out. The picture didn't look turquoise but I took a chance. It is turquoise, not green like it as it appears. A great colour for summer.

5/29/16 I've amended my review to three stars from five. I took this on the road and after four days of use one of the snap hooks that attaches one strap to the bottom 'D' ring broke. Where the swivel hook fits into the bar that the strap loops around, the snap hook came apart. I jury-rigged it with string to get me through and in order to fix it the strap would have to be taken apart and a new metal loop with hook applied and re-sewn. Not something anyone can do, especially since over-sewing will destroy the fabric. This is very disappointing since otherwise this was just right for me."
"I'd caution against this hat if your fitted hat size is larger than 7 1/2"". I have a big head, I wear 7 3/4 (61.5 cm) and this thing would barely fit on the last notch. If they stick with a one size fits most, they need an option for the bigger heads out there. P-p-p-please volcom? All the trucker hats seem like they're made for toddlers these days.

Otherwise, nice embroidery and probably easy to accentuate the so-cal bent up brim thing. Not my style personally, but this hat seems to be made for it."
Doesn't block the sun all that well. I went for a run and I didn't make it down the driveway.
It's a bit flimsier than I was hoping for and smaller than I was expecting. Still cute though.
These weren't as flattering as the regular Catherine fit.
"In terms of the length and width, these seemed to fit appropriately.  However, as soon as I started running, I would usually have to loosen them up because the sides and top were extremely constrictive.  The shoes are durable, but quite heavy for any extended run.  The padding around the heel is thick enough to survive severe abuse, but it migrates after a few months.  I've moved on after 11 months."
They are comfortable but after wearing them for a while I noticed they were rubbing and left a sore spot.
"Honestly, the material feels like it will not last long. Make sure you read the sizing carefully because you can end up with a really small jacket."
The fabric makes my feet uncomfortably warm. Can't wear them long enough.
"The waist fits fine but the legs are so wide and baggy it practically gives you the silhouette of a woman wearing a skirt.  Therefore I tend to just wear these around the house, as they look a little too retarded to wear at the gym or anywhere else in public."
Wish the waist band was wider
Very cute but meant for a very petite build.
"Ended up washing in hot water and drying on high.  Now it fits well, and I don't have to worry about it shrinking."
"Looking for a supportive bra for running/half-marathon training. While this is relatively comfortable, I felt like the bra got less supportive as my 4mile run went on; the band also rolled a bit and did some chafing. The higher neck felt a bit odd too, and I must put my fitbit clip on my belt instead of at the bra as I usually do. I also normally need a 34 band on the first clip section or two for a few months, and this one I put on the smallest section right away. I will keep it and use it for cross training or shorter runs, but I imagine it will not last a full year and will keep looking for a stronger running bra."
"I bought this for myself, and it's tiny. It wouldn't even begin to fit my head, but it looked beautiful on my eight-year-old daughter!"
"snug fit, ok material"
Not a bad fit but a little tight in the toes.
These shoes are a bit snug.  The lined (fuzzies) are much more comfortable and warmer than the unlined version of the shoe.  The bottoms on the shoes are very thin and not very durable.  It would be nice if they could withstand wear and tear much better.  I have found a product on Amazon to patch the soles as they wear out much too quickly.  I like the concept but not the durability.
"Bought a half size up and they still felt narrow and pushed on my toes.
I will say that after wearing now for a couple weeks as I shuffle to the shower, the inside padding and fur is starting to flatten out a bit.
I think that's a good thing, it hasn't affected the softness or warmth of the lining, but has resulted in a little more room for my foot.
Still I would like to be able to slip them on more easily."
Too expensive for cotton outfit.
No size was stated for these.  They are definitely for a large child/small adult.
"I'm so disappointed. I love the look of these shoes! I got them in black and nude and was really hoping they would fit. Based on the other reviews, I ordered a 1/2 size down. I could not even get my foot into the shoe, let alone walk in them. I'm not even sure these are a true wide width. If I reorder, I think I will go a size up."
I can almost walk out of my shoe - plus I believed Easy Street to be a decent brand.  The ball of my feet is hurting ten minutes after wearing these shoes.  I had to buy comfort insole inserts to get through a few hours of wearing them.
"I am truly on the fence about this dress.  First, I do not like a V-neck on me, but I've put that aside as a personal bias. I was looking for something packable to wear in the evening when traveling. The material is nice; heavy enough that it doesn't cling to those ""troubled"" body areas, but cool enough for summer.  It's just a bit sheer FOR ME, but I am from the slip generation.  I bought the dress in purple, and it's a nice deep grape.  I also love the pockets!  The back has a cute detail that gives it a bit of a swing effect.  What bothers me are the seams at the top of the split...they stick out.  I tried to press them flat, but it didn't work.  They can be tacked down, but with material like this it will show.  I am 5'5"", and wear a 10 or 12 (depending on cut) in a dress and am a bit busty.  After reading reviews stating that it ran large, I ordered a small. The fit is fine.  A medium would have been much too big. If it had a scoop neck I might be more inclined to keep it, but I would only wear it while at home.  Unfortunately, I can only suggest this dress as a personal preference purchase.  I am going to return this one.  It just doesn't quite make it."
cute pajamas but the top is really long and the bottoms ride up my rear. The two combined makes it look like I have no pants on. Not a pleasant feeling if the grandkids come over.
To say this runs small would be an understatement.  I wear a LG TShirt.  Ordered the XL.  Can't fit over my shoulders.  Order 2 sizes above your normal TShirt size.
"It turns out it's quite dark. After the second coat you can hardly say what shadow is it, looks just very dark."
"I love these bras and usually order the full size. Thought I'd try the plus size this time. Overall the fit is fine but the straps are 1/4"" width spaghetti type. On the other styles they are 1/2"".  Why would they put a 1/4"" on a plus size?  I think they will stretch out quickly. I will go back to the full size next time."
great comfortable shirt
Normal.. But not very good
Did not like fabric
"These look really good my only complaint is that when you walk you hear that cheap plasticy heel noise, not a solid well made sound....if you know what I mean.....if you don't then you probably won't care."
"Just what i wanted!  A durable case for all my cards!  Fits perfectly in my pocket, no bulge!  I just had to trip it up a bit was a little two wide for my preference!"
"Very cute, the fabric feels cheap and loses it's shape easily. However, my daughter looks adorable in the hat!"
"For the money, these probably aren't bad shoes, but I bought them thinking that they would have a removable insole like the other Filas that I found at TJ MAXX a year or so ago.  This model looks very similar in color and design, however not having a removable insole plus virtually no arch support makes them less desirable. That means that if you need arch support you are going to have to add an additional insole or 3/4 insole.  I honestly have not worn them much and I will update after I test them out more.  That said, these are very flat shoes.  The price was very good - that's why I bought them.
Right now I am wearing Saucony Excursion TR10. These are twice the price of these Filas.  These shoes may work for some women, but maybe not for others."
"One side of the stitching connecting the straps to the bag came loose within a week, and then the other side a week after the first, but it was easy enough to fix. That's my only complaint though. Great bag."
"Got this for the price.  I'm please with the helmet, shirt and vest.  But the belt/leg bag fall off easily and the pants are really long.  Given how active boys are, after one wearing (we needed this to make it through 2 wearings) my son split the seam in the pants and didn't want to wear them the second time for his school Halloween parade for fear the hole would get bigger (I don't really sew).  The shirt only has 3 little Velcro rectangles holding it closed, so I made my modest boy wear a shirt underneath.  Other than the shoddy material, he loved this costume and we received compliments on it.  For $30 I was hoping for a little better quality but it sufficed.  Guess his younger brother won't be wearing it."
"The fabric of these socks is ok, but they're kind of small and not a very good fit for me. They can be worn with loafers, and are good for that. Not necessarily as useful for the winter, when it's freezing."
The sequins keep falling off
Probably should have realized it but there is not a lot of support for 38dd but I wanted something stylish for the summer.  I will wear lounging around the house or running errands but definitely will not wear if doing major walking.
Some dye flaws.
The shoes were good quality ... just the wrong size.  They were much too tight.  Had to return them.
"i have a very wide foot.  comfortable for leisure wear, wouldn't suggest all day and expect strong support."
Good quality but they are too fat. It's a husky fit.
"Cute dress, but the lace overlay got pretty messed up after I washed and dried it."
Only lasted 5 months before they got a hole in the sole.
Seems ok - actually accidentally dropped it in water but cleaned out and still durable.  Has enough compartments for everything so I can take alone without bringing heavy purse also.
"Good quality, One of it's strengths is multiple adjustable velcro straps.  This could also be a weakness, it was hard to get them adjusted comfortably, and I did get a small blister the first time I wore them, but only on the left foot.  Take time to adjust and re-adjust before wearing for a full day like I did!  Over time, I have found that the adjustability of these sandals is a detriment.  Even thought they are velcro, under constant stress, the buckles will relax and loosen, and will cause blisters if not addressed with retightening.  Unlike my other high-quality sandals, these have not broken in and molded to my foot as they should.  While they fit well at first, they now sometime seem loose and wishy washy as I walk."
Great value and good quality. Fabric is comfortable.
This dress fit perfectly. When I first got it I found it to be a little stiff and rough to the touch but after one wash it was just fine. Very smooth and the little sparkles are lovely. They must put too much starch in it for shipping or something.
"I like it however, you definitely have to wear a shirt under it"
"Very comfortable shoes and the price was excellent. I wear them pretty much everyday and my feet love them,,,,I would recommend this shoes!!!:-)))"
"I ordered the 2-5 toddler for my 4 yr old with a very large head.  It fits him great and with some adjustment room to grow.  The brim is the perfect size, not to large to flop over like the Iplay hats.  The fact that it floats is good too.  If the strap get tugged on too hard it will release the buckle too which is a nice safety feature.  My son left his hat on during our beach trip.  He would previously take it off and on.  The side vents are nice too for the hot temperatures.  Overall- love the hat!  I was afraid it would be too big based on the pictures but it's not, it's perfect."
"This is a hardcore backpack. It fits my Oakley jacket, Gascan sunglasses several essentials like solar energy pack for a cell phone along with the phone ; hydration containers and much more. Well constructed and the interior pockets are conveniently located. Zippers seem strong and so far no complaints."
"I still love them, they look just like the picture. What I sugguest to someone that feels like the heel is a little snug, put on some lotion on the feet and they feel better."
"While they seemed great we had to return. They were huge on my daughter. I don't know if they run big, but was also told they stretch a little during normal wear. Going to have to find a local retailer to try properly as my daughter has a tiny kids 3/4 foot even at almost 14 yrs. She really wants these boots, but sizing proving to be hard."
Very nice sneaker. I constantly receive compliments on them
I got so many compliments on this dress! It's comfortable and flattering! Love it
I was happy to find another pair of bondi 4.  After 3 foot surgeries these are the only shoes that I can wear comfortably.
My husband loves these and hates slippers!
Best sports shoes I have ever had
Not quiet what he was looking for but did the job...
"I've always been partial to ASICS, and have been running for over 25 years. There have been some failures, but by and large, this isn't one of them. It is a nice, comfortable shoe, not ""heavy"", give plenty of shock protection and padding. A good training shoe, but thus far, I don't think it is ready yet for 13.1 or more. I like it, though, very much as a trainer shoe. Personally, the personalization is nice, but I wish ASICS would offer width, as well as other personalization features."
These are the only underwear that I get.  They fit well and would't use anything else.
"great gloves-soft, pretty, reasonable prices and you can use your cell phone!"
Good for my daughter she loves them!
"Awesome bag, using it for my fishing gear. Perfect amount of space and pockets to fit anything and everything. Highly recommend!"
"I was really glad to find this shoe in my size on Amazon. It's a great every day shoe, sturdy, and I need a 4E, so New Balance is the only brand I buy. Shipping was fast, and I will order again."
"This is a nice color, great quality. The fabric is a little thicker and rougher than I was expecting so the overall feel to it is less dressy than I was hoping."
My daughter loved it and for the price I could not have done better!  Thank you!
Light weight and comfortable . Wore if in Texas in June and felt comfortable
"Okay we are a family of nerds/geeks and Dr. Who fanatics.  My oldest son turned us onto this series and we are addicted to it, the ""Torchwood"" series, ""The Sarah Jane Chronicles"" and...

For Christmas my son needed to be congratulated for his excellent taste and this is perfect!!!"
Amazing running shoes.  Lots of room in the toe box.
"The shoes showed up late but was worth it, I'm on my feet 9+ hours a day at work. I only wear Adidas shoes because of the wide fit. Keep up the good work!!!"
"Beautiful shoes, quality material, the rubber sole makes the grip perfect, the square hills look stylish and solid and make it super comfortable to wear all day long. It looks great with skirts, pants, suits, dresses, etc, very versatile. This is the first time I buy something from BC. Great vegan shoes - I could not be happier. I'll buy one of each color!!"
The shipping and arrival of this product was quite good the product is ok thought it would have a little more control on the top portion but the control is medium also it runs slightly large so maybe if I had bought on size smaller I would have more support on top but all in all a well designed and constructed item and will be wearing under pants and jeans
Love this ring.  So dang comfortable!  And very polished!  True to size!
"This is the first backpack I have owned in after-school life and so far am very happy with it. I use it for travel. I figure that it is like a big and roomy travel cosmetics bag for very fair price. The materials that this pack is made from are top notch, right down to the pockets inside. I bought brown one and although it is not real leather, this one looks pretty much as real leather. I like the configuration of this backpack and it has all of the compartments I need for a tablet, phone or make-up, you name it. At first the shoulder straps felt like they were positioned a little wide but after I got them adjusted just right I find it very comfortable.

Super comfortable and adorable!
Material is light. Perfect for Spring/Summer/Fall
"Beautifully made, they all look great and came in a nice little pouch."
Love these.  Lots of compliments.
Nice sweater for my son for Christmas.
Merrell always makes a great product. Especially if you have flat feet. The fit was fine. It was the look that I did not like. So I returned them!
These have very nice color. My daughter is 7 and wears size 7/8 clothing. The tights are pretty snug around her waist. I love that they are not going to snag easily. They are thick and wash well. I just wish the waist wasn't quite so snug.
"Well-made hat.  I have difficulty with the sizing choices that the manufacturer makes available to the consumer.  S, M, L, XL, AND XX-L are not nearly specific enough to provide a hat wearer a decent fit.  I returned my hat, because it was too large, and the next smaller size was too small.  Also, this hat's brim is fixed in place.  Some folks have used steam to reshape their hats, but that shouldn't be necessary in the first place, after spending so much to buy this hat.

UPDATE: for 2015
 It's bad that these fedoras don't have finished edges on their brims.  If so, it might prevent the delamination effect in the appearance.  Caution:  Be aware of T. J. Vogue's ""free shipping.""  If they're not at fault due to a hat defect, etc., they will deduct their """"restocking fee"" from your return refund amount.  They collect the money to recoup their ""free shipping"" costs of sending the hat to you.  In addition, you will pay for return shipping.
Lastly, be advised that Amazon.com currently (June 2015) is stuffing their IJ 554 fur felt hats into very undersized plastic bags, prior to placing that bag into a shipping box.  The stuffing act involves bending and folding which causes deformity to the fur hat's shape.  Sometimes deep creases result that weaken the hat's crown structure."
Holds the larger over the glasses sun glasses.
"Perfect.. XL fits like a large, just as sizing get said it would."
"I bought this bra for the price. I prefer to try them on because even within the same brand and type, bras can fit differently. However, going to a specialty shop means paying specialty prices. I went and got professionally fitted (I'm a 36FF) and bought that size for this bra online.

The fabric is not itchy and does look very pretty. For me, I found that it runs a little big in the cup size and the fabric bunches where the lace meets the fabric underneath (you can see the line across the breasts in the picture).

This happened with certain bras that I tried on in my fitting. Going down one cup size usually did the trick. Still, I'd recommend buying your actual size since even within the same size and color, different clothing items can fit differently. That's a risk you take with buying online.

TL;DR: It's a nice bra. If I buy it again, I'll go down a cup size."
"Ordered these for my boys. One is 10 years old (wears size 2.5) and the other is 5 years old (wears size 11.5). Let me tell you, it took me a while to figure out what size to order for my kids because there were so many mixed reviews about the sizes and which to order. I ordered the sizes 9-2.5. That fits perfectly for my 2 boys! Remember the size 9 is in toddler/kinder size and 2.5 is for older kids. So if you decide to order size 3-9 (in the package it will say size Large), you are ordering the larger sizes which will more than likely fit kids ages 11 and up (that's why there are some adults saying that they can even fit them). So if you have children who are about 10 years old or younger, I suggest order the size I ordered which is 9-2.5 (in the package it will also say size Medium). Also, my order did come with different colors and not just all gray but I don't mind that at all. The kids sure don't. The material has a good amount of thickness to it and the length up the leg is pretty long as well. As long as my boys like it, it's good enough for me! ;) I hope my review will help solve some people's concerns! Happy shopping!"
"Love the Alex and Ani bracelets.  I wear 3 to 4 at a time mixing the silver and gold.
I have not had any problems with the quality."
These shoes are very cute and comfortable - I like that they have unique styling.
"Great quality, perfect fit. Outside pockets are perfect size and location, not too high on chest like some vests or jackets. Seems durable but will not roll around in gravel with it. Overall a true 5 stars."
Love them and wear them all the time!
"Since edges are scalloped, it's looks great as a sunbrella too. Automatic button is for open & closing it.  I would have given it 5 stars but shipping took too long."
"My daughter loves the Cheer bag, I loved the price it was delivered on time. Thank You!!"
Really like A-tac pants.
"I have these in about 10 different colors. I love them. I wear them to work and with heels and a nice top, they can be made dressy."
"I've had these boots for over a year now, and they're
holding up quite well.  Very soft and pliable, something
you could wear all day with no problems.  I ordered a
71/2 W, and they fit perfectly.  I would recommend
these boots."
Not like your usual t-shirt. Much better. So light weight for the summer. Pug couldn't be cuter. Great little guy on front and to my surprise on the back. This is a winner.
Great Top and even keeps my 36-DDD in place
"They keep water out when I walk in the rain. I put my Plantar Fasciitis insoles in them, and that provides good arch support for me. They're tight around my calf a bit, but I have trouble with that in all taller boots. Nothing unexpected."
Very nice quality!  Easy access pockets and very stylish!  Would give it more stars if possible.
Beautiful!  My daughter loved these for Christmas.  They sparkle and look genuine.
This ring is ENORMOUS but nice quality. My husband wears it riding his motorcylce!!!!
nice and simple just how I like it.  The clasp is tight so it holds on.  a link or two might need to be removed for comfort.
Couldn't bet this price I love these and the short height!!
"I expected thinner one,but it's ok.  I think 3pair of socks and this price is very good deal. I like it."
Great fit!  Very comfortable pants!!
"My daughter loves it!  Happy kid, happy mom!"
Stay secure on foot.
Boots wear as advertised.  Just returned from a polar bear expedition and boots were comfortable in +3 to -3 C. temps.  I ordered a 1/2 size larger and they fit great.  Very satisfied.  Wore them for 10 hour days and felt comfy all day.
"Now that I have tried these I can't live without them.  When you run or walk a lot your feet tend to get a little swollen, these laces give you plenty of extra room to run a marathon and the added convenience of not having to tie them. Next Sunday my first triathlon and I can go from swimming to biking with much more ease."
Bought these in black and in white for my 5-year old son. He has always complained that his socks hurt his feet.  He loves these.
"works well and fits true to size for water aerobics and the beach. bought them for my mother so she can use them at the gym, Senior water aerobics and on vacation at the beach."
This is perfect for a new dress that called for a slip which I usually do not wear. Fit is as expected.
This shirt is so soft and the design is nicely printed. the pockets aren't too deep but my lipgloss and hair tie fit inside nicely. Its a bit big but i like it that way. Nice with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings.
Belt was bought awhile ago and still holding up well good belt i recommend getting it
"I have recently lost 30 lbs. and all my bras were too big.  This was the best fitting bra I could find...in my new size, which is a 34G.  Finally, a bra that makes me look normal size without ""minimizing"" and smashing flat, and no more bulging out of the top.  Really pretty too.  Only got four stars because the underwire does stab under the arms a bit, but you can't have everything.  It's still the best fit I could find.  Only bad thing is, it's discontinued!  It never fails, if I like something, the company somehow hears about it and says, NO MORE!  Sharon likes it, so it must be bad! LOL  So I bought six...for now.  May get more before they disappear.  I do recommend this one highly.  It really supports in a pretty way, not pointy, not droopy, just right."
"These are extremely comfortable and sexy (considering where they'll be worn, they aren't workboots so comfort is relative).  The only problem I foresee is the excessive interest displayed by my male cat (who already has a female shoe fetish).  Very pretty, sexy and not so high you can't walk around in them.  I'm very pleased with this purchase."
A little large but still work for me.
"This is heavy duty, it will last a long, long time and I highly recommend it."
my husbands favorite style of levis.  great pair of jeans.
The Levi 514 always provides a great fit. The odd size--33 inches--is a real plus; it is an ideal size that fits my body size and shape. There  is a wide variety of styles to choose from and they all fit.
Great color and nice size bag
Nice quality shirt; great picture!
I use these for indoor aerobics and strength training only.  There is good lateral support but it still allows for foot flexion so my arches don't get sore.
They produce
My favorite shoes! They are very comfortable and were easy to break in. I measured my foot before ordering and they fit great.
"My best friend's daughter has been in love with Minnie Mouse since she was a tiny tike. They just got back from Disneyland and the trip only served to renew her fondness of Minnie. She has her ears pierced and I was shocked to find that she did not own any Minnie Mouse earnings to wear. I saw these and thought that they would make the perfect Christmas present! They are pretty and sparkly, while still being simple and subtle- which I think is perfect for a young girl. They are small, but not so small that they are difficult to pick up and remove the backing to. As they are a Christmas gift, I cannot comment as to how they look on her or if they irritate her skin at all, but I will update my review accordingly after she tries them on. The gift bag the come in is a nice touch, though I would prefer a small box. One of the rods was slightly bent when I received it, but not enough to be noticeable, I wouldn't think. I am excited to see what she thinks when she opens these. I'm sure she will love them!
DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW."
Nice comfortable fit. I like them a lot. The laces kinda suck cause u have to unlace first 2 eyelets to get boot on. Good fit though!
"This item arrived very quickly along with my new watch, so I put it to work immediately to remove three links.  It's just like the one I used when I worked at a jewelry store, so I knew how to use it, and it worked just fine.  I think this is cheaper than taking the new watch to a store to shorten the watch band, and I am prepared for the next new watch, too."
"Great fit, perfect length!  I will be buying more of these!  After multiple washes, no fading.  I love these jeans!"
Awesome show
"Wow, this gotta be the most comfy bra I have ever wear, yes it is ultra lightweight!! I got 40C (38D also fits same) and fits perfectly from everywhere.  I haven't had any discomfort with the ribcage yet, so comfy and looks cute. Highly appreciate that there's no padding, which I don't need."
Great price. Great glamour.k
Wear them every day! The price was very reasonable.
Very nice quality! Looks exactly like the picture. Can't wait to use when I travel.
Just got it and it is beautiful!
Nice Bra. Fits me well and last a good amount of time. I think my last one lasted about a year.
"I love the jacket but I bought it in a 3x because I gain weight, but obvious not that much weight, because it was too big on me. But I am wearing it anyway because I just don't want to return it. 000000"
These are a huge hit at the company Christmas party. I bought them as a white elephant gift and they were great.
"I LOVE this backpack. Living in a small area we do not have storage room for multiple backpacks that do not fold down. A backpack like this is PERFECT! It folds down into a zipped pouch approximately 7 3/4"" wide x 6"" high x 1 1/2"" deep. Pouch becomes the top storage pocket when unfolded. Full size, this backpack is approximately 15 1/2"" high x 10"" wide x 5"" deep. Elasticated band on front of backpack allows you to tuck you coat/sweater in there and tighten it up for easy carrying.

A backpack this size is great for a short hike, going to the pool, kids day out etc. It is water-resistant and thus will keep your items dry in a rain shower. HOWEVER it is NOT waterproof so don't go try floating it down a river! You might find the results a little disappointing!

Product provided in exchange for an honest review. Thanks, Liz"
"Cute, luxurious, portable and clean. This bag is a great lil' backpack purse.
HOWEVER, doesn't fit my 12 inch laptop or much of anything else really, and it's heavy for such a small size.
NOT for college students; just trust me on that."
"My sister needed a new pair of shoes for walking and running.  Found these for cheap on amazon with free shipping.  She initially loved the sneakers but eventually complained about the weight when running.  Overall, great shoe for her walks, not so much for running.  However, she walks more than running.  Purchased in 2009...review better late than never."
"These are the best shoes I have owned in a long time. VERY comfortable and wear has been fantastic. I work in an office sitting in a cubicle most of my day, but still usually wear through 3-4 pairs of shoes a  year with either the sole wearing completely through or the back inside of the heel leather coming apart...but I have now had this pair of shoes for ~9 months and there is very little wear.

PROS: Very comfortable, little wear, leather still looks great, and I like to looks of shoe.

CONS: Really not much...only minor thing is one of the ""Un"" logo/tags came loose from stitching after about 7-8 months, but that is it.

I am definitely going to by another pair of these shoes someday, which is why I was looking at websites for any sales. Don't need for a while, but just want to make sure I get another pair of these shoes."
Way better quality than expected!
Great graficts people make a lot of coments on it.
"This top is sized well, fits comfortably. It is soft to the touch and snug (in a good way) when wearing it. Nothing hangs in the wrong places nor is anything too tight. Love this shirt!"
"I really like the shirt but if you're not into small shirts buy a size (maybe two) bigger than what you are.

I'm a L and can fit into M if I must.  the XL version of this shirt fit properly.

Other than that, 5-star shirt"
"I switched over to minimalist wallets about 2 years ago and will never go back to those big bulky bi/tri folds. This is now my second wallet of this type. The first was an expensive Ball and Puck that has served me well but I really wanted an RFID blocking wallet so I picked this one up for 1/4 the price.
 The quality seems good and I actually like the slanted pockets better than the other wallet I have which lacks this feature. If I have one complaint about this wallet it is that the pocket for money is just a tiny bit too shallow, causing the top edge of your money to stick out and get worn or wrinkled. It's pretty minor, but one of the things I like about this type of wallet is that my bills become nicely crisp after a few days. Like I said, pretty minor, but a small adjustment to the manufacturing of this wallet would make it perfect in my opinion.

 Otherwise, I highly recommend it!"
"Awesome pack highly recommend perfect for carrying you CCW when you don't have a belt on. the Nylon is not 1000 denier which i recommend for ops around the woods as thinner nylon wears and snags on branches and such.  this is perfect for urban carry which it was designed for.  it includes a holster and has an internal loop pactch to attach mag pouches etc,  knocked a star off cause it has lockable zippers but the way the zippers are set up it takes 3 luggage ;locks to lock it up when it could only need two locks."
Been buying Hanes for decades... because they last forever and always fit right! Don't trust too many companies with the goods down there!
I wished their was just t-shirts rather than the thermal tops
my girl loved her princess bag! it makes it easy to have a separate lunch bag. easy to clean. great buy
I didn't keep these because I found another shoe that was more of what  I was looking for (feminine sporty sandal) but these were very comfy right out of the box. I wear a small size (5) and these fit great compared to other shoes I tried. The toe box was not too big. The heel fit great with no rubbing. i would have kept these had I had the $$$. I can't vouch for how long they last or wear but I have had Merrell's in the past and they are good shoes.
FAST AND FIT.  FIVE STARS.
"Bought these on amazon in a 10 in mink and on another site in black in a 9.5, they pretty much fit the same. Heel height is super comfortable,  have worn them to work all day with no problems.  Liked them so much I bought them in 2 colors"
"I am really very happy with the quality and size of this surprisingly roomy purse! It has a number of pockets, they all zipper up,and the main inner pouch is able to hold a lot more than you'd expect (it fits a full size pineapple with room to spare...as a size comparison)."
It's so cute. My son and I both love it. Not to scary to wear to preschool
"Very nice piece of jewelry for my daughter, especially for the price. Would definitely recommend to purchase if looking for a gift for a little girl."
"My husband is pleased with these sweatpants.  The fit is just right and the color is as described.  A little thin compared to his last pair, but what isn't these days.  We would buy these from this seller again."
I love these more than the Levi's slight curve jeans but a little less than my slimming Sevens.
"It's a humid day. I'm wearing these sandals now. I was out doing chores,walking, riding, waiting in line and my feet are good, dry, and nicely balanced inside the sandals by 3 straps and dots arranged on the sole preventing my feet from sliding. I'm pleased b/c my sandals weren't flip flopping or sliding."
these are so sweet and very comfortable
"Gave these as a gift, they were highly enjoyed!! I love K. Bell socks, they are always well made. Definitely not gonna fall apart or fall down. The design is funny and cute and looks just as good in real life"
This is a great suit!!! Very figure flattering if you are curvy!! Lots of compliments on it. I got a XL and an XXL just to be safe. I did have to size up but that is because I have a larger chest otherwise the the XL would have been fine. I am 51 155lbs and a 34G chest.
a little stinky
"I used to wear Reebok all the time and had moved into other brands.  I just started a workout routine and needed a shoe that was comfortable and provided support.  I decided to go back to Reebok and these sneakers did not disappoint.  They provide great support, awesome gel insole and are super comfy.  My feet don't get fatigued as they had with other brands.  The color is a nice bright pink with silver accents.  I'd buy these again."
"Very nice, looks warm"
This is so cute.  It is as it appears in the photo.  Given as a baby gift so I can't speak to fit.  Well worth the price paid.
Needed to buy a bigger life vest for my father and this one fit perfect. Great quality product and great price
FAR AND AWAY EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS!!!
"Comfortable,durable, and great looking. If you need tactical pants or just around the office pants,this is def a great choice!"
So pretty.  Real glass beads (cobalt blue) catch the light.  I would buy in other colors as well.
great boxers. fit great and are very comfortable
"I didn't find this shirt as flattering as I had hoped. I typically look best in empire-waist styled shirts or shirts that are form-fitting through the bust and just under the bust. It is a very pretty shirt, but I thought it hid--rather than accentuated--my figure. The fabric has a sort of slinky feel to it, which is nice, and I like the lace. It probably would look very nice as a dressy top for a nice dinner or the like. I opted to return, but that was really my personal preference, and others may really enjoy this shirt."
"NOTE: The regular ""firm"" sole version was delivered, not the ""soft sole"" version listed.

I wear a medium width in men's dress shoes but the NARROW width suede Arizona is a good fit.  The suede straps stretch with wear so in a month or so I will need to punch holes in the straps to get a snugger fit.  Most women and many men will get their best fit with the NARROW  width.

Because I wear Birkenstocks five or six days a week, my feet are already well adjusted to the high and VERY firm arch support of the Arizona sandals.  The suede Arizonas felt good right out of the box.  However, if you are new to Birks, start with wearing just two hours a day and work up week by week. Wearing socks helps until the straps soften up.  When you get up to about  30 or 40 hours of wear per week, your feet will be well adjusted and you won't want to take them off.

Want to wear them for the next ten years?  Spray the suede with waterproofer and recoat the cork with cork sealer every month or two. Keep your Birks away from rain, water, and heat (don't leave in a parked car).  AND, replace the sole before wear reaches the cork layer.  You will get many years of comfortable wear."
It fits great! Love toms shoes!
"I was very happy when I opened the box and saw this purse.  It is large and carries all my stuff and I love the quilted puffy look.  The gold accents are cheap looking and unfortunately, I lost the zipper within the first week of using the purse.  I went to unzip the purse and the zipper fob was missing...I guess it wasn't attached very well to start with.  Overall I do like this purse but am concerned with its actual usage lifespan as I am very particular on how I handle my bags and it already has an issue."
"I love the Champion Jersey pant. They fit perfectly, wash well & are so light & comfortable. Thank you."
"These fit a little shorter than what I had envisioned, but they are super comfortable for wearing around the house."
"Second pair of these shoes.  Great price, fabulous fit!  Highly recommended."
"Great shoes, very comfortable for my wide feet.  I have both the brown and black, both go well with a suit - for daily office use, neither would work well for a formal dinner or event.  The shoes are a tight fit over the top for high arch orthotics, I had to opt for a thinner orthotic.  One reviewer commented that the inside of the shoe is like moleskin and grabs your socks.  I found that this made it ""feel"" as if the shoe was too short, but it was just that my socks were pulled tight over my toes - after a day or so that effect was not longer noticeable."
These are really great for easy slipping on and off. Cool variety pack!
made of good material/ fits well/ very cute suit
Nice pants thanks
"Beautiful Watch, great price and keeps perfect time.  It is fashionable and I've had several nice comments about it."
"Use them for work, and now that its snowing they are very good and fit great"
"This bag is perfect for the guy that wants something smaller than a back-pack but larger than a ""Murse"" (man-purse).
It's approximately a foot in height, but has so many hidden pockets all around it, that it carries a lot in a very condensed space. (6 pockets of varying size).
It's large enough to fit standard size books, pens, note books.. Etc, but I would NOT recommend it for a standard 15' laptop. iPad, notebooks, etc fit just fine with room to spare.
Personally, I like this pack.. Great for getting around city, light hiking, or plane travel."
"Looks pretty, quick shipping. The chain is the only draw back. It seems a little weak."
greally great to have 2.  one for home and the other to keep in my gym bag.  or give to someone else. made good and sturdy.  fast delivery too
"FIT
If you're looking for a turtleneck that fits tightly around the neck, this isn't it.

If you have a belly, this will accentuate it since it is tight in the mid-section.

I'm normally a Large or XL. I would need an XXL for this to fit.

QUALITY
Excellent. Thick fabric, high quality, looks classy, seams and stitching are well done."
"Very comfortable, I wish they would have in different  colors. I love these. True to size."
"Super Cute !! , would buy these slippers again... And I'd pay more for them if they had a thicker sole."
"A very good but"" love mine""!!"
"My daughter is on the rhythmic gymnastics preteam and I got this to use for her future leotards.  While I haven't put them on any leotards yet, I have put them on just about everything else including her half shoes, hoop bag, ponies etc.  The Hotfix Swarovski crystals are super easy to use with the BeJeweler Pro.  Love it!"
"These were for a show.  Many dancers like them, both male and female."
this is one of the cutest dresses ever. i got it for my daughter and she absolutly loved it.
LOVE LOVE LOVE! CUTIEST AND BEST PAIR OF RAIN BOOTS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!
I bought the navy colorway and it's lovely! I went to Target and a lady driving by in the parking lot stopped and asked where I bought it. Very flattering for all figures.
Bought a 3x for my husband who normally wears a 2x and it fits great. I recommend sizing up unless you want it snug. Nice shirt.
"These are a must along with the Wet Look gloves,  My wife wears these to shop.  and always finds great deals.  Perhaps I should worry?"
Very comfortable dress nice
"Great for the price. Grampy loves it, and wears it all the time. A classic."
"I have slender calves (13.75"") and it has been very difficult over the years to find good fitting boots but these boots are perfect! There is still room to fit a pair of thick, cozy boot socks. My inseam is about 33"" and the shaft ends just under my kneecap. The leather is gorgeous and I have no complaints regarding the quality. They will take a few wearings to break in, but I can tell that these boots will last years."
Very cute purse. Well made.
Great sock so far... they stay on and they are true to size.  I will buy other colors.
"Nice shirt gave it to my son, for a slim body"
I'm a teacher and I stand all day long.  I wore the socks with my Converse and they worked great for most of the day.  I did not start to feel a shift of them being lowered on my feet until dismissal.  I wear a women's size 8 and they fit just fine.
Great shoes! However the strap is so tight on my daughter she can't stand to wear them!  It cuts into her foot.
"I ordered this corset according to the sizing guidelines provided and - just to be on the safe side - ordered it one size smaller.  Wrong on both counts!  I honestly don't understand what people are saying when they claim this corset is too small or true to size. If you want to wear your corset like a shirt, close-fitting but not at all snug, and you want there to be little or no gap between laces in the back, go ahead and order according to the size chart.

This is a cute corset and a great value for the money.  I wish I had ordered it 2 sizes smaller! I don't think it will hold up well to heavy lacing but if you want to be cinched in a bit you should consider ordering a few inches smaller than your waist size.

I'm bummed I couldn't keep it."
"Nice, but take it out of the box because it has a smell from the black part of it or wipe it down with mild soap on a wash cloth until the smell is gone."
I like them quite well. They are light weight and fit me perfectly.
love that I can change out the watch band.  its very practical and looks great on my small wrist. The additional bands are extremely affordable too making it fashionable at a great price.
"I ordered the Espresso/Walnut sandle, but received the black instead.  I put it on and fell in love with it.  Looks great on your feet and feels oh so good.  Nice dressy addition to crocs.  I actually kept the black pair and ordered the espresso/walnut additionally."
"These fit true to size. We have ordered these twice. Theyre comfortable and even with the bottom on them, u could go outside with them easily."
god price and good quality
these shoes are the 5th or maybe even 6th pair of these shoes that I have owned. I like these shoes because they are extra wide and they have memory foam in them that seems to bounce back for ages. I can almost get through an entire year before replacing them and I am tough on my shoes.
Well made and my wife loved it as a Christmas gift. Looks like it should cost quite a bit more.
"This is such a soft, luxurious, smart-looking scarf. I gave several as gifts, & was very impressed & pleased with quality, color, & affordability! Would definitely buy again!!!"
"These bags are of a really good quality. This is my 2nd and 3rd purchases for the Maxpedition's products. I am very satisfied with them. I use them for netbook carrying bags, with all the extras for each of them...You cant go wrong with this bags."
Smaller than it seems in the picture. Still really like it. Matches my aesthetic well.
"I bought these as ad on's so I could get free shipping, and was so pleasantly surprised, I thought they would be cheesey faux leather but are in fact hard durable plastic, and a great value!"
"One of my best, I love them. I'm going to have a very good time wearing my boots. So happy."
This is the second item that I have purchased from Coolibar.  I am as pleased with the Swim Skort as I was with their Cabana Hoodie.  Excellent quality with just the right amount of stretch.  I also love the short underneath...very comfortable.  This is an easy option to pop on over my bathing suit when I want to have a little more coverage. I wear a size 8-10 and ordered the medium and it fit perfectly.  I will be ordering more items from Coolibar.
My husband is happy with them. The color great and material fresh
quite confortable but probably in Tsubo my correct size is 6.5
She Loved them!
"Silky, light weight, with a lovely pattern."
My husband loves it. Its warm and he always has it on. Great buy
Yellow...
"Adidas' Neo brand is their budget line I believe, so I didn't have high expectations for these shoes. Just wanted something to wear one day a week and look good. Well they turned out to be really comfortable. So far I'm trying to find more excuses to wear them, and they still look great!

I always buy 8.5 in Adidas, that's what I bought, and they fit great."
Comfy and fits great.  Cute for the 4th of July.  I would recommend this product.
They are great.  Changing all my tags out for these
"Great quality! Thicker material, which is nice so it's not see through, being white."
"Beautiful, thru to fit, color looks better tha the picture"
"All day comfort, true to size.. and unbelievably gorgeous !"
Great product! Fits perfect!
"I like the shape but needs half size up . I would give to my nice and would maybe order one half size up. Thanks
Recommend this shoes, consider half size up."
"I love these onesies, but it said I would get ""I think my dad is superman"", but it says ""hero in training"". Still cute, but not what I thought I was getting."
"SPA QUALITY, SPA SOFT, SPA SPECIAL."
Amazing buy!!! Husband LOVES it!!
So nice and soft
The drawstring jogger pants are so comfortable. I can dress up or down and outfit in them. They look cool in pumps or sneakers. I love these pants! If I had the money I would order every color you have.
Pretty good-looking and it swings gently on the ear.  Shipped well.
Perfect for nursing- fabric is soft. The length isn't too long but just long enough that postpartum fits right covering my belly. I also like the adjustable straps
"Amazing, especially considering the price.  My son wears a 10 and this fits him like a custom, modern suit jacket.  It looks like a much more expensive jacket.  Sometimes kids suit jackets look big and bulky, but this one has a modern fit."
"This is an amazing watch, and literately is a conversation piece. I red this in one of the reviews, and it is so true. The quality is beyond great for the price, and quality is very important to me. I am a woman, that likes big face watches/men watches, and it works for me. It reduces having to wear more jewelery, and that is rare for me. It is fashionable,and cool at the same time. I highly, highly, recommend this watch for anyone."
Love Asics! These also are a little metallic/shiny and very cute in person!
"Everything was perfect, the costume had all of the pieces fit perfectly and it was shipped quickly!  I am completely satisfied with my purchase."
"I bought this cute backpack, not for my grandchild, but for myself.  (Although I am sure once she sees it, she'd love it, and I will give it to her, only to buy another one for myself) I plan to put this monkey on my back when I take walks to the beach. I can put my keys, cell phone, water, and everything else I need, so I can walk hands free."
"Do not listen to the reviews that say order larger sizes because they run small... I did that and they were too big, the size 6 would've been just fine"
"Not much to say about this product. It's a wallet with a chain on it. It holds money, and stays connected to your belt. It did what it was meant to do."
Excellent fit and quality. A great shirt for everyday or sleep shirt. Washes well; I usually hang it to dry.
This is my favorite sports bra but need reinforcement in the back closure area.  If you get i tight enough to fit right the hooks want to pull out and don't bother asking Moving Comfort for help.  The won't back their products.  I have purchased 6 and all have pull out but i still buy them because they have the most support.
Great price. Nice shirt
"I got this mattress pad for my niece, who has moved into a medical facility and needed something comfortable for her back. She says she has been sleeping like a baby on a cloud! What a great product. Her father sleeps on one, also, so he suggested it in the first place. Thanks!"
"These pajamas were really pretty and soft, but they run very large.  The waist band on the small is around 31"", so if you are small-framed these probably won't work for you after delivery.  I loved them, but sent them back since I was looking for something to wear post-delivery and through the nursing phase. I believe the owner is working on an x-small - if that happens it will probably solve that problem."
"The color is great on the swim trunks, the only thing missing is some sort of lining. Trunks dry fast and fit as expected and I like the front draw strings to tighten to the perfect fit"
Perfect ring and does not scratch!
"The item was a good weight and cute as can be,but it is sized on the small side.  I bought another one piece of the same size and this item is much smaller.  More like newborn."
"Run a size smaller but being made of canvas they stretch a little, seems to be a good shoe though"
Fit well.  I wear it for golfing!
Nice camo pants for everyday use.... Great for working around the yard... great for outdoor activities and paintball.
Love love this belt .I got it for my jumper and got lots of compliments.
Hanes is a reliable manufacturer and I am happy with the purchase. The shirt has been washed several times and there has been no fading.
The scarf is cute and not too bulky and the material is very soft.  Looks great with a black fitted dress or even a fitted black long sleeve with jeans!
"This mask is made of thick, sturdy feeling plastic. I used a stencil mad out of painters tape and put a diamond pattern on it with plastic-bonding paint and it came out perfectly.  Exactly what I was looking for!"
I like them but can not walk in flip flops all day.  They are very comfortable!
"Short review....I like it.  It's super thin, yet holds driver's license, health insurance card, 2 credit cards, Costco membership, and some cash like a champ.  I wasn't planning on using the cash area, and just use a money clip.  But after using it for a couple days, the cash sits in there well."
"Somewhat short in the torso. Otherwise it's good. I have a very long torso and large breasts - so it could be me, but i'm used to this brand having a slightly longer torso in most shirts - so I was a bit surprised."
very useful with a diaper on it.
"Carhartt Sweatshirts.....midweight or heavyweight are the best wearing sweatshirts available on the market today.....my partner wears the heavyweight ones in winter and midweight ones in the cool spring and fall....they wear, wash, and have a long life, and have a great price on Amazon.com.  Thanks Carhartt for another great product."
my neiece loves this necklace. its very cute n easy to match with her outfits. thank you for the awsomeness!
"I resisted buying Tevas because I don't really like open toed sandals. And then I found these. They are awesome. They wear like a sneaker, but are much more comfortable. Whenever this pair wears out, I will buy another pair. Took them camping and hiking, and my feet never felt so great."
Great shaper. Arrived on time.
Great array of colors. Stones are a nice quality and sparkle. Nice size to wear if you have multiple piercing's.
"Perfection! I love it. I have a round face so this shape looked perfect on me. I also have dark hair and eyes so the brown was a good touch with the light blue- very pretty! my second pair of tiffany sunglasses and i love them.

I get many compliments on the blue accent color =)"
I write this probably two years after I purchased this watchband. Fits perfectly on the watch that I use daily. No signs that it is getting weaker or wearing.
The shirt was very good quality. And looks real good. every time I wear it I get asked where did l get it.
This is not costume material! It is more like regular clothing. It's machine washable!! Need I say more??? LOVE IT!!! Can not recommend enough! My daughter cannot tolerate anything scratchy and costumes always make her miserable. Not this one! Soft and beautiful! Wish I had found Little Adventures years ago!!
I love these short panties no rise
"They are small, but they are very cute!"
"Great undies for toddlers. Fit true to size chart, shrink just enough when washed. Very soft cotton, not too tight. My daughter loves them!"
Boyfriend absolutely loves this outfit on me.
"It is hard for me to find sandals that don't exaggerate my wide feet (size D) - my little toes often hang outside of the sandals, which is not a pretty sight.  I was actually happy to hear from many other reviewers complaint about the wider width of the sandals.  I quickly bought two pairs based on my normal size, and they fit perfectly."
"I ordered an XL. Almost seemed like a kids XL. It fit, but very snug. Comfy. Am afraid to put in dryer for fear it may shrink."
Perfect as expected.  A beautiful watch.
"Love these, perfect fit"
"Were always looking for a good khaki pant for the boys for casual dress. Stick khakis and a nice dress shirt on the boys and they look super sharp.

The Wrangler pants are nice cotton khakis with a touch of spandex to give them give which makes them fit better and look better.

The fit is slim and straight. The sides of the waists are adjustable.

They have washed well and are holding up well."
I usually take a medium and this fits as expected.
"4.5 stars
The color is a little more faded than in the image, but not in a bad way. It looks like a deliberate sort of weathered look. The fabric has a nice thickness to it, though it is a bit rougher than I'd like, but the weave is dense enough to look like it will last through many washes and uses. One thing I would have liked was a longer length. In the picture, it looks a bit longer than in person, unless the model has a short torso (which I doubt). Great sleeve design! The versatility is great and looks cool!"
"Wow what great service! I ordered two shirts for my daughters :""Sadie's"" dance. Not only did I get it quick I also got a Bonus! These shirts are well made and they look good on! I am amazed and totally satisfied!  -very appreciative mom"
"I LOVE THESE EARRINGS!!!!! What's not to love about subtle & lovely kitty stud earrings!?
These are gorgeous earrings, too! The shine on these stones is really incredible and they feel quite high quality. Sturdy, a bit of heft, just enough to know they won't snap in half. And they are just the right size... not big & droopy. Just perfect! (Or purrrr-fect!! Hahah!!)
I love that they are so subtle too. You could easily wear them with a classy outfit. Most people won't notice right away that they're cats, but they're so pretty & cute. They look nicer than the pic here shows too.
If you love cats & shiny stud earrings, you're going to want to get these. I highly recommend!"
Loved these earrings! Metal is substantial along with the post (won't bend out of shape). Perfect size. They just fall slightly below the lobe/at the lobe. Option to twist the position to have it sit higher up for those that want it not to fall at the lobe. Also can be worn in second piercing on lobe and doesn't crowd the other earring. Catch the light wonderfully... Now too much hammering so it won't go with other plain gold pieces...  but enough hammering to match other hammered baubles. This is going to be one of your go to pieces just like diamond studs are.  Read that some folks didn't like the backs that came with them. I had no issue. They are quite secure and keep the earrings positioned well. Also came in large unmarked jewelry box that was more than I expected for these inexpensive gems!
Nothing ugly about this sweater.  It's super cute!
"Very soft! Iamvery pleased with this fleece! Price is great. Fits good, not tight though if someone is looking for that, but I didn't look for a tight one"
Great looking jacket for the price! It does smell a bit so you'll need to let it air out. It has a light padded lining so it is warm too.
"I found these to be true to size - I wear a women's 8.5 in Asics and ordered these in a size 7. The fit was as expected - not too large and not too small. The Amazon fitting guide suggested that I go with 7.5, but I found the 7 to be a better fit.

Other than that I was not a huge fan of these and ended up returning them. They felt quite stiff, did not offer any arch support and I was not a huge fan of the way they look: the white sole part is quite thick, and the black on black Asics logo did not look as nice as I had hoped.

If you are in search of a comfortable casual walking shoe, I'd recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Onitsuka-Tiger-Ultimate-81-Running-Shoe-Black-Monaco-Blue-7-M-US/dp/B00PUQ84HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Onitsuka Tiger Ultimate 81 Running Shoe, Black/Monaco Blue, 7 M US</a>&nbsp;instead of these - the Ultimate 81 are very comfortable and much more attractive in real life than the Temp Racers."
Great cut & fit and very comfy material.
Nice Quality and color.  Will buy again in a different color.
"Sometimes a lighter weight but still roomy handbag, such as this one, is nice."
I love this hat! I will most likely get this in other colors.
"I really like these sandals.  They are very pretty and line up with Crocs standard of well built shoes.  That said, they are a bit snug.  I have worn a 10M (US) for decades, but these are very tight across the tops of my feet.  It's a little bit disappointing.  I'm keeping them in hopes that with some wear, the material will give a little bit and I can wear them more often."
"Pros/reasons for buying
1. Needed a casual but formal black blouse
2. Wanted a simple but modern style, the opaque style really is perfect
3. Fits well, style is meant to be longer on back.. I sometimes tuck it in with tight jeans
4. Great price! I browsed a while on Amazon for a quality button up for a low price and this is it!"
Pretty shoes but too wide for my foot
"Great quality. I have a big head, so it ran somewhat small (even at the largest increment I think?) but the hat is REALLY cute and looks really nice despite cheap price. No color rubbing off either, really nice and will buy from this place again."
"These socks are super cute! My only qualm is that I purchased the 0-12 month size for my almost 8 month old, and they are a tiny bit too small already. She is by no means a big baby, so it was somewhat surprising to see them fit a little small for her. However, they fit well enough and get lots of comments whenever we go out!"
Very comfortable. I bought my normal size and they fit but very loose.
These were a fair price for boys shoes. They are high quality and my son says they are very comfortable
Love microfiber clothes soft & very comfy
My daughter is a huge Hello Kitty fan. This set was the perfect gift for her. She loves the silky feel and often wears this set as pajamas. Cuddl Duds is a great product. I have bought everyone in our family a set of Cuddl Duds for the cold winter months.
Great sneaker! Still looks like a brand new shoe after about a year!
"Dog lovers - this is the sandal for you.  I'm a flip flop lover and over the last three years, I've had two puppies.  And out of a dozen pairs of flip flops during this time, these are the ONLY flip flops still somewhat alive.  The rest of been chewed useless.  It's not like my dogs haven't tried though, as you can see from the pic.  It may actually be time to finally buy a new pair though.
Why four stars?  Because these flops are like walking on bricks.  The sole is far too hard.  No cushioning at all.  They do offer good support though."
Great but somewhat tight in the chest.  Could be a bit looser.  Love the blue color!!!!
"Gorgeous bracelet! It's very well made and the rose gold leather straps are beautiful.  I like that the face screws on.  I bought this as a wedding gift and put the bride's and groom's birthstones inside, along with a little red crystal heart charm. It was a hit!"
"Nice shirt, cute details, but small. Size up."
I love these! Very comfortable and cute.  I would order again!
"great fit, durable jeans"
"The person i bought it for, loved it! Excellent quality."
Gifts for my son. They are very confortable and he loves them.
"Has a pretty strong, plastic smell fresh out of the box. The strings are really cheap and are attached cheaply, but overall, good quality for the price."
"Could not live without these belts! I own 4 of them!
The really don't show through clothing."
Sturdy well made shoe.
I love these shoes. They are comfortable to wear all day. The color is lovely. I received many compliments from the moment I arrived at work until I left to go home.
"I love it! I tried other wayfarer before and all sat on my cheekbones. i didn't know ray-ban made ""NEW"" classic until i tried another pair in sunglass hut. I picked one of these bad boys to show my friend that wayfarer doesn't fit small faces. But to my surprise, it fit just right. I was so confused. It looked so good that i bought it right there and then. I love it!"
Love these sneakers.  Been wearing them for a couple years.  Getting hard to find them since they are an older style.
Cute shoes.  Received so many compliments on them.  Bought a pair for my daughter.  She wore them so much she wore them out and I had to purchase a second pair for her  Bought my daughter-in-law a pair in another color.  She loves them also.
"Great buy.  I bought it in Navy and the color is exactly as shown in the picture.  It looks like an expensive piece of luggage.  Very light weight.  Love the yellow pinstripe on the edge.  Also, very roomy.  I don't know how it would look in other color options but Navy looks great and smart.  I am going to buy one for my mom as well.  Great price."
I love them but they are definitely too small.  I am a 9 1/2 and I purchased a nine because of some of the reviews had stated to buy one size lower.  I have purchased one size up I did not receive them yet.
"I love these shoes.  They are darling - and I wear a size 10.  I bought a single wide.  In Clark's, that is often enough for me, though I usually wear a double wide in other shoes.  These were a bit snug -not terrible, but more than other Clark's have been.  I bit of shoe stretch and a stretcher and they were just fine.  I'd absolutely buy these again in another color - if they still were available!"
"Omg! Game changer! This is perfect, wish I would have had it sooner! Fits great, am a 34-36H!"
"The shoes are really nice.  A bit narrow, I did have narrow feet,  but I have bunions, which make my feet wider than they would be regularly.  Some might find them still narrow.  The shoes do supply good support, so I was able to wear them walking about for an afternoon out.  They look nice with shorts, skirt, summer dress, and jeans.  I'm not crazy about the oval metal piece, it is attractive enough, but not a big metal fan and wished it wasn't quite so prominent.  I had looked everywhere for sandals that provide support, good looks, and stay firmly to my feet when walking and these fit the bill."
Thick and warm / great for cold halloweens!  Stretchy and fit well!
"love love love these pants, fit is perfect , material is great.. very happy and I am a big woman who has a hard time finding clothes that fit,, love these pants."
Love these dresses! Found them at the beach and use them as night gowns. Very sheer and comfortable.
The leggings are nice and good quality. I received on time for a children's play. I would definitely recommend this product.
Nice and  small ! Love  the length of necklace !  Don't have to worry about any tarnishing because its TITANIUM
"This is just what you would expect from Carhartt, it's well made and heavy, perfect for someone who works outdoors or is generally out doors a lot, its warm and fits well."
This is a striking purse with plenty of carry options. It's well crafted with lots of room and pockets.
"A little bit can be considered small, if you're a pretty gifted man ! But works fine during harsh activities, by keeping everything in the right position !"
"I'm a size 4, but the cotton is not very stretchy and is very tight around the calves, and my calves aren't very big. definitely a under layer product"
They look fine.  I also think you get what you pay for
I bought these for my 5 year old for Christmas and he is going to love them!  I can't comment on the sizing and fit because he hasn't tried them on yet but they are definitely not cheap.  They are pretty big slippers.  The price seemed a little high but another online retailer was out of stock so I had to suck it up.  I would buy these again.
"These sandals are just a little bit long in the footbed and a little bit wide, but I'd still consider them to be pretty true to size, as they aren't a whole size larger up, maybe 1/4 size larger. I wear an 8.5 and these are 8.5. They are comfortable and look really stylish. I could probably wear them all day - I just hope the straps don't break like some of the reviews claim. I will update if the straps break. Other than the fact that they are slightly large, they are almost perfect, even though the price was high at $30."
"These shoes are simply amazing, I am so happy that I bought them.  So comfortable, very classic shoe sold at an amazing price, what took me so long to buy my first pair of Wing Tips.  The photo underplays just how good they look and feel in person, two thumbs for these shoes.....way up."
"Unlike other reviewers, I was disappointed these didn't feel like heaven out of the box.  I have a wide, size 7 foot and am familiar with Earth's fit, so ordered my true size, which I wear in their sandals.  The boots were beautiful with soft leather, and a nice lining.  However, they rubbed my little toes, uncomfortably, and I debated keeping them... but I had a hunch, and took a huge gamble when I left for a 7 day business trip in Las Vegas with these as my only dress shoes. Everyday, there was this uncomfortable rub when I put the boots on, but this disappeared quickly, and I'm now debating 2 more pairs of these.  After 12+ hours, my feet and back were happy & pain free, and I even wore them in my hotel room.  I wish they were a little wider to begin with, but they stretch nicely, flatter my ""athletic"" calves, and really are a great boot.
12-23-2013:  The follow up:  I broke down and bought the ankle version of these in pewter.  These feel a little wider in the toe box, with less rub initially.  I really love these boots!"
Decent work boots.
Nice and comfortable shoes! In love with my shoes. It did bother on my toes the first time. I order 71/2 what I usually order on open shoes but maybe maybe 7 would fit perfect because I don't like to see the space on the back. Maybe I will get a pad the help fill the space. But other than that I'm happy. Not high at all or at least I don't feel they are high because of the comfortable the shoes are.
Love these shoes ..ready to another pair ! Happy feet !
"I have a 34"" waist and the size large fit perfectly.  They feel comfortable and with two front pockets and one large Velcro pocket on the outside of each leg and one medium Velcro pocket in the back, I can comfortably carry my cell phone, wallet and keys with room to spare."
Fit great and was very comfortable.
It fit her just as she expected it to and she felt very sexy in it.
I love this shirt so much!!!
"Love the sweater but in my opinion it runs slightly small.  I'm 5'8 / 190 and purchased the Large which is fine because I only wear T-Shirts under most of my cotton sweaters.  If you're the conservative, corporate type who chooses to wear collared dress shirts under their mock sweaters I would go up a size.  Definitely worth the $25 price!"
Arrived 6 days earlier than expected and it is absolutely the cutest little jewelry holder.  It looks great in my closet right next to my clutch collection.  I keep all of my most commonly worn jewelry on this stand.  Love it!!!
So far cute but I had go up a size. In all the Cobb hills I have tried even ones with heels I was 10w but these in 10w were too short.  Glad I ordered the size 11 at same time because those fit perfect. Where other Cobb hill size 11 was huge on me. I got them in almond and I just ordered them in black.
Just as described. This is a nice sturdy bag and light weight.
Absolutely beautiful.  Just as pictured.  A beautiful colored stone and very well made.  I purchased the matching earrings and ring also and I am very pleased with all of them.
"A little long for my 5'2'' frame with heels, but since it was so cheap I took it to a tailor and got it hemmed a little. The hood won't stay on without bobby pins. Great for the price though!"
"Very good i am 5'11' i buy L, and fit me perfect"
Looks real!!
"These shoes fit great the first time I put them on and continue to feel very comfortable.  Their soft cushioned foot pad is just heavenly on my feet.  OK so I know they are not the most stylish shoe out there but I really don't care - for running to the store  or chores they are perfect. I ordered a wide so I could wear them with sweat socks comfortably, but the heel is a little lose when I wear them with knee-high hose.  Nevertheless they are just what I was expecting and just what I needed for everyday wear.  I save the high style stuff for going out."
Pretty good looking jacket. Normal jacket for normal wear. I thought it would be a little more classy. But it does the job
"I bought this with apprehension due to not being able to touch and see it in person.  I didn't want the hassle of going to a Halloween/costume store either.  So, I saw this and was pleasantly surprised!  Nice fit and curls wear not crushed as I expected.  It's a pretty red/auburn which is nice.  I'm not disappointed with this purchase!"
Exactly as expected
"I think these Wolverines will keep your yoes warm down to -30*. Easy . Highly recommend because they're also comfortable inside and out , I never noticed the difference."
Many people at the wedding we attended commented on how adorable our 4 year old looked in this. He didn't complain even once about it so it must have fit well.
Hot damn!!!!!
"I am a 34D and often have difficulty finding a bra that provides adequate support and comfort at the same time. I have spent all kinds of money experimenting with different styles and brands only to be disappointed. This bra provides both comfort and support, and it looks good as well. I can run, do aerobics and kickboxing, or just wear it for everyday use. I would prefer a little more support for some of the exercises I do that include a lot of jumping, however I am still happy with it. Ultimately, it has become my favorite. I have washed it several times and put it through the dryer and its still held its shape well. Although, I have started air drying it to make it last longer."
Great fit and style. Works well with rain (as expected) and it a nice light jacket for cooler weather or wind. I have worn it several times during the early spring in Colorado and have not been disappointed. It is a nice looking jacket and I get a lot of compliments on it as well.
"Been using for a little less than a year and still looks great. The only wear I can see is a little leather wearing off at the corners, but that's to be expected. I love the minimalistic style and it's super well built. I may buy another when this one wears out."
"My daughter had to have these. She wore them everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Unfortunately the bottom of them are cloth and in no time at all there were holes all over the bottoms. Would be better with a rubber bottom."
"A nice boot, I have only had an opportunity to wear it once but it fits well and seems well made."
Perfect for the winter! My daughter likes to still wear her uniform skorts and dresses. These are absolutely wonderful to keep her legs warm with socks and boots.
"This shirt is amazing. For ten bucks I got a shirt that appears to have cost at least 40 or 50 dollars. I'm not exaggerating, this shirt is a quality item. I wear this type of uniform shirt on my job, and to be able to save money and at the same time get something this good is like hitting the number for me. A ""win"" ""win"" situation. The shirts I have been buying that were made by another popular uniform manufacturer cost me thirty five bucks each. These are better in both quality and in price"
Very nice bathrobes however I do find them a little heavy in the summertime.you will not be cold in these bathrobes and they are very soft
So pretty in person! It's a Christmas present for my daughter so I don't know how well it will hold up but she's going to love how pretty it is!
"These are the most comfortable and rugged boot I have ever owned. I haven't owned them long enough to say how they will hold up, but I can say they suit my needs for just about all my activities, and they are warm but would hardly call them just a winter boot. They are so much more."
Nice ring but runs a little small. Fit like. 6 1/2 instead of 7
"The quality is fantastic (as I have now come to expect from the brand), and the colours are pretty though a little darker than the picture. The bag is HUGE, a bit bigger than i expected but i was pleased with that."
Cute and durable for a potty training toddler! The fit is as expected and they have held up very well to numerous wears and washing. I'd say they are a tad on the small side; more of 2T than 3T fit but they still fit well. Colorful and soft and my son likes the Thomas designs.
I love these capri leggings. I already have them in two other colors.
"Ppl love it everywhere I go. It is like tissue tee material. It is very long in length, true to size. Good quality, didn't twist when washed."
"This review is for the Zoozie LA Women's Lace Dress with Crochet Details Mini and Maxi Dresses.

This Zoozie black tunic/dress with lace detail is so cute! I was a little worried at first this wouldnt fit me  I am a size 12 and the dress is a LARGE. I usually wear an xlarge in clothing  but I actually own another dress from Zoozie and it ran a little large, so I thought I would give it a go. I am so glad I did because the dress fits really well and its flattering. It is not loose on me  but it is sort of fitted. The style lends itself to a being a little tighter  so I am actually really glad I got the large and its so perfect!

The material on this is fairly thin  so I wear a black strapless cami under it. I got the black color so the cami matches. This top is definitely for the warmer weather. It doesnt really look good with a cardigan  and like I said the material is thin  so I wear it out when its hot. It is also very casual. I would not wear this out to a date, party or somewhere else that required a little more formal of attire. The fabric is ultra soft though and its perfect for spending a summer day out shopping, drinking coffee or walking along the beach. The seams are all finished with precision  there are no loose threads or areas that look like they are threatening to tear. The bottom of the dress is double stitched. The fabric says 95% rayon, 5% spandex. I absolutely LOVE rayon because its natural, it washes well, and it doesnt really ever look wrinkled. When I received this dress  I threw it on the sofa for a day because I didn't have time to try it on- and when I finally tried it on  it looked fairly smooth (no wrinkles). You could quickly run a streamer over it before wear, but I really don't think thats necessary. It also says you are able to iron on the tag.

The tunic washes up perfectly; I just run it though the cold cycle on my machine and then hang dry. The fabric does not fade and it comes out looking like new. The lace detail is white against the black. I wish the company offered a black against black. The lace is cute though, but only single stitched into the top of the neckline. I was almost thinking about running another stitch over it just to be sure in the future it doesnt break away. Overall though, for the price and the quality, this is a great top! 4/5 stars

If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review."
"Love this thermal underwear.  The material is very soft and comfortable.  I have not yet worn it in very cold weather yet, but it feels like it will be nice and cozy and warm.  I only wish it came in white, too.  I ordered the black."
Great shoe Real leather not like last pair I bought from Amazon. Last pair were KaySwiss. Watch out check inside tag if you buy k swiss.
"Love the necklace!
Good quality and metal doesn't irritate my skin."
Very good cap
These are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.  The arch support could be slightly better but I'm just happy that they carried a wide size.  More colors please Clarks!
These are simple and clean.  They don't really impress me as much as some Amazon Collection jewelry has but they're still nice enough.  The pictures capture them well.
The colors are bright and clear and matched the picture exactly.  This scarf is so very soft! I can't wait for colder weather to be able to wear this.
Nice sleeping shorts.
I was surprised at how comfortable these shoes are!!  And the heel is exactly what I was looking for!
"Very heavy anchor. Good quality leather necklace. it's too big for what I was intending to use it for; but, it is a very well constructed product. I am 5'6"" tall 142 pounds. I wanted to wear it as a necklace. It is too large and too heavy for me. It would be great for a guy say 5'11"" or taller.....150+ pounds to wear as a necklace."
"i said they fit somewhat small, but not in the waist or the length of the legs.  it's the mesh jock strap/sewn-in underwear that is incredibly uncomfortable.
I'm 6'5"" ,290lbs.
the mesh is sewn too high.  i don't know if this would be an issue for a shorter guy, say under 6ft or not.
the elastic cuts into my thighs/crotch area and almost hurts after 4-5 minutes wearing them.
so i cut the mesh out.  and they are SUPER comfortable now.  the fabric is silky.  not like basketball shorts or the silk sewn on the end of a blanket, but more like... real silk.  very soft.  i bought a second pair, cut the mesh out and wear them around the house as like ""lounge"" shorts.
the thigh pockets are deep but the ""regular"" pocket are not.  i can only get 3 of my 4 fingers in there and even then only to the 2nd knuckle."
"I've only used this on one pair of boots, but so far it seems to have worked quite well.  Definitely made a better repair than Shoe Goo, and it dried faster/was a bit stickier & easier to use than Locktite Polyurethane glue, with what appears to be a similar grade repair to the latter."
"A BIT LOOSE IN THE HEEL, BUT, EASILY REMEDIED; COMFORTABLE"
"Normally wear 10.5-11, So I ordered a 44.  Was nearly an inch/2cm too long.  Will exchange.  My first time ordering Vibrams...  Am concerned about getting my toes in there, so I ordered some ""toe splitters"".
Will update..."
Love the shoes are so comfortable
"Totally awesome fanny pack!!! Great colors, good quality, nice zippered compartments. Love it :) would recommend to anyone needing a slamming fanny pack"
"The majority of the reviews state to purchase a size smaller and I agree.  I first purchased a size 8 but had to return and order a 7.5.  I'm going to use these boots are for motorcycle riding but they're very comfortable.  I really like them and think they are a great product.  Most importantly, they are made in the USA."
"They are not meant to provide good arch support =) they are great, I can sashay with ease! Will definitely order another pair once these have been danced away!"
"I already rated this, Amazon.  It's fine, but the material sheds like a cat."
"This was for my daughters cosplay. she says they're perfect for the outfit. They're big on her skinny legs, but do what she wanted."
"These jeans fit amazing on a 50 plus woman.  I love the stretch, not too much and they look great."
"Great official dockers. fits exactly as expected, high quality, came on time"
"I LOVE THESE PANTS!!! The fabric is amazing, the fit is incredible. I could not complain at all. The design is also fantastic, I get compliments all of the time."
"I have bunionettes :( lol these are soooo comfy and they fit perfectly.  I can see how they would fit loosely if you wear a half size but sized up and had normal feet.  But I don't... boohoo.... and so when I see a pair of shoes that fit wonderfully and hide the imperfections hahaha I grab em.  I have these in black and now I have them in red.  Beautiful red color, btw.  Blood red/ Ox blood color.  I guess I bought the last pair because I no long can view them on here.  If you are looking for a red pair of these, check out ASOS.  They have them but the stock is low.  :)  I love these shoes, I can run in them and chase after my kiddos.  They could be uncomfortable if you're not used to being in heels but the hidden platform will help with the adjustment.  I used to wear heels all day everyday ranging from 3-5"" high.  Not practical now that I have kids.  These shoes are perfect in heel height."
This ring looks great alongside genuine white gold and diamond rings as well as other white gold plated CZ rings.
"This is a good watch for our hot summers in the South. I thought the tan in the band might be too much as I wanted a white band. But when it came, I saw that the tan is very light and doesn't stand out Nice watch for the price. Great for casual, all day wear. The face is a good size. Not big but easy to read. Very happy that I bought it!"
I am never sure on sizes so I went to a local place at the mall and tried on a different kind of Sperry to find I fit a 12W. So I ordered the 12EE and they couldn't fit more true to size. Most comfortable boat shoes to wear barefoot and they seem well made!
It's a lovely bag. The size is nice and big. Would definitely recommend.
"This shirt is fantastic. It is an Asian type sizing which they clearly make aware in the description so it fits snug, but that is the best part. Dress shirts on the market today usually fit like a parachute and get bigger in the midsection so they look terribly goofy when tucked in. This shirt stays slim in the abdomen so it is perfect for guys that are a fit and go to the gym. With that said, it isn't too tight on the arms like shirts can be when slim in the midsection. I love these shirts, always wear them to formal and casual events, ALWAYS get compliments, and am about to buy more.
If you want to wear the shirt and not have the shirt wear you, this is a very, very good shirt and great value."
"This dress is gorgeous. Our 6 year old got many compliments
 on it on her birthday."
"After reading through the reviews, I ordered a half-size larger and held my breath waiting for them to arrive. A little concerned by how small they appeared in box, but I put them on hoping that looks can be deceiving. They felt a tight with socks on and snug without socks. Twisted and slid on the carpet throughout the living room and hallway to make sure they weren't going to grab. Satisfied that I wouldn't hurt my knees, I tried them out with a 40-minute Zumba workout (with socks on). Final Assessment: Perfect! I was able to move through the workout with ease. Shoes became comfortable during use. Tried them on again without socks and were a perfect fit. Next workout I did without socks was surprisingly comfortable. After a week's worth of workouts, they're still comfortable and do not show signs of wear-and-tear. I've used these shoes for indoor workouts only. I've reassigned my ""rejected-from-Zumba"" sneakers to outdoor use, errands, etc."
"Awesome fit, love these T-Shirt and will order again. Very please"
"The shirt is pretty nice.  Quality is what I expected.  Don't expect wrinkle free but it's not as bad as 100% cotton.  A warm iron will be needed to have a crisp look.  Material is decent, stitching is fine.  I'd buy it again for $22."
I love these shoes for my boys. They hold up well and the slip on feature is great. They seem to run slightly larger than we are used to but not too bad. More growing room.
This shoe is just what I ordered.
"I love everything about these shoes: the styling, the color, the fit, the feel, the quality, everything.
First the fit: I was concerned they would be too narrow after reading other reviews. I took one reviewers advice and loosened the laces all the way to the toes before my foot in. Then I carefully tightened as I went up, leaving the areas where I need more room to accommodate joint issues in my toes and such a bit looser than the rest of the shoe. This worked great and gives the feeling of wearing completely custom shoes. I ordered them a bit smaller after reading reviews that said they run large, I wear a 9 and ordered the 40 on the first pair and the 40.5 on the second pair. I don't feel much difference between them. Both are comfy. I could even see where if I had gotten the 41 I would have not felt they were too big. If you are going to use these for more aggressive physical activity you may want to stick with the company's sizing. I replaced the insoles right away because I prefer a strong arch support. The ones in the shoe are thin and don't supply the arch support I prefer. The workmanship of the shoe is wonderful. Really well made. All the seams and edges are tight and solid. I can see these lasting a good long time. The suede is just the right thickness, not to stiff, nor too flimsy (Goldilocks would be proud). And the colors are super vibrant and fun. I have NEVER gotten as many comments on my shoes as I have while wearing these plum mojitos or the ""parrot"" mojitos.
These are the most comfortable active shoes I have ever worn!! I consider myself a bit of a shoe fiend, but I only wear shoes that are comfortable, yet stylish/funky like Alegria, Chaco, Keen and Earth. Now Scarpa is on my list. I am so happy to have found a shoe I can wear to the gym or on the trails that feels good and is fun to look at it.
I seriously have had to talk myself down from buying them in every color. But I can guarantee that I will be watching for when other colors go on sale."
"These are very nice, one of the best multicam designs on the market, propper is used by the military and thats why I have used their products in the past, this is the first time buying ACU pants. After 4 games of airsoft they already have holes in the material around the ankles, and shins. These holes are half the size of a penny, tiny holes just appear on the pant leggings... I would have given 5/5 star if they held up better. Going to stick with the BDU's!

updated review from 3 to a 4, I have been using these almost a year and they are still good."
Love this! light weight and long
"I ordered a medium by the size chart, but thought the coat was too small. I am going to return it for a xl. The coat was  really good quality. I loved how it looked."
"A slightly spongy heel, distinct arch, sole and heel thick enough for running, and open weave upper makes this a very comfortable walking shoe. The new, 3rd generation pocket to hold the lace pull is much improved. This iteration of the amphib isn't prone to squeaking-they must have changed the plastic they use."
Great jeans nice fit
This belt is awesome!  It's true to size and made of very good quality leather. I  love it!
"I'm a six and the small was perfect. Since I'm small busted I thought, based on some reviews, that the neckline would be too low. This was not the case. It was perfect."
Looked like it would have been a nice product but was way to small.  Fast shipping.
High qualiity
"I went by the reviews, so ordered one size up  Large, and i wear a 7/8 these fit perfectly!"
Book came fast and has LOTS of storage! Color in he picture and the actual color is spot on! I would purchase this item again for me or as a gift!!!
I am a book lover so of course I had to have this necklace. I like the long chain and it looks good with my cardigans and turtlenecks. It's also been a great conversation piece with my customers.
Nice shirt  hubby liked it
Quality is expected when you buy Carhartt. What a well made kids jacket. I bought him the bib overalls too. Beautiful fit.
"Decent costume.  Some pieces were a little crappy (like the gloves) but overall a great costume.  Worn for Halloween and it was a big hit.  Boot, ears and a wig (if desired) do not come with the costume.  The strap that goes over the shoulder was strong enough to hold a sword but I had to use some leather string to fasten it to the actual shoulder strap.  The shirt is a little snug when taking on and off but once on fits well.  The belt with storage pouches was pretty awesome."
These are lovely and seem well-made. I haven't had a chance to wear them for more than trying on so cannot say how comfortable they are for long term wear.
"Socks stay where they should, haven't had a chance to wash them yet, don't expect any issues.  After a few months of wearing and washing, maybe then it may show signs, but until then, 5 stars."
Great for day to day wear.
"Very good jeans. Excellent color,"
"Cool, comfortable, and a perfect fit!"
Great looking shoes my daughter loves it.
Best flip flop I ever had! Comfortable and sturdy
"Lovely sweater. I ordered the blue and love the color. I wish PattyBoutik incorporated more brighter colors in her sweaters-- it's refreshing to have a sweater in my closet that's a bit brighter.  It's a lighter weight sweater but very soft.  I will also be able to wear this sweater in the spring and fall.

Fit: This is one of PattyBoutik's more fitted sweaters. It really hugs your curves. I am 5'9"" and 128 lb-- I ordered a small. If you're not comfortable with a fitted look, I recommend ordering up a size.

Critique: I took a gamble ordering something that is 24.5"" in length and it is a bit too short on me. When I sit down I have to pull the shirt down because my back is exposed. I would prefer another inch in the length but overall still a cute sweater.  I am going to have to stick to ordering items that are 25"" and longer in length."
great pair of boots for winter
"I really love the metal they are made from, and even if the black elastic finger strings break, I can always replace them some how, it's not as if once they break, you must buy new finger cymbals.  The sound is very pure, and they are small in diameter, but very well crafted for the price."
got this as a present for my dad for christmas it came with in a week. was super satisfied with it. and the price.
"It would be too large if I had ordered an XL as I usually wear -Iordered L and it still is a bit too full , but it would have even been shorter if I ordered a medium.  Cute unique top - lace is a bit fragile on the ends, I'm hemming for more strength. Good  with leggings - I'm 5'2"" 150lbs and it's just a tad short for my age (61).  Full and comfy for sure!"
"This bathing suit looks great!! I was skeptical of ordering a suit online, but this one fits extremely well and is much cuter than most plus size offerings at big-box retailers. I am a size 18, 38F and the size 16 fits very well and doesn't expose too much chest. The boyshort-style legs are very flattering to larger hips and provide coverage for a larger booty."
Not to long and held up in the washer well!
"that is why I give 4 stars for a 43 size , next time I purchase a 42 size."
"We just had our first baby in September so I wanted to make sure Sophia got her Daddy a Christmas present too, eventhough she was only 3 months old lol So this was a great idea! Josh LOVES it! He is 6'2"" and weighs 220lbs and the Large fits him great :-) He is always so proud when he wears this shirt! lol"
There is no other conditioner that works better at keeping boots water protected.
"""They're very comfortable, and soft!""

The teenager likes them..."
Very nice shirt. Good quality material.  Will buy in another color.
"Nice, but too small, will probably give it away."
Love it. I was showing my sister and she is gonna get one. I put some beads on it already. Thanks it's a great birthday gift
Yes!!!!!!
"Laura Biagiotti Essenza Di Roma Eau de Toilette is soft and gentle and reminds me of baby powder but with a hint of muskiness. Other reviewers have said it is bold and woodsy which only shows that body chemistry and noses and tastes are different for each of us.

What most of us can agree on is the pretty slanted, gold topped and ribbed, frosted glass bottle with a wider glass pedestal at the bottom.

I imagine this Eau de Toilette would be fine for any age because it feels innocent."
"good fit, good product"
Great boot wear them almost everyday
"This scarf arrived quickly, and it's well made. I wore it today, and it kept my neck from getting cold. It's not super long, so you can wear in in different ways. For both men and women, who want something cool-looking and classy. Love it!"
She loves them!!!!!!!!
"They fit pretty well, look nice and they are very comfortable."
Great shirt..was worried about it being too small. Fit me very well.
Work great for icy climbs where you need the traction. Clips perfect on outside of pack and weights almost nothing. Absolutely recommend.
Fit and quality were great. Color was just as bright as I had hoped it would be. Very pleased.
Love them! Good grip while on the sailboat too. Probably ordering another pair as they are super comfortable on long walks as well.
"Absolutely love these leggings. Bought for Halloween but they are so comfy and actually look at cute, I wear them all the time! I want more colors now!"
The force is with this shirt.
"Very pretty and very big! They certainly catch light and look great on. If you love big and shiny, this is the earring set for you!"
Absolutely loved this.  It was soft and seemed very warm.  Unfortunately I had to return it because my granddaughter thought it would be too warm and worries about her little one overheating.
Nice. Casual.
"These shirts are Korean sizing so if you're bigger they're not going to work. I bought the XXL for mine, he usually wears an XL in US sizes, XXL or XXXL in Euro. I ordered based on the posted measurements but when the shirts arrived my poor guy couldn't even get them over his arms. He's a biggun (tall, barrel chested, farm-built American). These big bodies built for hard labor are not built for slim-cut Korean shirts. As soon as this seller can make sizes to fit the big guys I will buy again because the quality and style are fantastic. The seller was also really wonderful to deal with."
"Perfect bag for everyday use. Holds all my credits cards, money and other stuff."
"Received this today and tried it on. Items in the past have been unreliable in that they did not stay in place. This product, worn a full and busy day of reaching and stooping and lifting stayed in place and gave a firm appearance. I recommend this to women who, as I, have a little too much fluff in the midriff. It was a bit of a challenge to get into but certainly not as difficult (impossible) as others and quite easy to remove. It held it's shape all day. The straps are a bit thin and did slip down a little."
"It is the perfect size for me. I'm not into carrying huge handbags around. There is plenty of room for wallet, small booklet, pen papers. The 2 outside pockets are perfect for keys in one and lip gloss in the other. It is very well made. I love Fossil bags they last forever. Great value."
"Very nice shoes! They look cool, fit well and seem to be of good quality.  A good price too.  My 8 year old is very happy with them."
"It was good but way too big with good $ cost, and excellent quality"
"These are gorgeous, useful, fun purse holders. I read an article somewhere saying that they tested the bottom of women's purses and found some really nasty germs and bacteria floating around because of our bad habit of setting our purses on the floor, or,ground.
I love that you are shipped 4 holders in an attractive green drawstring bag. You could give 3 of your best friends a purse hanger and still have one for  purself.
There are several different shapes and patterns to choose from when ordering. I chose the birds. These combine functionality and necessity in one well made,  useful product. The only thing I do not like is the direction of the hook. The hook where you hang your purse or bag is facing in, towards the,underside of the,table.
That said, I very much like these purse hangers and I anticipate using them for years to come.)"
Very cute but faded after the first wash.  Super soft and comfy. I'm 5'0 110lbs and they fit perfectly in small.
"The shirt is waaaaay shorter than I thought. Could barely tug it in the skirt. The material is a little see through so you may need to wear a white undershirt. About the skirt, it touches a little above the middle of my thighs, and I'm only 5""1. So it may be very short for higher people. Other than that, the package came fast and neatly folded. Read the size chart before you order, since Asian sizes usual run small. I usually wear size S but I ordered a M."
I'm not new to Clarks. I have numerous Clark shoes and I wear all of them.
I gave this as a gift for Christmas.. my friend loves it.. she replaced her purse with this and it even has room for her tablet and other things that women put in their purses!
Adorable!  The bows add a little something extra cute to the leggings!
Very comfortable. Fits well. Velcro strap helps when feet swell
"5' 4"" (almost) curvy 125-130?lbs person looked great in them! Hard to buy for someone else and these fit her perfectly so I tried another style of Liverpool petite and they fit again. I think this brand is good for this body type and inseam isn't crazy short so even works with this height. They are super soft, sexy, stretchy and awesome"
5 Star fab
bought these as a gift for am 8 year old. she LOVES Them. even wears them to the pool.
"WIll update monthly. If I can get 5 months out of them (understandably swapping out insoles along the way), I'll keep them at 4 stars.  Swapped out the cheap insoles with Dr Scholl's.  Not rating 5 stars initially only because mine came with very short shoe strings for some reason so I'm required to purchase longer ones.

So far, these cheap Asics are on par with the more expensive ones."
"Stretchy, comfortable, non invasive. Great color and fabric too!"
"Fits well, looks great. The material seems flimsy but it washed in the washing machine without incident."
My daughter is obsessed with this sweatshirt. Love it!
"Versatile and comfortable, yet stylish!  Bought two pairs!"
I love this flannel. It's long and fitted and looks great with jeans or leggings!
Used these for a project and worked well for them.
These boots are beautiful and as pictured. They are comfortable but beware of slipping. The fit is as expected. The sole is smooth so I applied some shoe grips on the soles. Now I can walk without the fear of falling.
GREAT PRODUCT!!
"Very comfy and can be worn from daywear into the evening for dinner out.  Grand daughter loves glitter affect of the
dots."
"Obsessed with pasties now! I wish I'd gotten the smaller size but overall I love these. They do not help keep your boobs up or anything so be aware of that. They do kind of get dirty obviously over time, but I was able to rinse them with water and once they dried, they're still pretty sticky. Only when I get really sweaty do I start having some problems, but I can just wipe them off a little and all good to go.

Now I have a million options for dresses and everything that I didn't have before. So happy!"
"Quick delivery, adorable onesie!"
absolutly in love with this
An inside joke on my Sister and I sent her this hat and a little striped dress to match.  What a hottie on her way to courthouse!!
"Very nice!  Looks great on me, as my husband tell me.  If less expensive to purchase, would get a second pair in a different color."
I like these pants. They are very heavy duty and have just enough room to wear heavy liners in case of very cold weather.
"Came with the box, looks great good quality and my son loves them!"
"I really like the swimsuit; however, it fits kind of small.  I would say it is closer to the size below not the 14-16."
Nice product for a gift
"My 9-year-old LOVES this shirt. It washes great and dries fast, so his mother does too!"
"I have recently been comparing some of the higher end socks trying to determine which, if any, are worth the extra money.  Something about spending $15 for one pair of socks makes me cringe... but I bought them in the name of knowledge.

Well I have to say, these Gold Toe socks are just as good, if not better.  And at 3 pair for $17 a bargain in comparison.  You can tell these are well made from the first time you slip them on.  The material is thick enough to lend support and comfort without having to go up a shoe size.  The seam at the toe is not too bad - I wish they could find a way to do away with them altogether!

Overall - a very nice pair of socks I would easily compare with the topmost expensive brands."
This is a really nice shirt. The green really pops and makes green eyed men stand out in a room. Nothing but compliments. I ordered a size large instead of a medium because of other reviews. Its a wee bit baggy but livable and looks great on him
Purchased to use for small sterling silver favors at a tea. Everyone was pleased and happy that their silver charm would remain tarnish free if they kept it in the pretty little copper colored bag.
Nice band but way too big. My husband doesn't have small wrists either.
"There are a few flaws to the mask, but over all this was a good buy and I would recommend to any hardcore Tokyo Ghoul fan."
"My 15 year old loves the fit of this particular shoe, this being the 3rd pair of Kinvara's he has worn.  He has a very particular foot, and has not found another fit that he likes.  As a parent of an active teenage son, I wish the shoe was a bit more resilient to the wear and tear of constant use.  They wear out within 6 months, which makes them pricey to replace."
This is so much America I love it. Great way to represent.
Bought these for my husband he says The Shoes fits great. They are very comfortable. They are a great running shoe.
I don't know how many pair of Levi's I have ordered this year.  This one is great and have in different sizes as I have been losing weight this year.
"This watch has received many compliments, it looks more expensive than it is.  As watches go, it is the opposite of the Movado, and definitely not of the diver/rolex wannabe crowd- it is unique.  The case is thick, the band is thick.  The face is large but not as large as the latest fashion watch faces.  It is definitely a masculine heavy watch.  The case has been easier to scratch the case than I like, it is a nice looking watch but not for all occasions.  The case design is slightly art deco in my opinion."
Super soft and comfortable. Feels exactly like the robes I've gotten at casino spas in Biloxi. I've washed the robe several times now and haven't had any deterioration of the material so it seems very durable. Love the large pockets.
Of course smart wool you cant go wrong:)
"I do like this tie.  Like the color, like the price, like the feel, but I just can't keep it tied... it always slips out of it's knot.  My be user error as I'm new to bow ties."
"A bit lighter weight than I thought, but nice anyway."
was a present. but he loves it!
We had purchased the scorpion costume but the mask kinda sucked so we decided to buy this mask and it made a world of a difference! Looked fantastic and realistic
"I was worried I'd look a little like Barney in this dress. I wear a size ten and am short, 5'1"". I ordered an XL and it fits well.

The top two snaps are designed to be left undone. If you close them, the fabric puckers.

It's a casual dress. Nice for work. You may want to add a colorful scarf to break up all the purple."
Nice shoes for the price.  The are very cute and look just like the photo.  The soles have NO traction and are slippery  - so be aware of that.  COuld be good for dancing.
U can't believe how beautiful and comfortable this is.
"I really love these! The are soft and warm. The soles are way too slippery in the beginning, but they soften up a bit."
"This hat is very cute.  I like the that the material is light for a hot day.  I wish it lasted longer, our daughter grew out of it pretty quick.  It does the job.  The only thing is my daughter would pull the string and untie the hat pretty easily.  The velcro strap was a bet better for our purpose."
Durable and do the job.
"Watches in this price range typically fall into the ""underwhelming"" category.  Surprisingly this one raised the bar!

The look and feel of the band and face give a more sophisticated sense, and I get compliments on it quite frequently."
Great shoe and so comfortable.  Planning on getting another pair. :)
my son loves the socks he wears them for football.
Reading the other reviews on size and quality prepared me for this hat. Build quality I wouldn't say is top notch but it's not bad either. Perfectly acceptable to wear everyday as long as it lasts. It does seen a bit big but not comical like others described. I guess I got a good one. My 6yr old is using it for his ash costume and loves it. An older boy recognized the hat at an arcade and my son was thrilled. I'll probably buy another as my little girl wants one too.
"awesome, the only bad thing is that they don't have pockets"
"read a review that they ran small, they actually run tru size."
Incredibly comfortable to wear. Glides onto my finger. Compliments each time I wear it...and I wear it a lot !
Absolutely adorable and makes such a cute gift!
Comfortable shoe and like the style. I wish my daughter's size was available in this style as we went with the Sanuk Kids G Yoga Slingshot Prints and they just do not stay on her feet.
"Very pretty, and I'm looking forward to being able to see thru it during the next rainstorm!"
Used these while I traveled around Australia for 3 months. Backpacking/traveling LIFE SAVER! I have since used them while I take shorter trips as well- they just help keep the suitcase organized. I also appreciate the laundry bag.
I am a thick girl and the fit was good.  It did not come up as high as you see on the picture. I wanted it closer to my neck; however it came up over my breast.  A nice piece to add to your lingerie.
Solved my running problem in winter. Cute looking and warm. Would recommend it.
I wasn't sure what size to order as I had a baby awhile ago. So ordering the wrong size was all my fault.
"I. am. in. love. with. this. bag. First of all, let me just say I'm a female and this bag is amazing so if you're a woman and you really want it, don't feel like it's too masculine or manly or whatever for you to get it. This bag is seriously beautiful and I was amazed when I pulled out of the box. It comes in a pretty big box and when I read other reviews saying it wasn't that big, I was surprised at what I pulled out. This bag is definitely bigger than an overnighter. I could easily pack a whole vacation in this thing - that being said, I think I pack less on vacation than the average American. The bag is super spacious on the inside and it has a pocket that fits my Amazon tablet twice. My guess is it could fit a 13"" laptop, the pocket itself is big and it's super padded especially for electronics. It's lined along the inside and it has a few more inner pockets, including a zipped one. The leather on the outside is AMAZING. It's really nice, wonderful quality and smells so good. I got the black version and it's so sultry and elegant up close and far away. It came stuffed to the gills with Dory stuffing paper (no pun intended) and was covered in a protective slip. It seriously came in perfect condition. It comes with a cloth and leather strap which attaches really nice and securely to the sides. I feel so luxurious with this bag, almost like I shouldn't have it. If you want a heavy duty but elegant looking travel bag, get this one. I received mine at a discount in exchange for a review and I feel super lucky, I can't believe I got this!"
Love this!  So cute with shorts or skinny jeans.  I bought a replacement because my first one had the fringe start unraveling.  Haven't happened on this one yet.  Hand wash as well.
Comfy. Flexible. Nice work shoes.
"The plating isn't amazing, but these look very nice; and sizes are pretty!"
"This does an alright job. The wax used in is seems to be softer than in other Kiwi black polishes I've used. Because it is softer, a quick rub brings plenty out of the can easier and a little goes a long way."
"Originally purchased to be my wife's valentines gift, my mother also will be getting one of these for her birthday.

I made the original purchase decision based on all of the positive feedback and my wife could not be happier."
"I love new balance shoes.  I have fibromyalgia and they are the only brand that doesn't kill my feet.  The only thing is where the first hole is on the right shoe has a tendency to to ""dig"" in."
"As advertised, good supplier"
Beautiful scarf that goes with almost everything and very nice quality. Hoping to find other seasonal scarves like this one
Great undershirts.  Just as advertised.
"Great price, great product, great seller!"
VERY NICE.... love it.
"These really are just about the perfect pumps.  I might just get one in every color.  They are very high, true to size, and actually pretty comfortable!"
A bit loose is good. High temperature & humidity this jacket still breathes unlike other sun screen light see through type jackets.
"Nice boots, great price. I'm sure they'll last quite a while."
"Agree with the rest of the reviews - this dress is amazing. Fits perfectly - I got a small,  Im 5'5 130 lbs, I have short legs and it barely touches the ground in flats. Super cute with heels. The material is nice quality - I got compliments within an hour of putting it on. I LOVE it and will be buying another one in a different color!"
Looks great came early.
Great school sneakers.
I love these shoes. Definitely size down. I am a 7.5 ordered 8 because I thought thick socks would fix it. No had to return and ordered a size 7 still a tad to big but not uncomfortable.
Great looking shoe. Fits a little narrow (I'm 8.5D). Hope they loosen a little over time.
These gloves are thick and very cozy. Unfortunately my granddaughter is very picky and decided she no longer wanted them.
Great shoe I have about 4pair of this still and they feel great if you want a pair of comfortable shoes this is it
"The lacing on the bottom of the front sometimes curls under and is a little bit scratchy, but otherwise this is a good bra."
"I have long been a fan of Citizen's quality and craftsmanship. After my previous Eco-Drive was scratched up, beat up, and for all intents and purposes.. worn out.. Yet, still working.. I began to look for a newer model with a few bells and whistles.. Mere words cannot describe how happy I am with this new watch. Granted, there was a learning curve getting everything set, but actually if I had set my male ego aside and actually READ the instructions.. I would have nailed all settings within 10 minutes.. If you can't read, understand, and implement instructions for an advanced timepiece.. By all means.. Buy a Timex.. LOL

I Love This Watch!! It is one of the best investments I have made for ""ME"" in quite some time.. I HIGHLY recommend it!!

Trust me, you will NOT regret buying this watch!!"
I got these for Christmas and I haven't taken them off since.  I wear them as a slipper around the house.  They have great grip and I could even get away with wearing them out.
Loved the glasses.
I love this flannel top! I ordered the 1st one to small but I'm ordering next one a size up. I love the length. Its hard to find longer tops. I will wash in cold water and line dry. I hope this will avoid shrinking.
"I have this Champion Women's Shape Too sports bra in many colors.  I love this bra!  It fits just as I expected- I typically wear on the first row of hooks, but if i'm having a day where I feel I need a little more support then I'll wear on the second row of hooks.  A little bounce, but not like other brands i've tried (C cup; to me a little bounce should be expected or your fooling yourself).  I've tried many brands; some very expensive, some not so expensive; I seem to return to this specific bra everytime.  My mode of fitness is primarily running, 4-5 days per week, never less than 5 miles.  I'm done wasting my money on other brands; this high impact sports bra is a keeper!"
They have a very soft feel and the fit is great. The color and shape are holding up really great. Excellent quality.
Perfect shoes for a flower girl!
I ordered my exact size and it fits perfectly
"Time to streamline: my bedroom is SO MUCH NEATER NOW and I'm getting rid of the little chests of plastic drawers that were such a jumble.  I've been carefully choosing jewelry chests, display boxes and racks to make ALL my jewelry visible and well-organized. and I smile just when I walk in the room.  I've gotten rid of all the jewelry I don't like: no matter what it cost or how much I love the person I got it from, if I don't wear it, I don't want it lying around.

I just opened this up this reviewed box and it's perfect! Well...it would a plus if it had the ribbon at the side which prevented the top folding all the way back but perhaps some people don't want that. (I'll just have to be careful not to fling this back and break the glass.)  This ribbon is on another case I purchased which matches this reviewed one with the exception that that case has two latches instead of one, as here:

To complement this reviewed box, I got this velveteen insert which fits it perfectly:

I find this case extremely helpful for my earrings.  Sadly, it's no longer available in black but only blue and pink.  And though it doesn't have a glass top but, instead, a mirror and lift-out compartmented tray so it's more compact than these display boxes while matching them nicely:

The prices for all these items on Amazon are so reasonable.  There is a lot of variety so be careful as you look around because there are so many different inserts and compartments to choose from."
Daughter loves these. Not too heavy. Just a little something to throw on over something sleeveless
"I got so sick of seeing the low slung jeans, the ones that make a girl's butt look like it's half on her thigh because of the weird pocket placement.  I also don't like the way I'm CONSTANTLY pulling up my (former) low slung jeans...and it's not just me, I noticed my young stepdaughter does as well as my even younger niece.  I'm too annoyed with pants I have to constantly tug on.  Some people like to refer to these and my other favs, Not Your Daughter's jeans, as ""Mom jeans"".  Yeah, I'm a mom.  But this style of jean was all there was when I was in my teens, so it's what I'm used to - jeans that come to just below my belly button.  No muffin top with this kind, if muffin top is something you need to be concerned with (so many more young girls with muffin top could use this style, so calling them Mom Jeans is kinda dumb when the teens and tweens could use them more than most mothers).  Back pockets are located where back pockets should be, high on keister and not low on the top of the thigh.  I guess these jeans give a more rounded (""bubble butt"") tush, whereas the low-slung jeans make even the gymnasts look like they have pancake butt. Just comfortable jeans that fit true-to-size.  I will say that I like skinny jeans better than boot cut, too, as I think boot cut makes legs look chunkier, but that's just another of my opinions."
"My son who is a medium size, loved it.  After reading the reviews I almost bought a large.  Glad I did not.  Very soft."
I chose this rating because the bra is good quality it feels comfortable
"Nice looking, COMFORTABLE shoe."
"This is such a cute pendant!  I gave it to my ten-year-old niece for when she finished her Junior Lifeguard training this summer, but the chain is long enough that it would also be fine for an adult.

The fish itself was smaller than I had expected, but the Swarovski crystals are nicely laid, and look like they will be very secure.

The chain is also very fine and delicate, and so you will have to be careful when wearing it because it seems like it could break easily.

Overall, this is a darling little fish, and the crystals make it very vivid and bright."

 Product Need: Cheap St. Patricks Day dress up
 Pros: Price, combo
 Cons: n/a
 My thoughts: For the price I highly recommend this to get dressed up and have fun for St. Patricks day festivities. Setting expectations this is not a high quality hat as it is made of a polyester fabric like something you would get at a carnival. The shamrock is even glued on the felt buckle. But the hat fits most normal sized head of adults and has a fun look to it rather than classy. It is well made however, just a little floppy. And the bonus is this set also comes with a bow tie that is a little higher quality than the hat and is sequenced (stitched on) and shiny. For the price this is a great festive set. I will continue to use the product and update if any updates are warranted such as defects or additional missing uses/information that you should know that I may have missed and will answer any questions about the product. Please note I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest feedback that had no impact in my review or ratings."
Had it almost two years and the color has not fade. love the cuff links.
I ordered the wide X-Large and they fit my wide feet pretty perfect. So happy with this purchase! Thank you
"Good quality, just doesn't look as good on me as on the model. Nothing new."
"Looks good, inexpensive, I can swim in it. I have not changed watches for over 10 years since I actually know how to use all of the features of this watch."
"I ordered 5 in purple, and 1 in pink for our bachelorette.  They accidentally sent 6 purple, but quickly corrected the problem.

The gloves were a HUGE hit with the girls!!  They were comfy, stylish, and fit all of us very well, since the ribbons enabled us to adjust the fit.  The open fingers were very convenient, as we could hold our drinks and pull out our phones.  We received a lot of comments on them when we were out.

Couldn't be happier with the customer service, quality, and overall look/feel of the product."
"The shoes are as pretty as the picture shows but in my case, it made a blister. UPDATED after the second time I put this shoes nothing happen. It's very comfortable."
"Very strange.  The waist is too small, but rest is large enough.  There was no mid size available.  I like the product very much."
As I stated above.
"I will probably buy more of these shoes in different colors. I have to wear close-toed flats at work (social worker in a hospital), so these fit the bill."
"If you like order, you'll appreciate these organizers."
Love them super cute
"The bag is ok for the price... Doesn't have any pockets outside or inside, so just a plain backpack, but it fits what is been used for, but one pocket would be nice... My daughter likes it..."
"Great hoodie! Gotta be careful with the zipper, but kind of expected with the faux fur.."
"Im amazed how comfortable these shoes are! They fit perfect, true to size. Mesh toe keeps your feet cool and the comfy soles allow me to walk on them all day. Ive just ordered a 2nd pair because Im going to wear these out if I continue wearing them every day."
Great shirt as long as you listen to the other reviews and get a size smaller than usual. I'm always a medium and the small fits me perfectly for this shirt.
Ring is pretty and looks really good. It shines like a diamond. Have gad a lot of compliments on it.
Kept the sun off my head on a recent trip to the south. Love it.
Doesn't slip off my head.  I can adjust it to fit how I need.  A great headband!  I will buy more.
"Very cute, perfect size for when you want to leave your handbag at home and just grab this. It holds my iphone, keys, and has little slots for credit cards."
"I was really surprised on how these pants fit just right. I'm a 5'8"" 150lbs. Would recommend"
Easy to clean but they do start to discolor a bit.
Really cute and washes up nicely.
I love them. Just wish they were a little thicker.
I use this to store the few formal dresses I have and its perfect! Keeps cat hair out and is easy to travel with! Looks nice and clean too!
this is the second pair of this style I have. I love the cushiony support they give. I feel like they almost return energy to my feet and legs even after hours of being on my feet. I use the one pair while riding bike as the bottom of them grips the pedals and prevents any slipping. I would obviously buy them again since I already did.
"Love them, and so glad to have gotten them on a deal of the day price! They fit beautifully, and they don't have that cheap denim sag at the end of the day. Lucky Jeans are my favorites, I'll keep watching for another sale on them."
"My stepmother loves wolves and earrings so this was a natural fit, she loved them.  These were also affordable which is a major plus for me."
Love the shoes except the shoelaces are way too long!
"Really cute, but apparently for children i thought they were for women. So i gave them away."
I bought this  Halloween costume  For a long time already but my daughter love it so much and she still had that dress is very comfortable to wear. Give 5star for sure
Thin but for the price I paid it's ok.
very cute & comfortable
"Beautiful blue and even nicer than pictured.  My Dad loves Cuba Vera, he was very happy to get this for his birthday."
"This dress fits well and is comfortable.  Basic color lends to variations, such as wearing with different colored stockings and hair bows."
Amazing jeans!  I use them for every day and horsemanship so they are getting well used. So comfortable and I get tons of complements.  I am a size 16 so I'm not a model by any means but they look really good on.
Grandson's favorite pjs.
"Great for post back surgery. A little hard to do hooks at first, but when I moved the lace over, it was much easier. Very flexible due to elastic."
"Very flattering and lovely.  I am 5'3"" and a size 14.  My only complaint is it is very long.  You can fold down the top or pull it up higher on your waist.  I wore dress sandals with a one inch wedge heel and the skirt was down on the ground.  I'm still very happy with this purchase."
"Style and comfort but sturdy ... And waterproof ! Only tried them.  I haven't tested them out yet, but I will real soon"
"The material was itchy and stiff...but after I washed it 2 or 3 times with lots of fabric softener, it is comfy."
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my d-i-l and wasn't sure if the color would be true to the picture or the right size.  When I opened it, I fell in love with the top!  The color is true to the picture.  The most important thing, of course, is she loved it, my son really loved it, so it was the perfect gift!"
"Items came quick and packaged nice.  Great products,  we are currently using them on vacation and they are def keeping us warm!  Thanks"
"This ring is very pretty although the blue is darker than it appears here on the website. It's still very nice though, and worth the money."
Ive been wearing these for many years and needed new ones. Amazons price was literally $15 less than all other stores. Yippee!!
this jeans fits great gives a good shape I'm very happy with my purchase is recommend it get it
As many others have said - these are excellent fitted Ts at a fantastic price - I decided to try these because they look similar to American Apparel tri-blend Ts which used to be my go-to favorite until now!
"Stiff and tight but does stretch to better fit. Im 5'9 and 170, dealing with a large cancer bellly to minimize. Good color, launders well.  Dressier than expected but tight at ankle area more than anticipated. Ok alternative for jean wear."
The lady I got it for loved it on her baby girl. The gift pack was a plus too.
"These boots are extremely comfortable and look great, I was hesitant to give them 5 strs though because it took so long to be delivered. I ordered another pair of boots (from a different seller) and a Justin Hat (also from a different seller) and they got here within 3 days while these boots took 8 day to get here. Regaurdless though the boots themself are great, I ordered 11.5 EE and they fit pretty well although they could have been just a tad wider in the toes but it's not enough of a problem to make them uncomfortable for me."
"If you are looking for a large bag, this is it, plenty of pockets, beautiful color; only negative thing is that the woven braiding on the lower half of the bag is sometimes 'loose' while it should be tight. Would purchase again, as the price was extremely low (due to a credit given)..."
"This a good watch band. The criss-cross pattern seems more pronounced than the pictures show, so play you design-matching accordingly."
"Browning socks quickly became my favorite socks. Good fit, comfortable and they stay up. What more could you ask for a pair of socks."
the shoes are really very compforble I recommend them
"This is a unique style.  Love the bands just below the knee, not too tight.  Fits nicely all around.  The side pockets are handy.  Am ordering additional pants in this style but up a size to a large, to avoid those dreaded ""panty lines""."
"Have been wearing these for years, but was hesitant to purchase a new pack after reading reviews from folks who noticed a never ending smell.  Thankfully, I was one of the lucky ones.  Purchased two packs and had no problems."
Great watch and fits my wrist perfectly. This watch is created for a small wrist so if you have a large wrist do you buy it as it will be too small and very uncomfortable. It is a bit different from the normal watch but I like it.
"Fits true to size, is a great color for spring and I have rec'd many compliments on the shoes. Love them"
Item fits perfectly.
Very pretty ring and of good quality. True to size. Smooth transaction and fast delivery.
I love these! Very comfy!
Sweet fett shirt!
Just I needed
"Lots of toe room, comfortable right out of the box with no socks on. However, feet got a little sweaty - but they are built to be waterproof, and that probably goes both ways, right?"
"Awesome tie clips for the price; I have gotten a lot of complements from them. Do remember these are for fat ties.
For Skinny ties: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IU06WTU/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1"
"I have 10 pairs of aerosoles in my closet, and love them for their comfort, durability, and reliability to go with my cute and casual blue jeans, short, crops, and capris. My foot size is consistant, but with this particular pair, 1 foot fit slightly snug and smaller than needed.  Hopefully it will stretch out with wear, since its a soft leather."
Finally a shirt that covers your butt when you bend over.
Really nice. Colours as shown however my heel slips out. I usually wear a 10 in skechers sneakers so I got the same size. Still very pleased . Will just get a heel insert.
"I really like these convertible pants/shorts.  This is my 4th pair.  When trying these on, I realized I got the exact color last year. Lol. They are well made, but with woman within clothing I always have to go down a size.  Gotta love that!  I would recommend these shorts."
"Super cute little jacket. I do believe it was advertised as a shark but it looked like a monster to me so I got it for my little monster. Fit well, sad when he out grew it."
"Excellent fit, great quality, tremendous low price...highly recommend"
"I wanted a bag that I could just throw stuff in.  Didn't need all the pockets and zipper places that other bags tout.  This has one for a couple pens and such.  Throw in my coffee thermos, kindle fire, a snack and I'm ready for the day.  Strong canvas, will be easy to wash if needed and a very comfortable padded strap.  Beats out my sling bag I've been using."
"Great looking backpack, feels sturdy, strong stitching, and had plenty of pockets and compartments.  Bought one for myself, and one for each of my boys.  Still holding up great."
"I bought four of these in different colors after reading reviews of several ""camp shirts"".  I especially like that the sleeves are not ""cap"" sleeves and come almost to the elbow. I did not want pockets, and these shirts don't have them. As other reviewers noted, the shirts are a nice weight, but not too light.  Where I live now, we get some summer warm days, but very few hot days, so I don't need light weight clothing.  I bought each color that was available at this time.  The Mediums fit like Medium should. I appreciate the seller is willing to send to APO addresses.  Some Amazon sellers will not do that."
"totally love these! the 51mm is perfect for my face and i've gotten a ton of compliments because of how unique looking they are. the bronze looks almost like a muted gold in person which I liked even better since I tend to wear gold jewelry anyways. definitely recommend, especially at this price!"
"I wasn't expecting much considering the price, but I was surprised! This scarf is SO soft and huge! Absolutely a great buy!"
Absolutely adorable. The photo doesn't give it justice.
GREAT LOOKING FLASHY SOCK TRHESE ARE THE SECOND ONES I BOUGHT JUST WHAT I WANTED TO SEND AS A GIFT TO MY FRIEND IN SYRACUSE NY
Awsome. Its a beautiful item.  Fine details and excellent materials  Fit as expected
"Nice shirt, very soft and lightweight. I get exposed to the sun and have very fair skin so I wanted something with long sleeves and bought a size or two larger intentionally so my hands were completely covered, but it looks good, and really feels good...I wish they had more colors like shades of green a bit lighter than army green, an even paler pink, pale violet, and other lighter shades of varying hues going into the summer..."
"Very stylish. I like them, I ordered 3 different colors. All very  pretty."
Skechers are another brand that I love their shoes.  It has enough sole support on them you can walk around in them all day.  I would recommend them
Very comfortable to run in
little snug but good
I already wrote a review on these shoes they are absolutely fantastic and I now own four pair
We loved our shirts. Got a lot of compliments
I bought this necklace with the Sanwood Elastic Mirror belt and they match perfectly. Love it. and will recommend it to my GF's.
"These headbands are soft and super stretchy. I'm a little disappointed with the hair bows that came with them though. The bows are made of good quality materials, but were crushed, bent, and misshapened and seem to be carelessly made. I'm hoping the bows straighten out over time. If not, I will be able to use different hair clips with the headbands, so its not a big deal."
Its well made i say order a size bigger :)
"wish it sagged a bit more in the back but i was anticipating a little tightness from having a large arse.
overall it fits pretty well.
note: doesn't close completely on me, but then again I don't think it's supposed to."
Such a great costume! The hat is a little smushed but that was expected. Can't wait to wear this on Halloween!
Very comfortable sandals.  Already owned a pair and wanted another color.
"Simple solution to common problem.  Wear them daily. I did have a few that split too easily, but if you glue two together, it'll help solve that problem. Great deal for the price, even if a few split."
"I like the tote overall, the bright beachy, but not tacky, colors are very cheerful. The rope strap is a nice touch, although it was rather long, so I just untied the knots and retied them further up the rope in order to shorten it a bit. It definitely is very roomy, which is what I needed for my stuff and my daughter's. We can put in 2 large beach towels, sunscreen, and water bottles with some room left over. The one thing I'm not crazy about is the lack of secure pockets. There is one zippered pocket inside the bag, but it's a tad small. There are only 2 other outside pockets, but these aren't secure- there is no snap or zipper or anything on them, so I don't feel comfortable putting anything in them of value like keys, water passes, money etc. Fine for water bottles but that's about it."
perfect bootie
"Gteat, nice looking wallet my husband loved just what he was looking for"
"Very comfty and light!!, my girl love them
I wanted nice and light shoes and i just found them!!..i""ll buy saucony again!!"
"It's a small leather case/wallet .... no larger than the card(s) you will be using this for.  I assume it protects as it states.  Personally, I wish it were slightly larger only to make these old fingers able to access the cards a bit easier.
 If you want something small, this is it.  It seems to be well made and I would recommend it."
"LOVE!
Comfy, stretchy & NO PANTY LINES!
What  more could a girl ask for ??"
Great fit and very comfortable for the price. Bought for my 22yr old Son and he is wanting to buy another pair for back up. He is so happy with these shoes. Thank God for the size 12. Amazon this was a hit. Thank you...
"My husband missed the side pockets, my bad.  The pants wash really well and dry wrinkless. I'll choose the others when these have gone into destruct mode, which may be a long time. Great work pants,"
"This is beautiful! It's great for lounging around the house, and even though it's long the slits on the sides help you not get caught up in it.  Fits great, and is silky and smooth.  I'm so glad I spent a little more to get a high quality product."
Love bearpaw slippers! These are perfect size and perfect style! These are our favorite slippers and they last for years!!
"Fantastic price and fantastic t-shirts. Unusual but appreciated combination :)
They are rather thin but works great as undershirts.
I'm 6'2 and 220 and the L is perfect for me (a little big tight as an undershirt should be but not uncomfortable in any way).
Length and quality are great."
Dansko shoes are worth the price every time. Just wish sizing was consistent.  Once you get the sizing correct you will love the fit and all day fit of this brand.
"Fits well, keeps me warm."
"Fits me well and comfortable. I bought the white ones.
It says Machine wash do not bleach.
Also, made in Vietnam."
Coolest shades on the planet
"Awesome ring.  Big and heavy/solid.  More than I expected for the price.  Stop thinking and just buy it, you won't be disappointed."
"Super comfy, my husband says. We've tried several brands and these are his favorite."
"I just received this today and I really like it. It fits but I should have probably ordered a smaller size but I like that I can wear a sweatshirt underneath and sit with it zipped up. It could be a bit longer but it isn't that bad. The sleeves are adequate length, unlike other plus size coats I've purchased. I couldn't imagine wearing a coat heavier than this. I just wore it outside in 5 degree weather with a hoodie underneath and was comfortable. Great coat! As a comparison, the last cost I bought was a 4x from Woman Within that was a piece of crap and the sleeves were too long but fit otherwise."
"I wish it was a lil larger, but it felt so good.
Did want to take it off"
Great product with lots of room.
"I bought this for work, my desk has a cold spot in the winter and this does the trick.  Overall, this is a very good quality sweatshirt for the price of around $10.  I read another review that found it to be scratchy but I don't have that issue.  The fit is correct for my size and it's comfortable to wear.  The neck, as another review pointed out, is a little small but I have a large neck (21"") and I can still wear the sweatshirt comfortably, just wish it had a slightly larger opening.  Very warm for a light product too."
i love this wallet. my previous trifold was a bit smaller but this feels great and has enough compartments for most.
I think the S size is better than what i have chose .
Going to order another one...LOVE IT
Lovely. they can sort of blend and pass for regular size earing I am a 0g. the light shines through the back and makes them sparkle. very nice.
LOVE THIS HAT.
"I read other reviews and so I knew to order this a few sizes larger than I thought (also the size chart was pretty accurate once I measured myself). This is a very well made corset and I got a lot of compliments. My only minor complaint is that there is no hook at the top of the zipper, which seems like an oversight since some prankster could pull the zipper down pretty easily. I'll sew one on myself though since it's an easy fix. Also if you're ahem 'larger' up top, and driving in this, I recommend an overshirt of some sort since it's not very supportive once you're sitting and kind of hunched over."
"Study and does the job.

Update: 5/7/15:  Broke after only 5 months of use.  It was not dropped or misused. I really liked the look and feel but would not buy again."
"Got it because it is ripstop although the material is so thin, I haven't had a chance to test that yet.  Very attractive and very comfortable.  A good Columbia buy.  If you normally get large, though, you might want medium in this one.  I have very long for my height (34-35) and the large came way down over my hands.  Even the medium is a little longer than I like, but small is too small.  Got mine for a great price thru Amazon.  I'm happy"
"I normally wear a size 6 1/2 M shoe, so I purchased these Fitkicks in a size Small and they fit perfectly with a bit of room in the toes left over.  I've worn them all day both indoors and out and they're quite comfortable.  There's enough stretch to get them on easily, and the sole is just thick enough to walk down my gravel path while still having the next-to-nothing barefoot feel. The print is cool too.

I withheld one star for two reasons:
1) Price.  I paid $22.99 for mine and afterward saw them for $17.99 elsewhere.
2) Style.  While I love the ""Graphite"" print with the contrasting cross-strap, the positioning of the suede patch with the widest portion going to the inside of foot actually gives the appearance of being ""pigeon-toed"".  I would have liked the suede going straight across the toes; I think it would look much better."
simply Love it
Better quality than the lenses that come with glasses.
"Great costume.  Our hat is more brown, and did not come with the ribbon, so we will have to add it.  We will also need to purchase gloves, which I realized.  Did not realize the hat would not have the gold ribbon, so removing one star for that."
"I was a little scare of getting this because of the price, but I seen some reviews so I thought I take the risk. To my surprise I glad I got this. The shipping was really fast (took like 1 day). The product is like the one on the photo. I see no rips, holes or anything. The bottom fits really great. The top fits great as well, but it is a little lose, but not to the point it falls out. It does seem the fabric is cheap, but to be expected. I love it all together <3"
"I love it. The only draw back is that it holds a lot and you can end up miserable lugging it around. I think I've gotten spoiled with rolling suitcases. This  is great for a car trip, or if you actually know how to pack lightly (I don't). Alternatively, this works great as an additional piece ON TOP of your rolling suitcase"
"I love the look- great color options. I would like the item to be a bit longer. But the best feature is, there is no need to iron it, right out of the dryer.  Fits well, long ties make it easy to wrap around twice."
Fits like a dream. I love the thumb holes. Good quality.
Super cute and super fun! Fit exactly like they're supposed to!
"I bought these for my husband as the puppy decided his old ones were mighty tasty.  I thought, why not, the price is right, he just needs a pair of simple slippers.  They are really comfortable and a GREAT price and a cool color---I bought the navy since my husband wears jeans all the time.
Thank you again, Amazon----you R-O-C-K!"
"I am happy with this. A bit lower in hips than expected, but fine. Came quickly."
"Let me start off by saying I LOVE Sketchers and I've worn them for years. NO Other Brand (in my opinion) comes close to providing the Comfort of Sketchers Shoes. They seem to be made Specially for My Feet. I've had RA for the last 26yrs.and back problems for the past 9. which has made walking very difficult. Thanks to a great Orthopedic Surgeon, I can now walk again.
This is my 1st pair of Sketchers Go Walk Walking Shoe.and as I Expected, The COMFORT IS AWESOME! These Are Sooo EASY to Slip Into (I can't tie laces anymore) and My Feet Feel as if They're Walking on a Cloud! I Could Not Ask for Better, These Shoes ARE PERFECT!! Give them a Try.....I'm SURE You WILL LOVE Them! Your Feet WILL Thank You And Be As HAPPY As Mine!
THANK YOU Amazon and Sketchers, Once Again You ARE AMAZING!"
Comfortable fit and very cute!
"I remember the Juicy Couture store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. There was also a store in the Century City Mall. Sadly, they closed their doors and all U.S. stores not too long ago. But the JC distinctive style and brand lives on in timepieces like this ""Socialite"" model.

JC always adds a hip touch to their designs, in this case with the pink tip on the second hand and crystal charm accent.  This design is perfect for a night on the town or cocktail party.  My wife loved it! The Socialite Quartz is also lightweight and scratch-resistant. She said, ""Couture time"" is cool in her book.

The only critique is that the band may need to be readjusted, unless your wrist is thicker. You may need to take it to a local jeweler and have it resized or have some links removed (this is an easy and inexpensive adjustment)."
These are so colorful and match most any outfit.  The baby wears leg warmers quite often.  My daughter was thrilled to get them.  Good quality.  Highly recommend!!
"Gift for gf, simple & elegant"
"I've purchased several pairs of running shoes over the past year training for 1/2 marathons and marathons.  I typically buy Asics but, based on a recommendation from a salesman at a local running store, decided to give the Ultra Boost's a try.  They are like walking on a cloud.  Not a messy, squishy cloud but a soft cloud.  They also provide ample arch support for me.  One thing that was very different was the fit - these are very snug, like a sock.  Wearing thick socks would be uncomfortable.  The toe-box is snug but the whole shoe is designed to fit like a glove, so that is to be expected.  They are also the lightest shoe I have ever worn.  There is plenty of cushion at the heel and less in the mid-foot forward.  I think the shoe is just right.  I got solar yellow and have been easy to pick out of the running crowd at events.  If you have wide feet, I don't think these would work."
Nice dress fits perfectly.
I love  this top...it's perfect...great seller
My son loves it! it's not too heavy or puffy. Perfect for 50-60 temps we get in Houston. It's also water resistant and washable. Great coat!
"I am 6'2.  195 lbs.  Not much of a gut, but a little.
This shirt fits perfectly and is made of quality material.
The graphics are a little bright but I liked it."
"color is great shrinkage not so much but at least I expected that. Order accordingly and you'll be fine. I bought specifically for length, in my opinion they could still be a little longer."
Great Robe!  My husband loves the snuggly feeling and can't wait to put it on when he comes home from work.
Unless you like very loose fitting shirts I would recommend getting a size smaller than what you would normally wear.
Very comfortable and WARM but loose fitting. Not for slender feet.
"Purchased for my martial artist. She loves it. Good fit and comfort, great color."
"I really like this sweater- it is lovely and can be worn with jeans or black pants/dressed up for work or down for the weekend/a winter hike with some good additional layers.  Mid to low hip length is flattering and forgiving.

On the positive side, the design is classic and attractive.  I do want to say that it feels and looks like what it is, though, a primarily acrylic sweater.  The wool content is not noticeable in touch or warmth (but again, on the positive side less wool means less itchiness for many people).

On the negative side, the sweater zipper bulges out several inches away from the body in a strange way when I am seated.  When standing it is perfect and lovely.  I am a size XL with large chest and unfortunately large belly, so take my comments with that grain of salt.  :)  I do not find this sweater to be unforgiving in the hips or chest- in fact, it has some stretch, but also has enough body that it is not clingy/does not appear unflattering or show bulges, while still appearing to have a close fit."
I broke my arm in August.  I cannot reach behind my back to fasten my bra.  This bra is perfect for me.
"Wow so soft ,comfortable,dry and vivid colors as seen here. Teenage Man could not wait to get his holey socks off and these on for warmth."
"I'll keep it short and simple. This scale is nice because its feels solid (mix of aluminum and plastic) and has large easy to read numbers. You can easily weigh small things like carry on baggage with one hand. When it comes to larger bags such as the ones you check in, it requires some work because you end up having to lift around 50 pounds in one hand off of the ground without touching anything else (like the side of your leg). Its tough but it can be done. Anyway, that's not the fault of this product, it is the form factor and you should be aware of it."
I like them but I've only wore them twice. Time will tell just how satisfied I am.
Thank you for an option for my son to chew on. His medical alert necklace was the victim until I bought this. It helps him concentrate.
"This bag, is perfectly made, sturdy quality, a bit stiff .. and I wish it was a bit larger, the only reason is I carry alot. But is perfect."
"I love them this is the 3 pair will be purchasing more!!!
As a worker in the medical field you need a good pair of scrubs and Maevn are it!!!"
I purchased this for my daughter's 4th birthday. She was so excited. It fit perfectly and was high quality.
I ordered two pairs when I saw they were on sale. I have a pair in black and have been waiting for a better price. They are very comfortable & I would recommend.
"I started interning at a financial firm a few months ago. At some days, we have to bring our laptops. I never actually had a laptop sleeve only a backpack that can carry a laptop, so I can never go with a backpack because it's not professional. I stumbled upon this and may I just say, what a great buy! The look is stunning in person! I've gotten so many compliments carrying this bag anywhere I go because it gives a really classic look. I carry my laptop and a few notebooks in here and I'm set. I don't use mine often so it's still a little stiff, but it's not a problem to me because I'm trying to keep this for a long time. I recommended it to some of my coworkers and I would buy it as presents if ever."
"Good Jacket, adequately warm, numerous pockets. Great value especially for the price."
"The jeans is true size I've ordered 34x30 and it fit as expected.
It is Italian version. Quality is good. no issues were found"
"Love these shirts! I wear these under my clothes for extra coverage and they do a great job. I am a B cup, and these shirts offer great coverage and freedom of movement. I own 14!"
These are even prettier in person! Very pleased! 
My daughter loves it! Shes second skechers and second air memory foam sole comfort and light
These luttle suits are well made and look great on my grandsons .  I ordered them for my 2 and 4 year old grandsons to wear at our wedding renewal ceremony.
These are a little looser than I expected.
this was super cute in miami! careful when relaxing on the beach- you might have a nip slip. fit as expected and good butt coverage! i bought some blue fitness tape to keep the girls in and up!
"I am 5'9/5'10 and 129 lbs, and a 32 D cup so finding a 1 piece for me is nearly impossible however I was pleasantly surprised to see this fit without becoming a thong on me! I may have to change the cups out for thicker cups to have a little more cleavage but I would definitely recommend this suit bc of the quality as well"
"I got this shirt in 3 colors and really like them, soft comfortable fabric and pretty colors and they fit well"
"Quick service, love it!"
I adore these boots! I have worn the death out of them already. They are my new go to. I am looking to buy them in stone; I have black.
Stayed on and secure! Much better than the more expensive tag I also purchased.
"Bought this for my husband for our upcoming trip to Maui and it is a wonderful shirt.  He loves it!  It's very soft and fits nicely and the design is fun, but not gaudy or over-the-top.  It's perfect!!"
Love the colors and pattern on these glasses! They tint is perfect and keeps the sun filtered amazingly. I have been complimented several times wearing these beautiful glasses and the shape and style is awesome! I purchased this product at a discount for my honest review!
"My two year old is recently into pirates so I ordered this for him for Halloween this year. He is 2.5 now and on the smaller side, but it fits OK. I'll have to safety pin the pants tighter probably. He tried it on and the cuteness almost killed me. He loved it. He started running around saying ""Arrrg!"" I think he will probably even use it for play after Halloween is over."
This is as comfortable and firm as expected. My wife has been using it for the past 3 months now. She loves it over and over again. Firm and comfortable for her. She wants me to get more. I recommend it. Thumb up!!!
"I purchased the 'Always my daughter, forever my friend necklace as a gift for my daughter. She loves it. The packaging was wonderful. A very nice piece of jewelry."
Love reef flip flops! These are super pretty and comfy. The band isn't too tight like other flip flops that can rub.
WONDERFUL RING. GREAT QUALITY. KEEP UP THE GREAT STANDARDS. I'M GETTING FANTASTIC COMPLIMENTS.
~Received this costume today~Very beautiful and good Quality~The fit is great~Prompt shipment~So pleased with this purchase~Head piece is also nice~THANK YOU!!
I love Bob Ross.
Sexy and fun! Fits great. Easy way to spice things up!!!
Perfect! Very slimming :)
Good! Barely feels like you're wearing anything.
I really like these super comfortable clogs.  They seem to run a bit large and wide but I am sure that I will appreciate the extra room when I wear them with my warm wool socks.  They absorb shock very well and are comfortable enough to wear all day.  Arch support is great as well.
just what my 8 year old wanted for tye dying eorked great
Wedding must have!
I bought this to go to the Moulin Rouge in Paris and I was not disappointed in it. It fit perfect and it was very flattering on me.
"Love this wig super cute no problems it came styled I would buy again, it was a great hit at the costume party.
I did have to cut the bangs a bit"
"Quality is good, but a little large for most men and a little too masculine for most women"
ok so I love these bras that's why I bought 4 of them.
Nice shoes. Fit is true to size. Has worn numerous times and no complaints.
I bought this bracelet for my son a year ago. He still wears it.
"I like this, however, it is a little too pink. I was hoping for more of a maroon-ish color!"
"Super soft, cute socks. Great to sleep in!"
i didn't wear it but it looked good
Shipped fast Wonderful totally adjustable slipper/shoes. Great!
Absolutely adorable!  High quality.  Just a bit small.
Love these socks!  So comfy since they are all cotton and won't snag the baby's clothes or anyone who is holding the baby.  I have these in black also.  Such a wardrobe staple for any stylish little lady :)
Well made. Pretty color. Good price.
This owl necklace is much better than I ever expected for the price. The value is unbeatable. Will order again.
It's a perfect fit and super comfy. I love it.
very dressy looking
Fits my son well. Easy for him to put on. They look great.
Very pretty and well-made chain
Love this set. This is my favorite lounging after a long day attire. I trust Nautica to be well made and of good quality. This is great quality. I just wish the pocket was a side pocked and not a rear pocket.  But I can live with that. So comfortable and not to heavy.
"I bought this to wear to a Christmas show and it was absolutely perfect.

It came inside a nice little zippered plastic bag that was inside a box. I didn't use the included string, and was glad to see that it had some little combs in it, so I used those to attach it to my hair. I was also enthralled that I managed to buy 3 products that ended up being the exact same shade of red, so that was nice. Its a true red.

The hat stayed on all night, and I had no issues with it. Once I set the mesh in place it didn't move around or get in my eyes, so that is a huge plus. For anyone asking its a MUXXN dress."
Arrived on time. Fits good and looks good
Exceeded expectations. Well made looks like picture size fit nicely.
This top is very nice. It has a lot of spandex in it to give it a lot of stretch where I need it most. Great product.
"Ordered these for my daughters to supplement the ones that they have worn nearly every day for the past FIVE YEARS, including through the rains in Europe and Northern California.  I was reluctant to pay that much for sandals years ago, but not now!, THERE ARE NONE BETTER!  Comfortable and last forever; they're still wearing the old ones too!"
"These are my first black tennis shoes and I just love them! Very comfortable, great fit, and the little splashes of color are just enough to add some really cute style to the shoes. I get so many compliments when I wear them."
I followed the size questionnaire and picked a half size smaller than I usually wear and the shoes fit good with 1.2 inch of room at toes which I always want.
"Love this shoe. It really is all terrain. Asphalt, dirt, leaves, mud, rocks, etc. Very comfortable that provides secure footing."
"When you consider the cost, and that it is solar (never needing a battery changed), this Casio men's watch fit the bill for a watch that will not rust or discolor in the summer should I sweat a lot with it, as it is all non-metallic other than the stainless steel on the back of the watch itself.  Just what I was looking for and, even though it is fall in the air here in SC during December, I have enjoyed this quite a bit."
"The material is slippery and light, like a bathing suit. If you don't like tight clothes, order a size up to avoid discomfort. I'm usually a 2x, so I ordered a 3x and I'm happy with it. The dress is cute and fun to wear. I got what I expected!"
"wasn't sure if hubby would like this ...but he does, nice to have separate place for drivers id ...money clip is magnetic and holds bills securely!"
me encanto.!!
"I really like this Tunic, but it is too small.  I am going to return and reorder a larger size.  It really does run alot smaller so order larger than what you normally wear."
Neat socks
"Just as I expected!  I like the shirt a lot.  It is cheaply made though, and the cuts on the shoulders and neck are not sewn, just cut so I hope it will survive when I wash it.  Overall happy with the shirt though."
"Not for wearing everyday, at least not for me.  A bit heavy on the arm but not uncomfortable.  Pretty and it keeps the time.  I think the silver colored one would be prettier because you would see the detail in the filigree better."
Love it! Bought 2 more
the shirt is so high quality I would pay the 12$ just for the shirt. the softest shirt I own now. thanks pact.
"Very cool, great safety gift that doesn't scream ""my parents dressed me alert"". The lighted portion isn't blinding bright but bright enough for walking at night and warning traffic for sure. Others might want that super saturated brightness they can read by, this is not that. The cloth material is basic thin hoodie material, nothing fancy at all but decent. The inside semi-hidden pocket that holds the battery case is a nice touch. Overall I'd say it's a lot more expensive than the materials warrant but still a great gift. Wish it had an auto-off timer set at around an hour or so, I predict this will eat batteries in the hands of kids who hang them up at school and forget to turn them off. Would be 5 stars but for the price."
"Price is right, size is right, very functional (needed to expand some nursing bras)"
"I'm pretty petite but based on the reviews I ordered a large- I probably didn't have to go THAT big. (I'm 5 ft tall, 115 lbs & pretty fit but somewhat larger in the chest area) I would have been better off with a medium. A couple of the snaps broke off right away but for the money I was expecting multiple seasons out of it.  It was cute & served the purpose. Overall, for the money it was decent."
"These are great shoes. They seem to stand up a bit better then some of the other brands we've gone through and fit true to size. The colors are as pictures (if anything, the orange is even more vivid on the pair we received) and my son loves his ""fast shoes."" The fact that they come in wide sizes is a bonus for my boys and their flipper-like feet as well."
"I am happy with this order. I have a big head, the prismatic cap with XL size fits my head perfectly. It looks great, the blue color is very brigh and the liner is soft and cozy. I bought for cold weather running, because I am at Los Angeles now, I have not tested it in cold weather yet, but seems good. the gore tex fabric is totally waterproof and windproof, it's a good gear for cold , snow or rainy day."
My old Seiko got wet and it would cost more to repair than replace.  I bought this and it is great.
"Great length, hits right above the knees. I love the fabric, very soft and comfortable. The dress runs slightly small but the fabric has some give so its not te end of the world. I am very happy with it."
My 9 year old wears it for fastpitch softball. Works great.
"Very nice, I love"
"This coat is actually quite nice for the price. I searched high and low at local stores to find a nice winter coat that didn't look like it was swallowing me. The smalls in stores were not small enough, so I took to the internet. After reading all of the reviews about how tiny this coat was, I got scared and ordered a medium for fear a small would be too small. I got it and tried it on. Too big. I also noticed that some of the button holes were sewn shut (or rather the hole was never cut out?). I sent it back and got the small, perfect fit! For reference I am 53 and ~107 pounds. I needed a long coat to brave a week in Denver weather, which ended up getting down to -13 some days. It was very warm, and I loved having the hood to keep the snow and wind off my head. I get a lot of compliments on it so all in all it was a good purchase!"
"My mom loved them, super comfy"
"I purchased these for my step-daughter for Christmas.  She loves them, however there was a tiny bit of glue on one of the boots when they arrived.  I am not sure how the glue got on the boot.  It is not in a noticeable spot, just aggravating that they weren't perfect for the price...."
Beautiful color. Washes nicely (sweet potato and pomegranate have both washed out with minimal special handling). Fit is true-to-brand.
"Very pretty, one of a kind earrings.  I love them."
Love the extra room in the seat!
I love penguins and this is the perfect necklace for me. It is so cute.
"These flip flops are great!!!! Way more comfortable and more durable than Havaianas. They run about 1-1.5 sizes small though. I usually wear a 6.5-7 and the 7 was way too small. The 8 is perfect. They are very narrow though, which works for me. If you have wide feet they probably won't fit very well. For instance, regular Havaianas  (not the slim fit) were always way too wide for foot foot and these are great. If your foot fits the  Havainas these may not work."
My husband is enjoying his cap
"I wore these to both Spartan races that I participated in last year, 1 Super and 1 Beast. The traction was incredible, this was especially noticeable on the downhill sections of the courses. The biggest complaint that I had was the lack of water drainage, little puddles weren't a concern but the swimming obstacles filled the shoe which caused a squish squash sound for the next mile or so. Honestly even with the retention of the water these were hands down 110% better than any previous shoe Ive worn.  The traction was just far superior than any other shoe Ive worn and the protector thing over the tongue kept out all course debris. This was a major issue for me during previous races.

So in conclusion.
Pros:
Good Fit
Great traction especially downhill
Clean toe box (no course debris)
Quick lace system

Cons:
Does not drain water too quickly"
Seems Ok for the price. Quality seems good.
"Love these! My family loves elephants- and now my cousins, sisters, mom, and I all own these bracelets!"
The pants are cute. I know they are leggings but they are really tight. They also have a pink written tag that shows through the back but overall good product.
These run small but this is still a lovely top. Many compliments.
Gave it to my brother for Christmas. He loves it and says he has gotten many compliments.
these are for my husband  he is a diebeic  that is why I got these shoes he likes  them sofor thanks marlene shaw
Very flattering dress. I'm a quite busty though so I will be sewing a little bralette into it.
"Great, multi-purpose tote"
super comfy - i could sleep in these.
"great for Swimming been using it for about a month or so and it doesn't make you feel heavier when getting out of the water. Also it drys up pretty quick. Will buy again.. wanted something to wear since i wasn't feeling to confident to go shirtless in the pool..
** Great for pool training and the beach
** True to size
*** Great material (somewhat like under amour)
**** Great for the $$$
****** Drys quick
At the moment I have No Cons for the shirt."
Cute sunglasses. Comfortable to wear.
Great fun bracelet to wear and very versatile. The girlies seem to like it a lot so you can't go wrong with that. I likey!
The little metal effect on the laces makes the shoes different than other combat-y boots. This is my second or third pair of Alegrias and I love them for the comfort & style. What more can you ask of a shoe or boot?
Theeeee sexiest! This will make any plus size woman feel and look like a million bucks.
"Really cute sun hat, love the wire brim, easily moldable, love that the have a tie above the brim so you can tighten it if need be. Awesome value!!"
"The boot is beautiful and comfortable, but if you're short (I'm 5'3""), it'll fit higher on your leg.  To me it seems like 2"" too high. It hits my knee, and it looks weird because it flares out a bit at my knee as opposed to the thickest part of my calf. (Hope that makes sense).  Sadly, returning. I'm only taking off a star because it's not the boots' fault that I'm short :)"
"a little big shirt, but it is justified by the style. bought the second. good quality."
"I personally like this tank top. It mostly fits true to size or just a tad large. You have to remember that it is not a miracle shirt and you're not going to look 10 sizes smaller, but if you have some ""flab"" it does hold you in place. It will make you feel better and less conscious about yourself."
enjoy saucony
"It's better looking that it appears on this picture, size runs true and very comfortable, also good for wearing it to work."
"I bought these on a whim to add to my nursing shoes collection. I read in the reviews that they run small so I ordered a whole size up from my usual 10 to an 11 (they don't sell 10.5) and the length was perfect. Unfortunately it was too narrow towards the toes, and there is a seam that rubs against the side of my foot just before my toes. I do have slightly wide feet, but I've never actually needed to order wide shoes, so it's safe to assume these are just exceptionally narrow. Other than the fit, I wasn't crazy about how they looked. They look like gray bowling shoes to me. I will say that I like the elastic shoelace design, the sole feels insanely comfortable, the material looks easy to clean/disinfect and they're a nice alternative to the standard nursing clog. I'll be returning these due to the improper fit, but I will surely try out other Nurse Mates shoes.

I gave 4 stars out of 5 because I do believe that the quality is good and they'll make someone else very happy, but just not for me."
"shorter and baggier than the image led me to believe it would be, but still very cute shirt."
They are cute and love that they come in black.
Great quality and great fit.  Very cute!
"Was very unsure after reading reviews if to ordery size, normally wear a 6.5 and oddly enough one foot is slightly wider, went with 6.5 and fit perfectly very comfortable and light, great fory workouts or just running around town, color contrast of grey and teal look great, functional and bit Back to Future...esk...but no laces are great...."
"I hope DVS sells these forever. I'd buy the same pair over and over. The quality, clean design, pricing, and comfort is perfect."
"If you are Misses/ Women's, size up. Fits snug on curves."
Very warm! It was -24 (with wind chill) in Wyoming and kept my head warm.
"Love the look on a women's  face when she realizes that it is the ""Grey"" tie. Quality stitching and at a bargain price."
Order due to a sick foot. I use insole in left shoes they worked great and I even received compliments on them.
I bought this for my dad as a gift. He told me which size he wanted and it turned out to be too small. I'm not sure if he was bigger than he thought or the shorts were smaller than expected haha. But he got the same one's a size up and they look and fit great.
"Cute but very small, the lid does not stay open as shown though.  Color is nice aqua"
"Awesome product, awesome experience."
I purchased this watch for my brother as a Christmas gift. He has young children and I thought it would be a nice thing for him to pass down. His 1 1/2 year old son liked it so much he wouldn't let go of it. When my husband saw it I had to order him one too :) Definitely a hit with the guys.
"Feels a little cheaply made, as though it'll break if I wear it often."
"I purchased this as a gift for someone and they absolutely loved it. I had it shipped to me and repackaged it myself to put in a gift basket and when I saw it, I thought it was absolutely gorgeous. Great quality. I love the missing puzzle piece as the way it hangs on the chain, it's a lovely touch. I didn't care much personally for the chain because it reminded me of my dog tags, so I included another chain when I sent it as a gift. I'm not sure which chain was the recipient's choice. But the chain did appear to be of good quality, no complaints about that."
Would love to find this in sterling silver! I love the design
"They are very flattering. I've got the narrow sole, and it worked perfectly. If you have problems finding a pair of shoes which is not too large, you'll love this."
"My biggest worry when ordering was whether they would be true to size or run a bit small based on some of the other reviews I had read. I was glad to find that they fit my size 12 feet perfectly and I would say they are true to size. They are also very light and although the upper material does seem a bit fragile, I plan on these being my indoor workout shoes for the next 6-12 months and I think they will hold up well in that role. Despite the zig zag pattern it doesn't create any feeling on the bottom of my foot that there is presuure only where the zig zags attach to the sole. Overall very light weight, comfortable, good looking (at least I think so and I got the orange and silver pair), and true to size."
"These are now my favorite boots! I'm 5'8"" with a 31"" inseam and they hit right at the kneecap. With 15"" calves they are fitted enough to look slimming, but leave enough space that the top doesn't touch the skin at all. The leather is high quality and quite soft on the inside. I was very impressed at the craftsmanship and fitting of the boot; it's nice to see such an elegant style from Ariat. The detailing is particularly beautiful (I get compliments everywhere I go), though it should be noted that it's more of a cream than white."
"Feel great on my feet. The big toe is somewhat awkward and did bother me occasionally. That being said it held up in a bike ride, walking and running"
"My daughter's worn these when we've walked 10+ miles without compliant, so they are comfortable and seem to offer good support.

I am a fan of Saucony, and she says these are very comfortable so we kept them, but I'd order up to ensure you get a reasonable amount of use from them.  Bought for my 7 year-old daughter who wears a size 2 or 2.5 shoe.  These fit her right now, but only just barely (versus a pair of Reebok shoes we also bought in a size 2.5 which fit with room).  Colors are vibrant but not obnoxious."
Works great as advertised.
"I liked these in Berry so much, that I ordered another pair in Navy. They are great for knocking around the yard and walking the dog after the rains, when everything is still wet and muddy. I wear a size 6, and although a 6 did fit, I prefer the roominess of the 7. Allows me to wear a heavier sock (the boots are not insulated) and makes them easier to slip on and off. So, as others have stated they do run small for a rainboot. But so far I am happy with the style, fit, sturdiness, waterproofness and quality. Oh! You can also send them back to the manufacturer for recycling if you wear them out, so bonus points for being Earth conscious! I'm anxiously awaiting some more color combinations....red?! Light blue with black sole?"
"Great find, great buy.  I want more colors!"
Always a great supportive of fit!
Excellent bag nice size and has many compartments not to bulky but stores alot
This was a gift and the recipient loved them.
Beautiful! Just as the picture shows!!
I have returned these shoes in exchange for 7 W- I think these will fit-The shoes are well made and are just what I wanted-I have been so disappointed in the past with shoes that hurt that I over- compensated and ordered WW - Can't wait for my replacements to arrive.
I love these but can't wear them because they fly off my feet while I'm walking.
The kid loves it. It held up well after one training session.
beautiful material great price but runs large
"I am 5 5"" and at the time I brought this shirt I was 189 pounds, I am also a 40 DDD.  I got the X-large and it fit real nice"
Like the color. Looks cute on me... The man thought so too... *wink*
Just wonderful.  Works perfectly.  Getting another pair.
"As other reviews have said, not only is the brim petite, but so is the hat size itself. I have a smaller hat size and finding something that fits without modifying it is difficult. This is a perfect fit. Rolls up into a decent size for packing and bounces back to it's normal shape easily. Will definitely be my go to hat from now on."
Beautiful shoes and color.
Buy. Them!!!
Absolutely amazing!! Very impressive!! well-built
"I am 5'6"" 154lbs,big hips and butt and ordered the Through the Looking Glass, and Alice in Wonderland leggings. The One Size fits great! The colors aren't as vivid as in the picture, but I prefer it that way. It's more like the book illustrations. It's a nice spandex like material and not sheer at all. I read reviews from other sellers and glad I choose Slick Blue. They were cheaper and better material."
"Great price, heavy weight and comfortable.  This is my first pair of Key jeans and I like them.  Will be ordering more for sure."
Husband wishes the pockets were deeper!
Took is from the east coast to the west coast and back!  Great bag!  The color is great too! Super buy.
"I got these b/c I refuse to where crocs.  They fit perfectly, are very comfortable and do exactly what I was after."
"Awesome shoes, very comfortable.....  Order a half size larger than you usually wear and they will be perfect!  Great shoes!"
This brand is comfortable and durable.  It fits true to size.  My daughter really likes these.
You just can't fail with Easy Spirit Traveltime ~ it's my third pair and well worth every penny!
These are amazing. I bought them to wear under dresses to prevent the dreaded thigh rub. They are perfect. Thin so they're not bulky. Not too tight to produce lumps and not too loose to ride up or fall down. Excellent product.
"ME: 5'10"", 220 lbs, 36DDD, dress size 14

FIT: I really love the fit of this blazer! I was concerned about it being an open front but I feel like it hits me in all the correct spots & it stays in place as I move around. I'm tall & thus have longer arms so long sleeves are always an issue for me. I was curious about the idea of the ""rolled sleeve"" look with 3/4 sleeves. I feel like they hit me in an awkward spot but they are 3/4 sleeves & I'm just not used to them. They look more professional than they appear in the poor quality product photo. I LOVE the fit! It looks tailored & professional.

SIZING: I read SO. MANY. REVIEWS. They're all so mixed! I decided to just go off the reviews that posted photos so I could see for myself how it fit each person & what they said about it. As well as measuring my shoulder width & using the chart. I decided to go with my normal top size of XL. I think it fits beautifully. If I went smaller it'd probably lay weird because of the open design & my large chest. If I went bigger it'd probably look very frumpy on me. I think the size & fit is perfect. True to size in my opinion.

QUALITY: Compared to my suit jacket from The Limited, this is not a high quality blazer. However, I would not say it is of poor quality. All the seams appear to be intact, no loose sewing jobs anywhere that I could find. Believe me, I looked. When looking closely at the material, you can tell it's not a typical suit material. However, if you're just wearing this for an interview or around the office, I don't think anyone will notice it's not of true suit quality. the lining seems a little iffy. I think if it were perhaps a darker color or of a different pattern it'd look better than it does.

VALUE: For a $25 blazer, it's a great value! I have an upcoming interview & am in no position financially to go purchasing another the Limited suit jacket for $80! My old one is just too small & uncomfortable to wear anymore. This was a great quick fix option for me & I won't have to stress over money because of this last minute purchase. Honestly, I may purchase another one as a back up.

OVERALL: I am very happy & pleasantly surprised with this purchase. I was very leery of purchasing this blazer because lets face it. Buying clothes on Amazon is a gamble. There are so many imitation sellers & the main photo for this product is blurry &&& it is also being used to represent the same product from 3 or 4 other sellers that I found. I went with this seller purely because it has a very high number of reviews & thankfully those reviews chose to post pictures to back up their review! I'm very excited that this purchase surpassed, although low, expectations! This blazer appears professional & would make a great addition to the wardrobe of the many professional business women out there!"
Very nicely made.  I just wish the men in my family really needed/use it.  I bought 3.  Takes up to much space.
"They run small, but mine fit when I accounted for this.

I've had 4 pairs of these snake bootlets.
People love the fashion, and I love being an extra inch taller.

Snake skin dries out and is thin.  These last about a year
before the heels fall apart.  If you use shoe trees and oil
the skin they will look brand new when the heel finally
fails.  If you don't oil/polish and dry them they will start
peeling and look terrible at the end of that year.

I learned a lot about maintaining shoes from having these.
I bet I can get 2 years out of a few pairs now that I'm
maintaining them."
"these shoes are awesome! just a few sizes too big for my son, so I exchanged them for two sizes smaller. my son is so excited to wear them for his first day of first grade!"
"These are so comfortable and I wear them just about every day. Love that they are adjustable, will definitely be ordering more when I need to."
great looking dress shoe
"I purchased these sandals knowing the quality would be great (Hello, they are Frye).  I received them quickly from the seller and the length fit perfectly.  They are comfortable and I can wear them all day without any pain.  The only downside is that the ankle cradle does not secure your foot snug to the sole.  I have skinny ankles and while the ankle strap fit just fine, my foot would pull up about an inch with each step.  I would like it if they could improve the strap to secure your foot into the sole of the shoe.  Other than that, they are great quality.  The color is a great neutral that should match almost everything.  I am looking forward to these lasting all summer."
Great deal & I always get compliments.
"The leather is thick and oiled - looks tough on, but still feminine. I originally got these a half size up after reading reviews but I felt that they looked too big and there was excess toe room. So I returned the 8's for my usual size 7.5, it is VERY hard to get them on, but once they're on they feel great - perfect fit. I use the plastic bag trick to get them on, and I'm sure in time the leather will mold to my feet and I won't have to struggle to get them on. As for the calf fit, they hug my legs (I have a muscular build), but again I'm sure in time the leather will relax a little. These boots look like they are going to last a long time."
"Love the style, fits well. Belt is a little long but can easily be fixed."
The pants are great overall. When first unpacked they are stiff and rough. A couple of washings takes care of that. This factor will not stop me from ordering more pairs.
"A good looking, functional lunch bag.  It opens from the side and is very spacious (I can fit 2 good size plastic containers inside).  I'm glad I purchased this."
"I have become a Merino Wool evangelist. If you can buy it in ONLY MERINO wool try it. It will be expensive compared to the other clothing item you considered and it will be worth every every every penny. Caveat. If its doesn't explicitly  state ""merino wool"" specifically then don't buy it. The difference between merino and all other wools is so large they shouldn't even be in the same category. A must for those who sweat. Research merino wool you'll be impressed. Minus33 is one of the better brands"
"I love these shoes!  Initially ordered the white ones and then ordered the sand color.  Both colors fit exactly the same.  Today I'm getting the black pair.  They are very comfortable, fairly stylish, and hide a bunion.  For me they are perfect!"
This is the 5th pair I have bought and this is the first pair that is a little narrow at the ball of the foot.  I don't think the material is the same quality as before either.  That being said though I love the support Teva offers.
Love the feel of the shorts.  Just be careful when going commando and bending over for all to see!
This was for a 10 year old granddaughter who actually wanted a purple umbrella.  It was perfect.  She likes it very much as it has a very festive look.
my girl loves it and so do i ....Great buy for the $$
"Love, Love, Love this piece! Very expensive looking! Bought the band to match!"
"Pretty ring; nice style.  Unfortunately, the color is not as green as I would have liked.  Really can't tell it is green at all."
Great sandle. Comfort and ease.  No problem so far. Wore them all afternoon.  Really like these.
Really like it but the clasp can come undone as other reviews have stated. Wearing it with a Hand-made Brown Braided Leather Bracelet Multi-strand Genuine Leather Wristband Wrap Bracelet keeps it between my wrist and hand and doesn't give enough slack for the clasp to come undone very easily.
Love this shoe maker and these shoes!
Great wallet. Leather is awesome. Quality is fantastic. Color is vibrant and has great storage.
"At the upper size end, these run very long so I returned the first pair in favor of a size smaller yielding a perfect fit.  The instep strap was a bit tight so I wet it and wore it so it stretched a little bit.  The result is perfect fit.  The sole has a high arch which feels great and the shoe doesn't move around much at all--unusual for this type of sandal.  Great shoe and would buy again!"
Love love love the design however this item runs sonewhat small I just made it in because the material strech it made my Bidy look even fuller. I have a rounded body with butt and hips so If u a size large ladies go a size bigger.
I luv these shirts I babysit my granddaughter if she gets food on them or anything else  it washes right off
Love these shoes. I have several pair.
My husband loves this hat. Looks great & fits perfectly.
I really don't know how these fit I bought then to give to a young girl as part of a Giving Tree gift for Christmas.
sizing of pockets is not big enough for passport in a protective rfid sleeve. so i just used it in my luggage to store things i didn't carry in my clothes
Niceclooking
Love these soft socks!
"I love these shoes.  This pair is a replacement for a pair that I bought and used for the past year.  No 'break-in' time whatsoever.  While there is no arch support per se, my feet never hurt nor tire while wearing them."
"This review is for the a line skirt pictured. I received the product in a very timely manner and the product was in good condition. It looke somewhat more like a slip at first, but when I put the item on it was more of a thin skirt

The design was adequate for an individual of short stature such as I am 5'3"". I would not however recommend this item for anyone who may be taller unless you desire a mini skirt it is that short. The lace design that is shown in one of the pictures is a fairly nice lace overlay to the lining. Overall it is a nice product for a petite individual if you are of average height I would pass.

I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review"
"Good fit, simple design but durable and works great."
Super super cute! The grip was fantastic and kept my daughter from slipping. Would buy the next size up if they had it !
Love this Roxy Board shorts as the top portion is very stretchy and can be folded down or adjusted to fit your coverage needs. I highly recommend these to moms especially! Perfect for providing the perfect amount of coverage and overall extremely comfortable.
Very nice cross. Smooth and polished nicely. - Matches the Back carbon inlay ring. - Delivery was pretty quick too.
Finally heels that won't give me bunions in my old age! Wide and comfy.
I love these shoes. They are so comfortable and cute on!
"This is a beautiful statement necklace. Lovely, eye catching crystals and a nice sized collar so it hangs well. This looks very expensive on, and I have received many compliments on it. Highly recommend, especially for upcoming holidays."
Cute but still age appropriate
"Very cute, wearing with my snow white costume, perfect!  True to size, comfortable."
The gloves are great. Keep me warm during PT in the freezing cold and feel good for normal day wear.
So soft.  You can feel the quality.  Highly recommend
Great replacement wedding until I find the one I lost. I've literally had this for 4 months and it still looks great and I never take it off and wear it everywhere. I was expecting it to turn silver after a few months but so far so good. I'll post again after 1 year.
"I LOVE THIS DRESS SOOO MUCH! Fits perfect to me though it's a lil bit longer of my 5'1height but it doesn't matter the dress is very beautiful. Not just perfect for summer but I can also wear it in a party. I'm so pleased how beautiful this dress!

I received this in discounted price in exchange of my honest opinion about the product."
"I ALWAYS look at customer reviews to see what the product really is like. I am GLAD that most items I get I am satisfied with. Rarely am I disappointed, the shoes are awesome. I love the look and they feel great. They truly are comfy, I use them for everyday walking, running, working out at home and probably will use them for a new job. The right size, great comfort, nice look and super price!"
"This is much better than I could purchase in a retail store for the money.  It fits my husband great, and it is of high quality leather."
"Very comfortable and true to size. The color is awesome and goes well with my other running gear. I have struggled with other shoes ruining my toe nails, but not in these shoes. My feet feel awesome after running half marathons in these shoes."
"These have the high-end luxury look youve been searching for without the pain, physically and financially!
My friend bought these is a in store for $169... Need I say more?

 Arrived fast::.
 The fit is 100% true to size for medium feet.
 Narrow feet go a half size down.
 Priced to one-click buy!
 Glamorous!
 Very well packaged by the seller.
 They even include a rose  how thoughtful!
 Will absolutely be ordering more comfy heels from this customer-centric seller!

Just received the 3 strap. It has a higher picture as you will see in the last picture side by side these. The straps are not consistent than this model. Id chose this model over the oddly crafted 3 strap any day.

They are so great I was able to ride my beach cruiser in these heels. Crazy, but they are THAT comfortable!

Here is a link to my all-time favorite heels so similar to this pair. Buy a half size up :)

THIS IS A FIVE . ANY HELLO KITTY STUFF IS GREAT THIS WALLET IS SKINNY AND JUST MY SIZE!! I SMILE EVERYTIME I USE IT EVERYDAY!!
"Amazing dress, if you are worried to ""show off"" a bandeau bra top is great. Go for some platform ""Timberland"" like nude and brown shoes with a pair of nude original fishnet stockings and call it a HIT!"
"I was very pleased with this wig and got quite a few compliments for our 80's themed Halloween party.  My only complaint is that this wig sheds some of its hair!  Yes, I kept finding long pieces of black hair on my top.  Still, it was a cute wig and my costume turned out great."
great quality and very cute!  our toddler is a huge fan of PeekAZoo.  make cute presents too!
"Great pair of capris for the price.  I'd buy another pair in a different color, that's for sure."
The T-Shirt is made very well and is slightly more form fitting than I originally thought.  My wife loves it on me so I'm not complaining!
It's a pocket t-shirt
Keeps my watches in place for me. I recommend
"I got the small size, because I wanted a skin-tight fit. I was down buying some beer and out of the blue, the store clerk(female) told me that I should seriously consider becoming a model. Along with a few other encounters which would be redundant to mention, I must say that the power of this shirt is not to be underestimated."
"I bought it for his birthday. Big Street Fighter fan, & we went out once, & people complimented it. It's great when people recognize icons like this, but they have to look twice. lol"
"I love Baggallinis. This large wallet bag is the best. I needed to pare down what I carry with me in my purse because lugging 10 pounds on my shoulder is not a good thing. So when I saw this Baggallini on a friend of mine I realized that this was just the size I needed. This bag is made to strap across your chest and not to be hung on your shoulder, although you could carry it that way. It is perfect for shopping because it keeps your hands and arms free as it hangs from your body. It is large enough to put wallet, cell phone, makeup and check book in but not large enough to carry a kindle, water, etc, which is what I did with my larger bag. So if you want to travel lighter this is the bag for you."
Way better than I expected and all around solid watch.
I absolutely love this wallet! It looks so pretty! The leather is high quality. The size is just perfect too! Great price
"Sizing is good, nice length, washed twice, looks good did not seem to shrink much."
I have ordered and worn this shoe for over 20 years.  The last fits my foot and it is very comfortable.
Love this shirt....very comfortable!
"Tights are always too small.  Anyway, I like these.  They *are* almost blackout except up near the thighs."
"These are the best brand of sneakers for babies and toddlers.  They sre light weight, provide excellent support with a good sized toe box.  I have purchased a number of these sneakers and have never been disappointed.  The
Grandchildren have outgrown them before they have been worn out.  They also clean up nicely in the washing machine.  I generally wash them with s couple of towels.  I would highly recommend these sneakers.  If you can find them on sale- even better!"
I love this brand and style.  And these go perfectly with my jeans!  Great for the price too
Love them.  fit better then expected
"Finally, a lab coat that fits to size!  That alone deserves the full five stars!  The material is medium weight, and the coat overall seems well stitched, though only time will tell on that."
I purchased this set for my mother. The pants were a bit on the small side while the top was huge. Overall though she likes them
First long day of wearing I did get blisters on the side of my ankles but no a problem now.  They were comfortable all day minus the blisters and I can now were them for several hours with no problems at all.  Great for boats and other water related activities. I believe they may run half a size large though.
I've worn these for over a year and they are still going strong. Very comfy
"I love this tiny wallet. Upon moving to Las Vegas, someone got a hold of my boyfriend credit card and charged $1200 to it. So we both got RFID blocking wallet to protect ourselves. This wallet is perfect for your essentials: ID, credit card/debits cards plus a little zipper for cash. Its small enough to fit in my front pocket too, because sometimes you don't want to carry around a purse, but you need your essentials. It would also be great for traveling."
"I have had other scales. This seems to be the best
Easy to handle and operate. Good hook size!"
It's HUGE ON MY 4 YR OLD
Looks great on my 19 yr old son. Nice clean look for jeans.
I have purchased a couple belts twice as expensive as this belt only to have them fray or the buckle break--the workmanship and materials were poor.  I took a chance on the arhart because the quality of their other products is very high.  I was not disappointed at all.  This is a great belt at a very fair price.
"This is the best price I've seen this watch. Did a lot of research on casio trek's and G-shocks. I had some must haves which included temperature and compass and wanted a watch with analog hands that presented a nice look and this was the model that fit the bill at a reasonable price. The features are simple enough to use, and there are some pretty advanced features if you want to dig that deep into it. I  do wish it had an atomic clock, but the price would have been much higher.

Finally, just a note on the picture. While the description does indeed say black, the pic makes it look a little more gunmetal in color. It is truly black and that was sort of upsetting to me, but I still like it."
"My first pair was the same size but a different color. I wasn't able to find another  comparable shoe until I ran into this one in black. Black is much richer looking than the lighter color.  These slip-ins are comfortable, even when wearing for long periods. They are built to be wearable for most activities, yet are comfortable enough to wear around the house as slippers."
These fit just as expected. Look great and perfect length for men.
I just love my shoes.  I was looking for something sexy and I founded them in these shoes.
"Very sturdy, really classy."
My grandson likes  the U.S. Polo Assn. Henley grey with red trim shirt.  A nice look and a good fit.
"This hat seems to be fairly well made. The multi-colored flashing lights are insanely bright and flash quickly. The hat overall is very blingy, which means my daughter will probably love it when she gets it for her 5th birthday coming soon."
Great boat shoes
"The fabric is well made. The screen printing rivals the best I've seen; by any of my friends in the industry. The artistry is award winning says my wife, a signature member of the Society of Watercolor Artists. (sorry, had to brag a little)

Like the eagle protecting the skies for our flag, we need the vigilance of the wolf standing guard on our shores.

Veterans' Day is NOVEMBER 11th. They protected us, pay it forward by saying Thank You."
Good affordable pair of sport shorts.  Nice navy color to complemend school colors.  Great warm up short for wrestling or other sport.
"I wear a 7-1/2N, but was unable to purchase this size on this site. I settled for the 7-1/2M which is adequate, and I will wear it, although a narrow would have fit better. Too bad this Skechers does not come in this size."
"With use, the stitching falls out.  Not what I expected from a Stride Rite Product"
Perfect size for preschool kid.. love the fact that the front pocket is insulated for snacks or lunch.. wish it would had been a little wider but we will make it work..
"Bought these shorts in a size 8 for my 10-year-old son after reading the reviews.  They shorts are high quality and he loves the colors.  The only problem is that they are especially long.  Glad I read the reviews first and ordered a size smaller.  Even the size 8 is long, but he loves them and will be able to wear them for a couple years."
It looked great! My daughter wears a 10 normally and this fit very well.
I bought these for my husband who has wide large feet. He has a difficult time finding the proper size. These shoes will worth the money.
"I'm impressed by this jacket. I wasn't sure what to expect, but, having had it for two weeks now, I'm pleased overall.

The fit is quite good; it's snug.

The jacket is warmer than I expected. There's no padding except for a thin liner (no liner in the sleeves), but the leather keeps me fairly warm in temperatures from the mid-40s Fahrenheit to the mid-60s.

The left side has a glove-sized exterior pocket, but the right side only has a small pocket. There is an interior chest-level pocket on both sides.

It has a zipper, though it is a left-side zipper. The flap over the zipper is magnetic and does a good job keeping the jacket shut even without the zipper. It has a tendency to snap shut on me.

Most people don't recognize it as the Han Solo jacket; more than a few have assumed I'm a fan of Top Gear (apparently one of the people on that show wears a similar jacket). It's close enough to ""normal"" appearance that I can wear it out without being labeled as a science fiction geek, but the hardest fans recognize the jacket right off.

All in all, it's a steep price, but I'd say I got what I paid for. I'd recommend it."
"Only a 4 star because I need a narrow heeled shoe and these aren't.  Even so, I wear them all day gardening with socks."
"Super soft and comfortable.  It did ""shed"" on me the first time I wore it (lining), but no problems since."
"Purchased these for my husband who suffers from Raynaud's so he needs gloves that will actually keep his hands and fingers warm. These do a pretty good job of it and they are soft. I do not know that they would keep his fingers warm in -40 degrees Fahrenheit as it was about 30 above and he felt some cold. However, these have been his best experience with gloves keeping his hands warm and he is happy with them. He has large hands and I bought him an XL. They fit perfectly."
"I got these for my 8 year old who loves hiking.  He said they were comfortable, wore them hiking as soon as he got them with no need to break them in."
bigger than expected but beautiful
"I am so sad I had to return these shoes. I purchased these because I have another pair of Jambus and love them. I do have a wide foot, but my other Jambus still fit perfectly. these were too narrow in the toe area. I gave them 5 stars because they are good shoes. I would definitely purchase another pair I would just try on in the store. I will say the return was easy. I had all the original packaging. I just used the return slip that I printed up on line and dropped them off at the post office."
I bought this as a gift to go with navy colored pants. Love the clean lines. And it does not need ironing!
Purchased as a gift. Recipient was delighted. Good Product.
This is a cute dress and a steal for the price. The only downfall is that the white dress is pretty thin and you can easily see your undergarments. Otherwise it is cute and stylish!
"This material is soft and smooth, unlike woolen socks.  I like the three patterns and will look for more socks - knee highs, or not - by this maker. I read the reviews ahead of time and was nervous about the big toe wearing through too quickly. I haven't worn these yet, just tried them on, but I kept in mind about the toe and discovered that there's a metal clip holding the toes together. I wonder if the clip is what's causing the toe to wear out; if you don't see the clip and just tug the socks apart, it could be the start of a hole... and a toe would only make it bigger.  So, for now, before wearing, I'm saying these are good socks.  We'll see how I feel after a couple of wearings..."
Love them. They don't leak and are cool as hell
Superb quality! The price was unbeatable!
"What can be said about these great shoes! I must own 20 pair of Easy Spirit Traveltime. At my age, I really don't care what I pay for my shoes, makeup, as long as it works and lasts and makes me look fabulous. They run absolutely true to size, have amazing arch support, and with so many colors available - you just can't go wrong."
"Love these lightweight shoes.  Wish there were more styles with the black sole instead of white. I bought 2 different pairs. Be sure to go to a local shoe store to try on a couple of sizes like I did before ordering. I think they are true to size. Also, try on the Pro 4 like I did to see how much better the Pro 3 is."
Love this ski mask! Work on a very windy farm in winter time! It is very warm and very comfortable! Good 4 those cold winter days outside!...
"This is a great necklace that will go with almost anything. Its costume jewelry at its best, whether or not you're a Dr. Who fan."
"Good things first:
1- This dress is NOT made from some chintzy, stretchy, scratchy fabric like you'll find in your average Halloween costume. It's thick, durable, and made like something you're expected to wear for more than one night of a year.  I wouldn't call it ""breathable"" (my clothing choice is always cotton, and this is definitely some form of smooth polyester weave,) but it's comfortable to wear in average temperatures and stitched better than average.

2- The only thing you'll need is shoes! This set comes with a separate white under-blouse (complete with invisible side zipper,) white apron, sky blue ""jumper"" (also with side zip,) blue hair bow (mine came with an alligator clip,) and a some-assembly-required sheer hoop skirt (which I'll be using for some other costume as Belle's town dress was really not that full.)

3- The fit is true to size! I'm 5' 3"" and 135, and it fits like a glove. The hem falls somewhere around my shins-- not so long it drags the floor, not too short. The blouse might feel big-ish initially, but under the jumper it works just fine.

4- Mine arrived nearly a month ahead of the predicted date!

Now for a couple of minor cons.

1- While the stitching is better than some cheaper costumes, there are still places (most notably the blouse sleeves and the sheer fabric of the hoop skirt) where the stitches are off-centered or the threads are loose. Easily fixed if you have any knowledge of sewing, but for the price (I paid $60,) still somewhat bothersome.

2- The alligator clip in my hair bow was crushed on arrival. Easily replaced and I blame the shipping company, not the manufacturer, but you may want to have some bobby pins on hand for it.

3- The blouse does want to ride up under the jumper, almost as though it needs more bottom-weight to hold it down. Garter belt, anyone? The sleeves are also slightly large at the cuff, and I have thick forearms for a girl.

4- The white frill along the bottom of the dress is not screen-accurate, but if you're buying this, you probably don't care.

5- The hoop skirt is pretty darn cheap, and as you have to thread the plastic into the holes yourself after it's been coiled for weeks, getting it to lay as a hoop and not curl in on itself is going to be a real pain.

Over all, I would definitely buy this dress again-- budget permitting. You could easily spend just as much on fabric and accessories as buying this ready-made, above-par piece."
I got these slippers for my Husband. They are very nice & he likes them.
Very comfortable boots and stylish as well.
Very nice comfortable Clark shoes in a hard to find color and style
Absolutely amazing thing. Now we can go outside if it is rainy or mud all around. My 10 months old baby can do everything in it during rainy winter. Going to a playground after rain or having fun in the gurden is not a problem anymore. You have to understand that this thing most likely is not for a really heavy rain.
The costume was shipped quickly and was packaged very well. My daughter is 4 weighing around 45 lbs. She wears a small in girls (size 6). The costume fit her perfectly. I let her wear tights underneath because we had a bounce house. She did not need an undershirt. No sequence fell off. Everyone loved her outfit and it was still in great condition after her party. No complaints.
"Shinny and just the right thickness to the ring, love it"
Very comfortable and easy to fasten. Stayed fastened. No binding of digging.
Good quality and very handy.  I looked all over for a gym bag that would hold my drinks on the outside.  This is a good find.
Fit great and durable.
Looks just as described and a better price then at the store. There lightweight and very comfortable.
"I was looking for a decent compact umbrella and this is a really nice one for ten bucks!
Very happy."
Very soft. Drapes nicely.
Love crocs. Wish there were half sizes though.
"These shoes are fabulous!!!  They are very high quality and we get so many compliments on the style. They are Velcro, but have the big boy look of laces.  I ordered a matching set for my 5 year old and 2 year old.  They look so cute wearing them together!  They can both put them on by themselves, no problem...well, sometimes my 2 year old puts them on the wrong feet, but he can at least get them on & fastened!! :)  I HIGHLY recommend these shoes!!"
"I love the watch, I just wish I had noticed before hand that it didn't have a second hand."
"My husband loves these shoes! They are very comfortable. He does wish the soles were a color other than white, but that is about it. He really likes the insoles."
This dress fits very nicely and it the perfect length for me. (I'm 5' tall)
"I don't give 5 stars very often, but this is a great, well made bag.  my large and small water bottles fits wonderfully in the sides, the tied the straps so that they were shorter and more comfy to wear backpack style for my small frame.  fits lots of stuff and is decently comfy with heavy items.  decently water resistant.

I own the blue with the yellowish zips  i ordered the pink too, but it wasn't the pretty bright true dark pink in the picture, more of a magenta highlighter type pink, so i sent it back."
It fit perfect on my son.
"My husband love it! I have purchased them for 6 months now and they are still good, same shape, and no bumpy."
Lucky Jeans are probably the only jeans that are made true to size!  These do stretch a bit and get baggy but that's what a belt is for. Good quality. Worth the money.
Totally Awesome leggings! Super soft and very warm! You won't be sorry.
"so beautiful, just as described"
"I was really impressed when this purse arrived. It is a little bigger than I expected, which was nice, because although it's a clutch purse it will easily fit my phone, wallet, keys, gum and makeup with room to spare. There is one inside roomy pocket and the rest is open space. The zipper works smoothly and the whole purse seems put together very well. I'll be proud to carry this bag with a dressy or casual outfit, it's very versatile. I was able to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Perfect it fits perfectly right over the handle of my  big Delsey. I purchased my 26 inch at Sears the little one is  very  close to the same color.
Kinda nice for little girls. Very simple dress but nice
I Replaced my Detroit Syle with this one after 12 years. I really like the casual look and it is very warm. I wear it down to 30-32 then switch to my arctic temp for below that but it is very warm with the hood up. The only this is the hand pockets are shallow so you have to be mindful of your keys or whatever you keep in there.
"Have heard of Crocs for years, but never tried them till now. Am blown away at the comfort!!

Just bought my second pair (wore first out) They are the absolute best shoe of their kind!"
"These are amazing, I will now have to get them in every color. I was looking for footwear for an all day convention/expo that would still look professional. These are amazing!!!!"
Fit good. Look very nice.
"Works well, both to provide additional support for our soft luggage, and to help identify our suitcase in the airport."
This was so nice and worth much more than the bargain price I paid.
"I really like these and will be buying another pair.  Dickies seems to be the only women's pants that seems to get my shape right, others I have muffin flub hanging over the waistbelt just to make the waist fit. these are perfect and I feel I look less ""muffiny"""
Good boots. I've bought them in the past. This color is new to me.
Finally a pair that fits both regular and wide width.
"Keep in mind when ordering, I wear a wide width which was too big. Had to get a medium. So if you have a narrow foot the narrow might be too large. Other than that, Im wearing them now. Very comfortable and I recommend. This is my 2nd pair of Ros Hommersons shoes and wide width was too wide on both."
These are a nice mid weight glove. Perfect for wearing indoors while writing or typing. Easy to slip on my favorite winter gloves over them to run out for errands. Very satisfied!
"These Clarks are some of the most comfortable shoes I've worn. It's the main reason I buy them, aside from the excellent quality and the smart business casual look. I'm a big fan."
"Love this hoodie, it's really soft and warm, but it does run small. It's a bit of a weird fit, though. I'm 5'10"" and about 175 lbs. I usually wear a 12, and would buy a L normally. The XL zips but is still snug. The length is great (hits me at the hips, but the sleeves are SUPER long. Go a size up and be prepared to push the sleeves up."
"I wear a size 8 but ordered the 8.5 because I have wide feet. They have room to spare but that is what I wanted.  I can wear them all day long and not get sore feet, unlike many other boots I have purchased.
They look nice and are well made. I definitely recommend them for work or out and about."
Roomy fit but I wish it had pockets
I have not tried the socks on.  They are a gift.
Perfect and exactly what I was looking for- feel great even after wearing several hours!
"Super comfortable! The band isn't too tight, which is perfect"
Perfect denim skirt
"Careful with the zipper--if it catches, you can end up tearing the material. Otherwise, VERY nice sweater."
This case is so nice! Seems well built and fits my pair of large aviators. The long shipping time was definitely worth the wait.
It's so beautiful. I love the quality.
"I got the medium and I am 5'4 and around 130-135 depending on the day:)  I carry more weight in my bottom half and tend to be very self conscious with anything form fitting and this dress made me feel fantastic!  Unfortunately I had to return it, only because the party I planned on wearing it to was cancelled and I can't see myself wearing this anywhere outside of that, but I am hoping sometime in the future I can order it again for another occasion.  I can see this being extremely flattering on any figure.  It really accentuates curves and hides any issues that might make you uncomfortable.  Not to mention I am very weird about fabrics on my skin and this felt so comfortable!"
Looks as pictured.  It is just what you would think you were buying.
"Where to begin?  I am a huge fan of leather suspenders and have several pairs.  They are however all clip on and I am in the process of switching all of my pants over to the button suspenders.  The advert says that these are real leather.  From the look and feel I never would have guessed that.  At most, these are made of a thin layer of leather that has been embossed and glued to a backing material for strength.  Even the mustaches seem to be of the very soft material.  If you intend to wear these a handful of times as a fashion bit they should be fine.  But if you are planning on wearing these to work once a week or so I wouldn't plan on the lasting long.

As for the look of the braces, this is the part that was done well.  I did like the color, I got the red ones, and the buckled held in place throughout the day.  The color did not bleed, even as I went for a 2 mile walk in 95 degree heat.

My initial intention was to return them after the first day I wore them, but the more I think about the price I figure they might be good to keep around as a backup.  The straps themselves aren't any near the quality of my clip on leather braces, but they were also significantly more expensive.  I guess that's what I get for going cheap."
Got as a  for my grandson.
"It's my favorite thing... I'm going to get more. Amazing color, good fit, and desently put together"
"Inexpensive and perfect for a cover up. Decent quality, love the price. Will be buying more! Great basic open long sweater. I wear it to work a lot."
I love these fitflops.  They are super comfortable.  I highly recommend them.
"I received this item for free in order to write a review.
I ordered the green sweater dress. For me it is too short to wear as a dress, I have a couple of pairs of leggings that I plan on wearing with this cute dress! As soon as the weather turns I will wear this to work. i got green thinking out side the box for holidays. It has some lace and glitter on it, which means it will be great for a holiday party!
Watch my blog http://ericabarker.com for a full review with pictures!"
"The heel took me a little time to get used to but after a day I didn't even notice.
I wear either a 10WW, 10.5W or an 11.
These in the 11 were perfect - I can wear it with a trouser sock and they do not flip off my feet and I have enough room in cooler weather to wear with a regular sock.  Very comfortable and a nice appearance for work too."
"Lightweight, easy care. Perfect for summers."
"Great price, great fit, can wear with sports jacket and tie.  This pants work well.  Black or brown shoes.  Dockers, when they are on sale, are really a great buy."
Very cute.  Looked as expected.  Fit a little larger than expected.  Def would purchase again.
Love!!! Thin material great for hot weather. Super cute
I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter. She said the shoe was comfortable and if it just fine. She loved the multiple colors that Lit up.
"My daughter hates tight socks. It's the strangest quirk. I purchased these because her brand name size 5 socks were getting too tight for her. Hanes does NOT disappoint! These are not flimsy thin, they are really well made with no hanging strings or snags. They are very comfortable and fit her feet perfectly and have enough stretch that she will be able to wear them for a while. They are not too tight on her ankles and there are no marks left on her feet or ankles from them. . The colors are fun, bright, and my daughter loves the patterns. I will be purchasing more of these 6-packs as my daughter is now refusing to wear any other socks. Thank you, Hanes!"
"Square shape is unusual, but I have found that it fits better in my back pocket and is overall, thinner. Smaller wallets are a bit more of an annoyance when sitting for a long time  like a long drive. This one is less noticeable.

Cant say that I have any idea if the RF blocker feature works or not. Possibly related, I did inadvertently have it in my pocket when going through TSA metal detectors and it was setting it off. Would not have expected it to do that, but maybe the blocker tech has something to do with it.

Construction is lightweight, but seems to be holding up very well. Photo ID window is a bit tight and can be difficult to remove ID when needed."
My son liked it!!  Just what I was looking for...
This was the best dress i bought myself for homecoming  had so much fun and got so many compliments  thank you so much
"Great cover up!
Hides everything "
This shirt is very soft. The printed design in combination with the cut of the shirt is flattering for someone needing plus size. I get lots of compliments on it.
I really like Keen's shoes and have many pairs.  The shoe is fine but because my feet are wider my toes are pinched.  Overall a great shoe just be sure that your feet are not wide.
"I arrived in perfect condition, and it was what was expected."
"quite big for a kid, but was very nice."
"I've tried so many different maternity pants and finally found the brand that fits me and my body shape. I am a short, curvy girl that (pre-pregnancy) wore a 14/16 in petites and (sometimes) regulars. I have a 29.5"" to 30"" inseam. These pants are great in so many ways. The maternity panel fits cleanly and securely over my belly (which I think I prefer). I do have thicker thighs (I wear wide calf in knee high boots), but they hug my legs in a pleasing way. Fabric is a nice thickness. With my inseam, they are maybe half an inch too long on me, but in shoes they just barely touch the ground. Just having pants fit me like this helps with my self-esteem, which is pretty wounded as I watch my tummy grow. They work great in my professional life. I only wish they came in other colors, like khaki, tan, brown and grey. Would definitely buy again."
Just what I needed to complete my halloween costume
Very nice blouse
"It is a nice slipper, but everyone needs to beware when ordering!  The sizing is way off.  My husband has worn this type of slipper [and size] for more than 30 years and absolutely loves it.  When I ordered the slipper from this manufacturer, it was way too small in both length and width and I had to return and reorder which added to my cost.  While Amazon was very easy to work with, it was frustrating and disappointing on Christmas Day."
"Actually really well made for a Halloween costume...pleasantly surprised. The medallions are a little difficult to get on, but still a very nice outfit!"
"I had to do a lot of alteration to the bodice to get it to fit my daughter properly - none of the pleats are tacked down, so the overlapping panels tend to expand when you don't want them to, and it's cut extremely low with no attachment between the panels. I shortened the straps, tacked all the pleats, and added a piece of fabric in the center of the bodice as a modesty panel because a camisole wouldn't be cut right with the lines of the dress. It's ok fabric and somewhat decently made, but you definitely get what you pay for!"
"I have these in black. Love. Cute w/ rolled jeans, leggings & casual dresses. Grey pair is a bit larger. Will need to insert insoles. So, sizing inconsistent."
"Great costume, my 5 year old grandson loves it."
The boots were great however they did run long. I ordered a size 9 as I usually wear a nine especially in a pointed shoe. Unfortunately I did return them as they were too big
i have been wanting a pair in my size forever and they are so hard to find!!!! it i wear bigger soxs they fit perfict!
"My favorite bra. Very comfortable, looks smooth under clothes.  This is my 2nd time buying them. Hunted them down because I loved the first one so much."
PERFECT FIT! THIS IS THE BEST FITTING SPORTS BRA I HAVE EVER HAD! WILL ORDER MORE IN OTHER COLORS
Cute outfit for causal wear
I gave this as a gift for my Mom's birthday and she loved this so much she is really happy with this item.
fit great washed them and thir still black no fading
"fits well, was for my 16 yr old granddaughter who is a dancer and she loves the yoga shorts."
"Nice looking shoe, very comfortable with a decent amount of support. The soles are nice and thick and offer a lot of bounce for your step."
Really Nice Sweats for the $$!
I love these shoes on my son. I have the perfect outfit for picture day.
Bought this for a baby shower and everyone loved it so much.
Levis are Levis. Husband loves them. And they came really fast. Color was a tad darker than expected. But that's fine.
"Smaller than what it appeared to be on the picture, but beautiful indeed."
"My daughter who is 5'6"" and weighs 120 pounds runs cross country so she is at 1-2 hours a day.  She is in a women's 6/8 so we got this for her.

Our tank ran big and when I mean big, I mean it's too big for her to run with just a running bra and this.  She has to wear a tee under it which defeats the purpose of wearing a tank.  The first time she wear it (yes she's a teenager so her judgment is, well, poor), she was training at the local high school.  The coach immediately corrected her and told her to wear her tee over it.

She did say she liked it though.  It was cool and kept her from overheating in the mile she ran before the coach caught her.  The saying is cute."
"nice laces, replaced the ones in my 20 year old boots that were cloth.
45 inch fits 8 eyelet perfectly.  Ties easily and stays tied."
"Purchased for my husband, the fit is great and a great quality for the price. I do wish that there were additional options to choose from."
"I recommend it. I wear number 8-10 (clothes), but I bought the number 12, because it is supposed to be a little bigger in order to be comfortable. And it wears perfectly."
My wife loves these earings and wears them often. They reflect the light and brighten up whatever she is wearing. They are a good gift for the woman in your life or a great gift for you if you are the woman. Classy look at a reasonable price.
"I live in a very humid city and don't wear skirts because I can't handle the chafe. My friend recommended these to me and, in as much as undergarments can be life-changing, these have been life-changing. I wore them while touring Paris and bought several more pair when I got home. They aren't shapewear, so they're not too tight, the fabric is smooth and stretchy. The waistband rolls a little bit, but it's not so bad to make me dislike them."
"I ordered 5 different Pea Coats for my son to try and see which he liked best and which fit better. He is 6'1"" 220lb size 45 chest.
We got the Large.
This coat the Tommy Hilfiger Pea Coat was the only one of the 5 that actually looks like a traditional Pea Coat, and was the only one with the Pea Coat buttons, and the underarms fit the way they are supposed to.
Looks great on, the thickness of the wool is really nice too, it is well made. His only wish was that it was about 2 to 3"" longer..
Keeping this one returning the others..
The other 4 were returned, they looked more like dress coats and my son wanted a more traditional Pea Coat. And this one was a perfect fit and style.
Also the other 4 were strangely sewn under the arms like 3 to 4 inches to long under the arm pits making the coat move strangely when reaching or lifting his arms."
"Beautiful dress, but very long and the boobs side are very loose. I bought the large...not sure if I needed the medium...i will have to take it alteration before I can wear it."
Great material and wonderful heavy duty leather handles. This purse futs everytbing and has great compartments to find things easily. Have recieved lots of compliments on the bag as well. Great every day casual carry bag.
"I like it, it is just to small. Oder at least two sizes up."
"Nice shorts, especially when you consider  the price. They look ""cool,"" not the ""old guy"" look. Workmanship is not amazing (some long threads hanging, etc.), but I would not hold it against them because of the price. Other than that rather small detail, stitching is clean and, importantly, they do not shrink in the wash."
"My medium sized glasses fit perfectly in the case, and protects my glasses.  I have used this type of case before, and the spring cover only seems to last a year.  If this one lasts as long or longer, I will update my review to 5 stars."
"Good stockings.  My first pair got a hole in the toe after the first time wearing them, but all the other pairs have been duarable.  They go up well past my ankle though.  I'd say just about where my calf starts.  I wear a size 6.5 -  7 US Woman's shoe and am average size (5'2"" ~130lbs).  They don't slide down really and the color is good fo rme - maybe just a little darker than my own skin (I'm a light/pasty/pink shaded white girl).  :-)"
"Based on experience with a previous boot order from this brand, I ordered a size larger than I usually wear and they fit ok. I wear an 8.5 or 9 and the 10 is ok. Not super roomy, but OK with socks. I think the fake wool will mash down pretty fast and provide more room. They are cute and I was looking for a non-leather, non-wool alternative to Uggs. Haven't worn them much or outdoors, so I can't comment on the durability."
These were beautiful but one of the stones was missing so I had to send back & I am waiting on the replacement pair
"Bought these for my boyfriend, he has worked doubles in these cooking on the line and loves these! Bought in December and they are still in great condition (now May) and comfortable."
BOOTS run large and wide.
I really like the colors of this socks set. good value!
"The color is beautiful and Top is very soft and pleasant to touch but it it a little larger then I would like , wish would have been xs option"
"very warm , fit, and very good, only the heel seems a little high for me, but it is ok, i like this shoes."
I really like these sandals--they're great for walking--but they are much tighter than all my other Keens. I had to cut the elastic binding on the strap and that helped. I keep hoping they'll stretch out!
"Super Warm. Must for any outdoorsy type of human. Also, long as heck so every part of my head and neck stays warm! Thanks carhartt!"
He loves them! :-)
Really comfy and a good deal for 3 pairs. Soft and thick
super cute...ordered 3 colors
Favorite of all of my cover ups!
Product as expected. A little thin.
13 year old son wears them all summer when he is just lounging around or going to the pool.
"These are really soft and comfy with pockets too. The color and fit is true to pictures. They are baggy and not form-fitting, but super comfy hang-out pants. I ordered LG, but could have gone with M, as they would have fit. I just washed mine in hot water and high heat dry & they shrunk down to fit."
"I was looking for some large hoops that were different than just silver and these are perfect! They are light weight, beautiful design, and feel very sturdy!"
Good looking pants but are actually kinda grey. Not to much on slim fit side either. Regardless I got mine tailored and they pretty good
Great looking rugged jeans.  These are the second pair I have bought only in a different wash.
"I bought these for my 4 year old niece, she has clearly inherited my shoe addiction and she loves them!!  My brother called to say he thought I had spent too much money on these as her feet are growing so much, he thought they were very expensive boots!!  Definitely a great value!!"
"perfect fit, great price"
I love these packing cubes!  Keeps my clothes and accessories tidy and makes it easier to move my luggage to hotel drawers and back.  Now I use these packing cubes every time I travel.
"Hubby did NOT like that he's getting older, Levis decided he could look better with another style of jeans, yes, yes he does.  (LOL)"
"This was a valentines gift to my future husband and I wanted it to be very special as I have never bought anything like this for a man. Needless to say he loved them, they are the perfect size for a man to wear. Great quality! Very pleased and pleased that I made him happy!"
to small for the main package but I do like the comfort and fit around the waist.
I am very please with my socks. They fit nicely and there appearance is perfect! I will order similar sock products in the future.
"American Apparel shirt with a silk screen flag on it. If you are fat and don't fit American Apparel sizing, size up.
Docking a star because the flag is printed backwards. One reviewer said this was fixed? The stars on mine were still on the wrong (right hand) side.
Good shirt, washed it 3 times already and there is no sign of wear."
"Good quality costume wig. I don't wear wigs except as costumes so I can't compare, but I'm happy with this one. The ear thing does NOT come with it."
"I read the reviews before purchasing these.  I would say these do run small.  My 10 year old daughter wears a size 3 in kids, sometimes 3 1/2.  The size 5 is perfect on her without socks.  I don't know that she'd wears socks with these anyway.  If so, they'd be thin.  The quality is fine and she likes them.  I usually buy a new pair of these for her every fall/winter season.  For $14 I don't expect these to last years."
"I am 73 and have arthritis in my feet, these shoes are so comfortable I can wear them all day."
"Very pleased, it's a nice jacket that fits well,l am a really petit girl (4.10) and also tiny (94) so l ordered and XS size and feels good, just a bit tight on my arms but l guess because of my job (l work out a lot) so have very muscular arms. The color is like in the picture an quality is good too....Hope this helps!"
"Really cute bathing suit!  The bottom fit as expected, the top was a little too tight.  Since it included removable pads in the top, once they were removed, it fit much better.  For people looking to figure out what size this really is, my daughter is a 34C bra and normally wears a M in underwear and small in Capezio dance shorts.  This is not a Large by any stretch of the imagination."
My toddler boy loved these. The first time they were a bit hard for him to put on but it looks like they've stretched a bit.
"My daughter loves Peppa.  In general terms, clothing has great quality and the art is really nice and well done.  The problem is with the sizes.  I bought everything when my dauther was 3 and a half; and, reading the comments and talking a look at the size table I order everything for 6Y, and I wasn't wrong.  T-shirts, jackets and dressess fits perfect and she will keep using them all this year."
I really enjoy this ring!  My daughter wanted one too so our second purchase!
"Super cute and great quality, but sizing is weird. My daughter is 10 months so I ordered the 12 month size so she could have a little room to grow. The shirt fit, but the pants were way to big. I got back on and ordered the 0-6 month set because reviews said it was really big. The pants fit perfectly but the shirt was too small. So I rated this set 4 stars because it is really cute, but had to order to sets in order to make an outfit that fit!"
"bought a Large, I wear a size 12 / 38B, I would have liked it to be a little larger. Don't think it would work for a larger bust.  The back does not have lace, which doesn't bother me. However, I wish the back was a little longer and not so sheer. Will have to wear a camisole under. The lace on the front is not laying flat on the bottom, hoping it will be better after I wash it. It has a good feel to it,arm holes are good."
"These are amazing! Super soft just like LLR bit half the cost! I have one other pair of leggings from these guys and I love them too! I bought the skull and roses leggings the print was right side up unlike how the picture shows, the only thing is is that there was a small hole in the chin buy I'll be sending back and getting a new pair asap!"
These fit as expected based on other reviewers. My daughter wears a size 10 women's shoe and we ordered the large. They are cute and seem to be better made than I had expected for the low price. Super glad I ordered them!
This is very flattering. I wore it with a maxi skirt. I was worried about a stain it had on the front when I received it but because I needed it for a trip the next day I washed it and it turned out fine.
I bought this coat for my mother and she absolutely adored it!  She kept talking about the  quality and how much of a perfect fit it is.  It's a really nice design.  I purchased it on 11/09 and was lucky enough to get it for $84!
"I'm usually a ""large"" medium to a large.  Due to the reviews, I ordered the large.  It's beautiful, good quality and I've washed it twice now and it hasn't shrunk.  I'm ordering this in 3 more colors!!"
"I especially love the colors and vibrant fabric.  I could do without the pleats in the front, but I wore it tucked into slacks and it was fine.  The Anne Klein tops made in Vietnam--as this one is--are so well made.

I don't know why this review is coming up as me having bought an x-small.  I bought a small."
"Nice casual dress for travel and warmer climates. This dress falls at tea length on my 5'10 frame. Comfy, cool, adjustable and packable. I would buy it again and I may in another color and style. I've bought several Sakkas items and love them all."
Very comfortable scrub top. Love the stretchiness. Only con is that I am heavy cheated and it fit pretty snug on my boobs and it was a little tight on the arm area when you raise them up. It is a kind of long top but not terrible. Got the pants as well the colors were a perfect match and the pants were just as comfortable
Great item.  sturdy and just the right length.  I always use a shoe horn to put on shoes.  This really saves on the back . . . . especially in the morning!
Sleek shoe. I like it
"Love them fits very good but, no arch support,"
Very comfortable with loads of support for the arch. Since I have very wide feet I purchased them one size up and got the fit just as expected.
very comfortable...will purchase the same in nude.
"This jumped up to one of my favorite tops rapidly. I wear it with a high belt and it makes me look nice. Comfortable fit, falls nicely.

One downside is that this thing shows sweat like a mother-loving beast. If you think you might exert yourself at all while wearing this, either plan ahead with something sweat stopping or just know that the whole world will be aware of your efforts. Maybe own up to it and help someone move in this thing? You'll look like the hardest working person there. That'll show your friends how great of a friend you are!"
"If it would have fit, this would have been a perfect dress to wear anywhere! It's a heavy weight material and looks very expensive...if you are a size 18W, don't bother ordering a 22, it still won't fit."
These are outstanding cargo pants. The quality is outstanding and fit is very comfortable. I like the convenient pockets. I highly recommend these pants.
GREAT PRODUCT  QUAILITY
these t-shirts keep me cool there very comfortable and I will be buying more!
"This is just perfect. I bought it as a gift for my wife and she is thrilled. There is a change pocket on one side, and the credit card holders on the other. Beautifully mad and very compact."
"Ordered two sizes since I wasn't sure how Goddess sizes ran, glad I did needed the larger size ...fits snigger than my Olga."
"I tried this bra an another Playtex. This one fits great, but after 10 hours of work my shoulders get a little sore with this bra. Im a 34 DDD"
"This is a really bright shirt and the quality is great!  I bought it for my 4 year old and he loves it.  The shirt did not shrink or fade with washing, and it is true to size.  It is a very cute shirt and well made. The shirt is a thicker material...not the cheap thin type."
"Very happy with this wallet! It is made of the same material as my purse. I've been looking for a grey color that matches my purse, all the other wallets I've found were either too dark or too light and surprisingly, this one is just the right color! The material is like a faux saffiano leather, feels nice. It is roomy, although it's a little hard to take my cards out, but I just got it yesterday maybe I have to break it in. You can easily hold money in there without having the fold the money up, if you have a small enough phone it can fit in there too. I have an iPhone 6s Plus, that unfortanely didn't fit but that's okay! I still am very satisfied with this purchase. Lovely!"
"very cute shoe to wear with jeans, and comfortable too."
Great fit and they are comfortable.
"There is no push up in the top and the cups are kind of weird. I would suggest not getting this if you want a push up or have smaller boobs like myself, it makes me look super flat chested. Other wise it's  really cute and sexy."
Well made and fits as it should. I will definitely buy more.
"It's a slim fit, without much extra room. 30"" waist fits exactly as expected. The material isn't stretch at all, which becomes a small problem when I need to move around more (the legs stick when wet), but for regular walking around beach use, it's not an issue. If you need something that gives you good flexibility/motion, I'd look elsewhere."
"I bought these for myself and I love them.  Just so light and gorgeous.  Beautiful to look at and there is nothing cheap about them!  If you're considering these earrings, please purchase, they are well worth it!"
"I love these socks! Having a business profession i needed some socks that attracted the eye and these were all i expected them to be! They are kinda losing ""smoothness"" now after washing and dryinf them frequently but, you won't be dissapointed"
Very good quality for the price!!!!!
Absolutely love this dress!!! I wanted to look sexy and it did the trick. I'm a BBW girl and it put all my bumps in all the right places. It reminds me of the MC Hammer song pumps and a bump
"pros: good sneakers fit well, durable, comfortable, look great

cons: memory foam pad shifts inside sneaker, lil bulky/big. thank you"
"The color shown is a little different, but it's very soft and nice."
Very cute.  Arrived super fast!!
"Too large for women, and somewhat stiff.......but still wear it to show my dedication"
"great look, very nice for resort wear! perfect color, just a bit off white."
"I used to be one of those jerks who judged Crocs owners, but goodness help me, I love these shoes. I saw a girl wearing them on the subway and asked where she got them, and I could hardly believe it when she said they were Crocs! I bought them in brown and black for summer (I usually wear a 9.5 or 10 wide and the 10 fit me perfectly), and they are hands-down the most comfortable flats I've ever owned. On top of being stylish (I've received many a compliment on them -- especially from girls like me who used to have jelly shoes when we were little!), they're very breathable, which makes them excellent for warmer weather. They also have pretty decent arch support, and the longer I've had them the better they've come to fit my feet -- they really do mold to the shape of your foot the more you wear them. Also, at about $40, they're a good deal; I've paid twice that amount for much less durable, much less comfortable shoes. A great buy!"
I anticipated buying them bigger considering I'll be putting them over jeans.
Dainty.  Hard to tell but the petals are white.  Nice though.
I love this!! The first day I wore it to work I received good compliments.
"Honestly I wasn't expecting much for twenty bucks I don't normally wear dresses but needed one in my wardrobe for special occasions this dress is amazing ..
comfortable and the quality is fantastic it's just a great dress I highly recommend this purchase I still have to pinch myself because I can't believe it was only 20 bucks I want to get a couple other colors now."
"I started running to lose weight. I took some workshops on correct form. I run with a midfoot strike and a slight forward lean, at least I try to. Despite being careful about form, runs longer than five miles tend to cause me plantar fasciitis. Which sucks, as you know. Until now, the best shoe I'd found was the Mizuno Wave Musha, though I also liked the Brooks Racer ST5 though it does have a more substantial heel. In a book about correct form and running shoes I saw a reference to Altra and tried the Instinct 1.5. No more pain. The shoe is very comfortable. It is not heavily padded at all, in fact, it feels kind of like running shoes feel when it's time for a new pair--very little cushioning. But it works, for me. It is not what most would call a ""minimal"" shoe, you don't get a great deal of ground feel, it's not a Vibram, its far more substantial. P.S. I tried the Torin, another model from Altra, and hated it, felt like I was about to teeter over. The Instinct 1.5 is my new fave."
"My second pair. In rehab walking after some kind of virus that left me paralyzed for little while.  Shoes do seem to help in my walking with walker. They feel sturdy and help with ""tone"" in leg.  Would buy again in future.  First pair a little tight for wide.  This pair seems okay."
nice and warm.great for sleeping in too
"These are my got to brand of flip flops, they're well built and last a long time. It takes about a week to get them broken in, after that they are awesome!"
"Great bag! Took this on my cruise, and used it at every port that we disembarked.  Great bag with enough storage to hold and organize many items, but small enough that you did not feel over weighed down.  Super durable travel bag with all the anti-thief security that makes you feel safe with it your important documents while in an unknown tourist locale."
Love this ring-very art deco and stylish
"VERY STYLISH, BUT ORDER A SIZE UP, OR MAYBE EVEN A SIZE AND A HALF!!"
"My daughter described this as ""Soft and comfy"".  She's particular about itchy material and her liking this speaks a lot if the quality.

Casual enough to wear to school but it's also perfect for Sunday church."
great set - very comfortable.
Love Love Love these sunglasses!!! They are super comfy and cute!! You can't beat the price for the quality!!! I'll be ordering more for sure!!!
wore to pro cosplay event didn't hurt till hour 6
"It's a stocking material, so it's very stretchy and fits just fine! A little confusing to put on, but it fits great, very sexy!"
Functional backpack. Very handy that it folds up into a pouch when not in use. Material is quite thin but perfect for packing extra sweaters and such.  Also comfortable to wear and can hold a lot of stuff. Lots of pockets!
"Perfect size, secure back, great shine and exactly as described."
Have to send back.  Need a half size bigger.
"After reading these reviews, I was hesitant to purchase 2 of these costumes. I was so worried the shirts would be way too small for my husband and I. I just received them today, and they fit perfectly! Granted, the sleeves are a bit big and long on me, as I am female, but other than that, there is extra room for both of us in our shirts. I am 5'6, wear a size L-XL in ladies' shirts and a large in men's shirts. I am very ""blessed"" in the bust to be honest, and I ordered the size large. There was still plenty of room for me in it. My husband is 6'1 and normally wears a men's size medium-large shirt. I also ordered the large for him. The sleeves fit him much better. The length was perfect on his long frame. I didn't find the material was super thin, like many said. If anything, I'd say it doesn't breathe enough. To be fair, I live in a hot climate. Some of our Halloweens are warm and some are cool. Hopefully it's a cool one this year, or we'll be burning up in these shirts! Quite a few people said to order a size above what you would normally wear. That was not the case for us. Maybe the shirts are inconsistent, or have been in the past. But I tried on both sets and they fit me exactly the same. The hats were perfectly sized, as well. The only complaint I have is with the glasses. They are super small. My husband's were too tight for comfort. Unfortunately, we're going to have to find him a different pair at goodwill or some other cheap store.

All-in-all, a decent buy for Halloween. It was worth the price!"
Love these pants.  Fits consistent with previous versions ordered over the past couple years.  I wear these at work and love the wash/warm iron/wear characteristics.  Color doesn't fade either.  Solid.
"This is a quality garment. I have a large six month old baby and the nine month size has just enough room that I know he'll be able to wear this for a few months.
I only wish the sleeves tucked over his fingers as an option."
I bought this for my wife and now she is hooked on Pandora.  The chain is quality and isn't going to fall off.  Really makes any wife's day.  I recommend for a gift.
"What can I say, its Levis."
Fit great. Used for my daughter's horse show last weekend. It really pulled her outfit together
Beautiful vibrant color....
"works great, very sturdy"
Great boot but they fit small and exchanging is difficult for correct size.
"I am surprised at how roomy this bag is because it doesn't look like one of those huge teacher bags. It's stylish and solid and fits my laptop, some books and all the other necessities a teacher needs. I love that it's pretty much waterproof and very well made."
They're smaller than I expected but I still wear them and like them a lot. They're good slippers and are worth the money.
in love with this cover up. I initially bought it to wear over a swimsuit. I have worn it out over a tank top and jeans. only problem i have is it slips off the shoulders readily so I have to keep pulling it up...great packaging I still have the zip lock back it came in.
LOVE THE SHOE!
"My hot hubby looks even hotter in these babies! We love Amazon - especially for shopping for men's Levi's jeans. We always know we can expect high quality, good fit each and every time. No brainer, guys."
Got this for my older niece and she loves it.  It seems to fit well but we will soon find out when she tries over the weekend a local anime convention.
Really cute shoes for the price.  Would recommend these.
Came as described and fitter perfect.
These are super-cute AND comfortable.  Glad I purchased them.
"This product gives me a nice color, and it smells better then most self tanners. I like the foam, which makes it easy to apply.  You can use the Xen-tan glove, or you can use disposable gloves. I just used it for my legs and arms. It is pretty expensive for what it is. I usually use Suave Professionals Visible Glow Self-Tanning Body Lotion, Fair to Medium 7.5 oz, and I love it! The price is great, and the color lasts several days, if not a week. It doesn't rub off on clothes, like the Xen-tan does. However, the Suave has that self-tanner stink.

Give this a try, if you are looking for a nice self-tanner, and you don't mind spending the money.  You can see that the reviews speak for themselves."
"These arrived quickly and I couldn't wait to wear them.  I ALWAYS order a half size up as I wear orthotics and also require a wide size.  However, they didn't have a wide size but I went ahead and ordered anyway.  My orthotics fit perfectly and I didn't have any toe box issues so the medium size width was no problem either.  I had a doctor's appointment yesterday and wore them to the hospital.  You cannot believe how many people told me how much they liked my sneakers.  I also wore a tie dye sweat shirt to match and they really enhanced my look.  Not only do they look fabulous they are comfortable as well.  I highly recommend these beauties."
"I wear 8.5W and I bought 8.5. These were a little snug at first across the width, but the leather is so soft that after walking around in them for a few hours, they stretched a bit and now fit perfect. I love the soft leather soles that are noiseless when I walk, and the minimal foam insole. It feels like walking barefoot. Since I got these I've been wearing them every day all day and my feet are so happy."
"Excellent option for the price. Cheaper versions tend to cut into my foot, but these give me no issues at all.  Highly recommend."
"Comfy and stylish and sassy
My hubby salutes you"
Love all Teva sandals
I am in LOVE with this onesie and am buying soooo many more. I'm thrilled they've gotten more colors/ patterns. true to size. If you're wide in your middle (Like me) it provides enough stretch and is super durable STILL VIBRANT AND COLORFULL AFTER TWO MONTHS OF NEARLY EVERY DAY USE AND WASH
"Perfect for wearing with Keds or Vans! Very comfortable, doesn't slip off the heel at all."
Perfect for small gifts
Wife likes this shoe.
"These are the best underwear I have ever worn. I went and ordered 6 more, they don't ride up they stay cool. I do lawn maintenance in FL and it's HOT! These stay cool almost like your not wearing anything."
Great travel bag.  I have a larger one as well.
"Excellent quality and beautiful chain. You can't tell that it is not entirely gold. I've been wearing it every day without taking it off for about 2 months. No tarnishing at all. It looks like it did the day I bought it. In fact, I'll be purchasing more from this company as I now know how great the quality is."
"The bag is nicely made, seems to be genuine leather. However, the fabric liner inside is already fraying and pilling after only barely 2 weeks of use. I have nothing sharp or heavy in the bag but the lining already has pills and when you take something out of it, the lining produces fluff/white dust.
So weird. But it is a beautiful bag. Maybe they should have used a better quality lining because the bag is not cheap for what it is."
"These shoes can't be beat. I've searched for a perfect pair of black ""flats"" for a good 5 years now. Skip the flats! These wedges look classy and feel like slippers. I wear them most a) at the office and b) when I travel. I can walk for miles in these without pain. They work with black corduroy pants just as easily as a little black dress, which reduces the amount I need to pack. These are basically the perfect shoes for work & play. I want them in a ton more colors. FYI on sizing, I usually wear a 7.5 and I bought a 7, which fits perfectly"
NICE SKIRT!
"Per other reviews, I ordered this in an XL size, instead of large.  That made it fit just right.  The neckline comes down to just above the bra strap in the middle.  Perfect cleavage.  Ordered 3 more."
The tie is super easy to tie and looks great. My only complaint is that after three wearings it started getting some frayed threads. They're easy to cut off but I would've hoped that wouldn't happen so soon.
Great belt and great for the price
"I am a native Vermonter, now living in Wisconsin, and I love Darn Tough products. There are two things that you should never settle for, one is corn syrup with maple flavoring, the other is a sock that wasn't made by Darn Tough. Do yourself a favor and never buy another brand."
My dad loves these shoes.  Comfort all day long
"The Fruit of the Looms are larger with less elastic and will fit great for shoe size 11 and above. The Hanes Ultimate Ankle socks are smaller with more elastic for a snugger fit. Great for shoe size 10 and below. Super tight socks can hurt feet by squeezing them, and super loose socks can hurt the bottoms of feet by moving around too much.

Also, the Fruit of the Looms go up lower on the ankle. Hope this review helps."
"This is a truly outstanding coat. I got it just before the winter kicked in, and so had the chance to really check it out while I was in Chicago for a while during sub-zero wind chill. With a flannel shirt under the coat, I was toasty warm. The coat really did a nice job of keeping my torso and arms quite comfortably warm and the length is great. The hood was also surprising. It feels comfortably loose and doesn't seem like it would keep your head and ears warm, but it really did (it must take advantage of keeping in body heat) - I had a fleece cap that I was able to conveniently keep in an inside pocket on the coat in case I needed it, but most of the time I didn't, even in the 1/2 mile walk to the train and time spent on the platform outside.  I used one of the two top front snap pockets for my Ventra (train fare card) which was handy to keep it safe and not have to get to my wallet.  The main front vertical pockets are fine for my bulky heavy-duty gloves, leaving the side pockets for my hands when I want to.  The zipper is large-tooth, which I like - it means it's not as smooth in operation, but it's a heavier-duty zipper that's less likely to separate, etc. - a problem I've had with most lower-quality winter coats.

I've also used the coat on a few milder days and it did fine, without being oppressively hot.  Overall, a nice-looking, quality coat that makes me feel comfortable in facing the severest upper-midwest winters."
"I wear this shaper under a gauze floor length dress and it is as described. I had been looking for many months and finally came across this . It's cool and moves with you, doesn't bunch or creep like other shapers do...I love it!!!"
"l really thought this was going to be one of those deodorants that you have to apply with your hands. I've used deodorants like that before, but find them entirely too messy and hard to wash off. This deodorant comes with a slightly domed area inside the cap that helps you to spread the deodorant on without using your hands at all. The only tricky part is figuring out just how much to use, but I figured that out pretty quickly. I still wipe the little applicator area off periodically with a damp washcloth periodically, but it's not really necessary. I have to say I love this stuff, it works great, and I really like this delivery system. I'll be buying this again when this tube runs out."
"When I give a special gift to someone, like a best friend turning 30, I create a Tinkled Pink gift. I make a fun tag that says I'm tickled pink you're turning 30! Etc..
I love that this bag is pink but also shows the contents so that I can fill it with a bunch of pink items visibly!"
"Item was as described.  Comfortable to wear. Not too big, they look like a diamond."
Really great fit and smooth material will buy again.
"I usually wear a size 6.5, however I have a pair of shoes by Chinese Laundry so I know they fit just a little bit on the small side, so I ordered a 7 and they were perfect.  I love these boots, there are super comfortable and I have yet to have any issues wearing them all day.  Granted, I also sit at a desk so I can't say how they would hold up during a day shopping.  I only have a few minor complaints; 1) the toe is very pointy which I knew when I bought them, but they tend to make my feet look really big.  Being that I am only 5' I think it looks a little weird when my feet look to be at least a size 9; 2) The boots come fairly high up the leg and since I am so short I find them to be a little too high which leads to my final comment, 3) Since they come right up to my knee, where the calves get thinner, the top of the boot gapes a bit.  Overall, my complaints are really only a result of my height, or lack thereof, but none of them would prevent me from wearing them or to even consider returning them."
Wonderful. Fit perfect. Super soft on the inside.
I really like this graphic. It has received comments and is fun. The shirt is soft and comfortable.
"Not quite as soft as the terrycloth robe it replaced, but fit well and is comfortable."
I have the odor of peppermint with me.  Love this
I really like this sandal.  Good buy.
"I bought this for a costume.  I didn't expect to want to wear it other times.  However, I really like it and have worn it several times."
Very nice and comfortable shirt! I wear it at the office. Its got a casual feel but a professional appearance.  Just what I look for.
"I LOVE THESE SHOES!!!! They fit perfect and no ""breaking-in"" needed!! My feet feel good after wearing these shoes for hours and hours! My new favorite style!
I'm so happy with my Saucony Lancers!"
"Very tight! I have to go through all sorts of contortions to get this bra on and off over my head. I checked the size chart before purchasing it, but it runs a bit small and tight. I have kept it and will continue to use it, since I am engaged in a serious workout program and I expect to be losing inches in the near future, so perhaps it will fit better at that point. My advice to others is to buy a larger size if you are on the borderline in the size chart."
"But fit, and my boy likes it"
These are very comfortable and can withstand the beating from my steel toe work boots. They fit very snug at the calf so consider that when purchasing. I like that though because then they don't slip down easily.
"I love you see it on my son, amazing shoes! He also love to use it and told me that its very comfortable on him"
Fits my son well and he finds them very comfortable.  They are light and easy to pack also.
These are so great.
"I wanted this to work out, because it is darling.  I typically wear a medium; based on other views, I sized up to a large.  Although the top was flattering, the bottom was so tight on my hips and thighs that it looked like a floral printed sausage casing.  Not my best look, for sure.  I don't think even an XL would've worked.  Such a shame I had to return, because the suit itself is really well-made, especially considering the price point.  Probably a perfect fit for ladies with smaller frames!"
"Really nice and good quality,I wear size s-m and  I ordered xl and it's fitting like a glove! not big at all!"
It was cute but I bought it too big.
"Very comfortable. I purchased the black Fimley and the  sizing  on the Fimley style s  inconsistent as it has a tighter fit around bunion area and in-step when compared to this style- Fayda. This Fayda sandal is roomy and comfortable. I purchased my regular size.
I thought sandals were leather especially for the pricing. I should have read description thoroughly. The material is synthetic."
A bit tighter than I excepted. OK
"This is a great work out shirt.  It is very light weight and dries quickly.  Not real roomy in the shoulders or sleeves.  I usually wear a medium (5'7"" 140 lbs) in shirts, but needed a large in the powertrain."
"It fits, but as shown in the picture it is a bit less ""fluffy"" or ruched in person...but, it is still a nice hat for the price."
I love anything in plaid.  My sister even bought me a plaid rubber scraper.  When I saw this purse I had to have it.  It's a great size.  Not too small and not too bug.  It holds my large wallet plus other essential purse items.  This brand lasts forever.  I bought a large satchel 10 years ago and still use it every day for my gym stuff.  The Amazon price is less than retail.
Purchased for my youngest son and he appreciates the fit and quality.
Very good. Nice color.
Bought for my daughter as gift. I just visited her and when we were shopping she pulled it out. It is soooo cute and she loves it.
I really like them they are very comfortable and looks good when I wear them. I wear 32A so i ordered size 32. They are perfect for small bust.
as my son said - the best he had ever
"I bought this shirt  because I recently bought two others like it (different colors) all the same size.  After one washing and drying this one seems just a bit larger than the other two but maybe it will shrink a little more after more washings and dryings.  The size will be ok even if it doesn't shrink more. I like the length, the material and the sleeve length.  Good shirt - I would buy again."
"I like a bit 'fatter' top on the FitFlop but for the price, I'll be wearing these for sure!  The studs are cute and the base feels like all my other FitFlops -- a little slice of supportive, spongy heaven."
"I am very happy with this purchase. The size of this bag (fits a petite person) and the handle drop  are what sold me. The six slip pockets on the inside are perfection. It is light, weight not as light as my LeSport bag, but it stands up on its own which is pretty important for me. I think the vinyl straps would have been better if they were fabric, because they do slip a bit."
I've had it for a few months and it still works perfectly after using it in a pool for the entire summer.  I wish it was a little thinner with a smaller face but it serves its purpose.
"Good seller, I recommend it"
My boyfriend loved it. As per other reviews I purchased one size down and it fits perfect
Great shoes and they have held up very well (I was skeptical because of the all the netting)!
"So beautiful! I wish I could have my little one wear it all the time. Even though the fabric feels rough when I hold her, the satin inside makes it comfortable for her."
"I have not worn them extensively, but they seem to have a more cushiony feel to them. It could be that the sole is slightly thicker. They were a bit smaller in size but they were still comfortable. A half size larger than normal might be a good choice for most people."
Little tight but still worked for my husband to dress as a disney tour guild for our party...he was sooo cute!
Love the black and the larger stone.
"I went ahead and gave this a fairly good review only because it felt comfortable when I tried it on.  I wear 9 1/2 but these only came in whole sizes.  I got size 10.  Since there is no adjustment on the back, it was too big to fix me.  I am returning this and just ordered a size 9.  I believe this will be a perfect fit.

I changed this to 5 stars because I returned the size 10 back to the company and ordered the size 9.  The fit is great and the sandal is very comfortable.  I have never had a sandal this comfortable. If you want a comfortable sandal, this is a must buy."
Price was perfect for these.  The fit was great.  They are comfortable.
"If you are looking to buy this, you won't be disappointed at all. It closes tight and opens easily. It holds multiple cards/credit cards/insurance card/drivers license.  It's perfect for this purpose only which is why I purchased it.  If you are looking for something to hold more like money and other items then this won't work.  The case is hard and great quality. It does not feel or look cheap. Great product and I would purchase another one!"
My husband had to have these altered in the waist because they fit a little looser than he likes. But they were still a great value even with the cost of the alteration. And he wears them continually during the winter -- I have to plan when to wash them so they are always available. I'm buying another pair for him in the fall so he has an alternate!
"These converse are great! This is my first pair, and I've wanted them for a long time. I normally wear about a size 9 in women's, but I ordered a size 6.5 (8.5 in women's). They fit perfectly, and they look awesome. The picture shows the tag without the new converse all star sign on it, but it does. I would recommend these to anyone who wants good converse!"
She is very excited to have it. It will go with her new boots. Was a very good buy .  Would recomend .
"Bought these for Father's Day this year and my dad is in love with them!  I wanted to get him a little ""luxury"" feeling undershirts since he complained that his never last very long.  I saw these had decent reviews and I know how soft this fabric can be, so with the price, they were perfect!  Another brand sells these for $35 EACH and they feel darn near the same.  Two months later and they still look nice and new, so far so good!"
"Product as good as expected, Can't go wrong.  Great Buy, price is right."
"I have pretty thick legs and I wasn't sure these would fit well. I wear a size 7 or 9 in jeans. They go up fine, and aren't too tight on my thighs. They don't seem like they will last long, but most stockings don't. That's what I'm looking for though, some that will last a little longer. I don't wear them very often even, and I try to be very careful. Overall decent for the price though. They do require a garter to hold them up, just so you know."
my son is now ready for this season
"This is so beautiful in person and better than I thought it would be! The material is a ""scuba"" type material, which I wasn't expecting. This is substantial and therefore very good at hiding my lumps and imperfections! What a pretty print, looking forward to wearing it."
"My toddler is now obsessed with Paw Patrol.  He only wants to wear Paw Patrol clothes.  This fit him perfectly, and he looks adorable in it.  Shirt held up to wear and multiple washings."
"Barely needed broken in, needed shined less than my old shoes, and lasted longer too. Looked good right up until the treads wore out years later."
"Comfortable and stylish. I've owned these for a while now and they are practically every-day shoes for me. They've held up really well. Some less quality black flats I've owned have worn badly at the heel (on my gas pedal foot), but not these. LOVE them! Great shoes. Fit as expected and are extremely comfortable."
"For the price, I can't complain. Don't know about the long-term durability at this point, but it's definitely a leather watchband at a low cost. Admittedly it looks a bit cheap, but I got exactly what I paid for."
I have several pairs of Yellow Box shoes love them all!
THEY LOOK LIKE SUEDE.VERY HIP BOOT.I BOUGHT SKETCHERS LAST YR IN BLK AND LIGHT BIEGE AND IM STILL WEAING THEM FROM AMAZON.THEY LOOK LIKE THESE RBLS..SO JUST BUY THEM.IM REALLY PICKY.I KNOW WHEN A ITEM IS GREAT.AMAZON DOES A WONDERFUL JOB IN KEEPING FOLKS CURRENT..CHEERS
I really love this jewelry stand. Well made and gorgeous! Arrived on time.
"Love these shoes-so fun and funky! Normally a size 7 fits me like a glove but these are a bit loose. I've worn them but felt like my foot was slipping out a bit.  I think if I put a little pad in the toe area, they'll be fine. SO CUTE!!!"
"Not the real deal corset, but it looks just the same.  Fits very well to my body shape and is easy to snap on.  Great sexy look."
"They are pricey, but I know they will do the job! Best pink boot I could find and she loves them, wore them around the house they were so comfortable! They do seem to run just a tad small. I bought a bigger size and I hope we can get 2 years out of them."
Very cute! But a little on the short side and I'm only 5 ft 3 and in just a few inches past my bottom but if I put it together with navy tights ans a red sweater and it looked cute. Taller girls might want to be careful buying this
This is a nice watch. Especially for casual wear. It is so comfortable and easy to put on and take off! No help or apparatus is needed. Also at the price it's a steal!!!!
"Item was of the most fantastic quality. Perfect fit in my ass pocket. Delivery was high-standard. Would buy from again. A very, very excellent product."
Perfect for the themed bday party I am attending
I ordered this to use for jogging and listening to my music and holding my keys etc. It is very nice. It holds a ton of stuff. I usually put my cell phone and keys in there and don't even notice it while I'm jogging. Also it stays in place and doesn't bunch up while running.
"Ive worn mine a few times, lightly (meaning not a lot of walking about in them) and they hold nicely. The material isn't scratchy and the lace is soft as well. However, the seams are off on the lace. The seam ends up on the front and slightly askew, when the fishnet seam is aligned up the back of the leg (in vintage fashion). This bothered me because they're quite noticeable seams, but they're still cute and if you're crafty, they're not beyond hope, especially for the price."
Very nice finish and material.  Have not worn it yet so cannot speak to comfort or durability but appears very well made.
"I change purses often so this makes it super convenient to do so. The RFID blocker is why I bought this, but its practicality makes it an even better buy."
My fiance loved it! She wears it on a regular basis! It doesn't sit too low or too high on chest and shines like crazy!  One downfall is the chain it comes with is not a very good one. Had to replace it with a box chain which is great quality!
"I got this one because my first Baggallini is too small for my cell phone and all the medical things I need to pack with me every day.  This bag is fantastic, the interior of ALL the pockets is a dark pink, which allows you to find things inside easily!  There was a weird zipper on the bottom of the exterior pocket on the backside, well, turns out, you unzip it and can slip it over your luggage on wheel's handle!  This is lightweight, but strong!  I got the gray because it was lesser in price, and it is a very nice color, almost looks black.  Bravo for another great product!"
very nice hoodie i ordered  it a little larger thats how my Grandson likes it and its perfect. We'll see how it holds up after washing but for now the fabric is soft and looks well made.
Exact size and quality is great.... Used them on Ecco boots
"Have owned for 5 years with fairly frequent hill walking use.  Altimeter appears as accurate as Garmin GPS.  Compass is adequate for any non precision use.  Generally have found the watch easy to use.

Battery seems to last 8 to 14 months with using altimeter for about 8 hours 2 - 3 times a month.

Watch strap loop broke after 3 years, purchased new generic loop for $3 via Amazon, good as new.

Did not give 5 stars due to display brightness in low light can be difficult to read,  Okay at night with the watches own light."
"Shipping came in two weeks. I have quite a small frame, so 32A was a perfect fit. Since I have a small frame, the wiring thing in the middle looked sort of awkward. Other than that, it's a beautiful bra."
This is still a bit too large for our twin girls - but they are preemies and know it will fit soo enough!! Really soft and a pretty shade of pink.
"We love these, but the leather doesn't smell like you'd expect. Its not pungent, but not a nice leather smell. Its soft though, but they also seem to run pretty big. I had my daughter fitted for a 3 in the fall so I figured I'd want a 4 the following summer (now). We kept them because she could walk okay, but shes been wearing them daily for about 6-7 weeks and the strap is so long that the Velcro doesn't make good contact. She can get them off really easily.  These would probably be ideal for chubbier feet, but she's a little thing."
Very pretty ring.  Love it!
These leather EASY SPIRIT shoes are just beautiful. So comfortable to wear all day and they are not heavy. Light on the feet and breathes.
"These are comfortable, well-made, stylish, well-fitting undershirts.  And the best thing: they are very reasonably priced.  Mens' underwear and undershirts can be quite expensive.  I've found these to be amazing quality and feel and a good value.  Size runs true and they are quite durable.  They last for over a year without looking yellowed or frayed.  And when you wear them, they feel good.

Great quality- good value."
"Soft jeans. Fit well , although they were a little big in the waist. Nice value for the price. Thumbs up."
"The dress fits well, it's a td long for me but with the addition of a belt, it works well. Fabric lightweight which adds to the movement of the dress.  It's a keeper was works well with the cascading coverup"
"I now have 4 pair of these!! I LOVE them! I ended up putting a tape measure under my shoe by 1"" and to my actual waist, which equals a total length of 43"". They come to within about 1/4"" of the floor or less with very short sandals. Just watch out for rolling wheels of desk chairs!! I run over my pants and get stuck occasionally!! They are thin enough for coolness, but thick enough to not see through!! If I wore control underwear or had no body rolls, or confident enough, I'd have gone to a MED and not large!!"
Didn't want anything over bearing and these are just big enough to make a statement but not be offensive
Bought as a B-Day gift for a friend.  She loved it and it is so bright and shiny.  Very happy about the purchase and will buy more from this Artist.
"Really a five star product. Four star review because description was not accurate in regard to the color of the Storm Gray gloves. They are a dark charcoal gray and the picture looks like an iridescent purple-gray color. The gloves are beautiful nonetheless. I purchased the Storm Gray Smart Tips. My knuckles measure 7 1/4 and while reviews said to order a size up I ordered the size 7 (small) and they fit perfectly. They will probably stretch so I could have even gone down to a 6.5 but I won't know until that happens. For now I am more than happy with the size I purchased. They have enough stretch to ball my hand into a fist. It's not stiff but very soft smooth leather. Doubt it's real leather but it looks and feel like 100% leather gloves I have owned before. Mine are lined with a knit material that is surely not cashmere but it's of a medium soft tight knit yarn that is better than bare leather alone. Great for commuting. Not great for doing work outside or being outside for extended periods. Bulkier insulated gloves would be better for that. The best thing is they ARE NOT BULKY like they look in the picture. I have small hands and fingers and they fit slim to my hands. At the same time the material is stretchy so I think they would fit larger hands/fingers just fine too! I also like that they are long and go about 3 inches past my wrist which is about a third of my forearm. No windy draft up my sleeve! The tags were on a little piece of material sewn on the inside with a hole. It's perfect if you want to attach glove clips without ruining your gloves. It's not thick and wouldn't stand much wear but it's a nice little detail. I highly recommend this product and would (and probably will) purchase again. I bought this with my own money out of desire/necessity, this is NOT a sponsored review in any way. Pics show the gray color against my light gray scarf, next to a navy leather glove and a black knit glove for comparison."
love theses shoes nice with jeans
"I love them and I'm female! I leave them in the car just got driving. No glare, doesn't steam up. Good price. I'm getting another pair for the hubby and giving my fancy expensive sunglasses away."
looks great pants are a little long but love the outfit will definately buy another one in a different color.
Fits well and looks awesome! Love this beanie!
"really like how unique this necklace is. I think I would have gone with a coral color, cause the black looks a little more gothic. but still fun to wear and get comments on!"
This is a quality product but a little too heavy for my 80 yr old mom who has shoulder pain. Need something a little lighter.
"Here's the thing. I didn't purchase these shoes expecting great arch support. I've got plantar fasciitis so unless the shoes are orthotic it's an unreasonable expectation that any tennis shoe will have the support I need. I just use inserts. The inserts that come with the shoe... I wish I could wear...they are so spongy and feel great on my feet! Too bad I need something stiff. The inserts it comes with remove easily and there is plenty of room in the foot bed to put my own inserts. The base of the shoe itself feels very supportive unlike a lot of others. Very comfortable. And I wondered how I might like it w/ no real tongue, but this is great too. The only thing I wonder is if eventually my toe will wear a hole through the top material like sometimes happens with the ""mesh"" type tops of training shoes. Time will tell. Bottom line - I LOVE THESE SHOES. And I rarely am able to say that."
kind of cheep quality
"Very comfortable and a great fit. I wear this bra during my kickboxing workouts and it really keeps ""the girls"" in place. No uncomfortable bouncing. I love them so much  that I bought more in each color available."
"Love the fabric, very light weight"
"Love this ring looks like the picture, but I haven't worn it yet."
"Love the dress, soft material great for hot weather, the color is a little lighter but  very pretty bay blue. I got Large, I am 36B, 5'6'', around 175 pounds."
"Love these shoes. I have been looking for this classic shoe for two years. The fit is great,
the quality is better than expected. Size is perfect. Fits like a glove and very comfortable. All
at a good price. Awesome."
Material is a little flimsey for an oxford but still works for me
"Fit great and comfy, but makes my feet sweat"
This is my all time favorite ring. It looks and feels great. It was delivered on the promised date. Can't beat the price. I would buy again!
"Love them, very comfortable.  Nice seller."
Amazing dress! Lovely color and material is very high quality. The lace details in the back and the embroidery throughout the dress makes the dress more special! I would definitely buy more from this company
"Very, very comfortable. Had never used the extended leg model before."
"This was the only product that I purchased for this type of brief that fit as advertised and holds up, thank you will buy again"
This works for me.
The only reason i give 4 starts is that the heel strap rubbed a blister on the back of my heel... but that is typical.  I have bony heels and any heel strap seems to do that!
Was looking for these glove for a while Isotoner keep your hands warm it looks nice with my leather coat !
"My kids love these footie pjs. They are soft & comfortable. My son is 4'11"" & the XL has some growing room, which we wanted."
"This is a great rain jacket in a wonderful color.  I'm 5,4 and 120lbs. I usually buy a small, but I needed a medium in this jacket, particularly because i want to be able to wear a fleece or sweater underneath.  my only complaint is that the zipper is a little bit temperamental. Other then that, great product!"
"Not sure what they mean by ""fit"" but its the perfect size wallet and suits my nerdy lifestyle perfectly"
"Very cute characters, fits great. My 7 year old was wearing 8 but noticed they started getting snug. So she wanted the next size up so they are a little roomy. My daughter is a tall and skinny side of a 7 year old for anyone looking for sizing info."
Fits perfectly...love them
"Talk about soft!  This scarf is one of the softest scarves I have ever had.  I love it because the manufacturer decided to make the scarf from all natural materials.  That alone makes the texture of the scarf appealing.  Also, not only does it feel great, but it looks great.  The unraveled ends give a style to the scarf that cannot be ignored; a detail that takes the scarf to the next level of being fashionable.  And, the scarf can be cleaned by dryel at home, but the maker recommends dry cleaning; the only pitfall of purchasing this scarf.  Otherwise, I recommend it.

Please note that this product was sold to me at a discount in return for an honest review. This honest, unbiased review is my own opinion after trying the product for myself."
Really nice coat
"Perfect maternity (and post delivery) dress. It highlights the belly when you want it to and hides the belly when don't. It's also incredibly easy to nurse while wearing.
I see myself wearing this for years to come."
"Great under tight clothing w/o creating a underwear lines. Washes nicely making it soft. Super breathable without being drafty. Good price for this brand and very well made.

BTW - I'm 5'5, 116lbs, 30E chest, broad shoulders, small waist/hips, butt. I got a small which has more a relaxed fit for me."
Great fit for my son. Price is great compared to in-store prices.
"I found this a great shoe for walking.  It is light, very comfortable and the rubble ""spikes"" give me plenty of traction.  The only major con for this product is that it is NOT waterproof.  I still find I wear this shoe 90% of the time the course is dry."
"I really like these shoes since I wanted a pair of booties I could walk on extensively. They are comfortable to wear and look really nice. However the fit is rather strange, it fits somewhat narrow on the toed area but wide on the heel."
"If you think of this as an upgraded paper bag you will be happy, if you think of it as tough or a mini cooler you will not.
This is a solid lunch bag but not really fantastic. It keeps stuff cool-ish and is good quality. Its light and the insulation is thin but not too thin, and it has a neat little pocket for a smaller water bottle. I was close to giving this particular bag 3 stars because it was just so close to being amazing... and yet they dropped the ball. I suppose since it is much cheaper than one of these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maxpedition-FillUp-Personal-Cooler-Bag-OD-Green-Small/dp/B00HVJILEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maxpedition FillUp Personal Cooler Bag, OD Green, Small</a>&nbsp;you can't expect it to come anywhere as close. Still the big areas of complaint are that the print is rather cheap/dull/subdued so it doesnt look nearly as good as real brushstroke camo can and that the top doesnt seal. The lid velcro's over but leaves a 1 inch by half an inch gap all along the top of the bag. You can synch it down a bit more by only using half the velcro strip, but it doesnt work so well when it actually loaded. The other two minor issues are that the bottle pocket isn't situated better--its made into the fold of the bag rather than being an add on, so if you have a big load you can't fit much in there, and that the stitching is already coming off in a few places. Lastly (so three minor issues) the carabiner is put in a weird place--off to the side instead of centered so it it won't toss as much. I lost a poor banana somehow because of the combination of it being lopsided, a drink pulling it funny, and the top not sealing. RIP banana you wouldnt have had to go if Burton had just done a little more..."
"Very nice layered vest and the fit was spot-on.  The color was as descripted.  Bought for my husband to wear to a concert and he looked really handsome in his vest.  The vest has such a rich look.  He wore it with jeans, but it would also look nice dressed up.  Will purchase again in a different color."
"My wife loves these shoes. Right off the bat, they were comfortable. Couldn't ask for anything better."
excellant
"Delivery time was good, almost as estimated . Ring is cute for elephant fanaics, like my grand-daughter, but very small and not as detailed as appears or as thick ."
Comfortable and flattering as expected.
"I liked the fabric and style of this dress but it was too tight in the bodice so I had to send it back.  I had ordered an XL, and my bust is a 42D so for someone with a small or average bust size it should be fine."
"I'm a 36D and I got a this bra new with tags in size 40DD from Goodwill. So sizing is off. It is comfortable and looks nice under shirts. It is, however a NOISY bra. I don't know how else to explain, but when I move around I can hear this bra squeaking. If you work in a quiet setting, people will definitely be able to hear your bra when you move. It literally squeaks in the area around the front claps. Lol. My boyfriend even commented on it and now I squeak near him just to be funny."
"Good quality material, fit perfectly for my daughter who is 25 lbs."
Great product thanks!
I love this watch. I had to buy a second after my one year old flushed the first one.
"is adorable, met my expectations"
Find the same type for the last 10 I like them on they fit good and You can for work they seem to last a while never had a problem with them except for the waistband started coming unraveled but that was easily fixed other than that they been pretty good for long as I've been using
I love this bra!  No more under wires.  Ever!!
Purchased these for my girlfriend. She wears a 7 1/2 thats what I purchased. She says they fit true to size.
"i love it, i am so happy now...thank you  so much for the beautiful ring"
"I always try to have at least one pair of clogs for my kids for the summer because it is convenient : easy to put on, they can go in the water with then and they are easy to wash! Those are as great as the Crocs but cheaper  I keep buying this brand summer after summer and I am never disappointed!"
"Like this sports bra, though it seems to run small.  Not sure if it's the band, or whether it's the length of the crisscross straps in back, but whatever it is, I ended up having to go a size larger.  Good support, and no ""headlights"" with this one.  Too bad it's not available anymore....I would've bought more."
Love them. Cant wait to wear them.
"This is the cutest dress and worth the splurge!! My little one looks adaorable in it.the shirt is a tad,small compared to the dress but you can get a bigger shirt one she grows out of it"
"I like the shoes really well. They are a little large. With socks they fit better, but still roomy. I think they were called relaxed fit. The memory foam is very nice. I use these as house shoes. So for standing very long doing chores, cooking, etc., the memory foam offers great support. This is the second pair of,  relaxed fit sketchers Ive tried. The others were way too big. To get a smaller size the price was almost doubled. To me that didn't  make sense so I just didn't order a smaller size on that style. My usual size is 6. On the other style I was going to try a 5, but not at double the price. I know Im talking about two different styles of sketchers, but only to say the relaxed fit is very relaxed."
I had the same Dickies belt that I bought during the first year of college and it just died out. I bought a new one and it worked perfectly just like my old belt! Love it.
"I absolutely love this!! It fits perfect, and is flattering. The only thing that could be improved on is the bead work. It is put on pretty poorly, and I had to super glue a few that fell off already, but I liked it enough to keep it."
These are what I'd call stylishly simple and quite elegant.  I'm very pleased!
Great fit for my newly potty trained boy.
"I love them!!! I was reading reviews that said they run a little bigger, so I ordered 1/2 size down and they're perfect. I can't wait to wear them more often and will definitely order another style in the future!!"
"Spot on in color and fit! Couldn't ask for a more tailored to my body type style. My only issue for the return was it was a little too ""wedding bridesmaid"" and not enough formal wear feeling to it.

5'4"" 130lbs and a size c."
Love the material just a lil long wish they had shorter styles of these overall 5 stars though
Will buy more of these. Comfortable.
"2XL fit my 2XL hubby just right and he liked the print. This was for our Halloween costume as skeletons, but he actually liked the shirt enough to wear it on the regular."
Fit was perfect!!! Best jeans I have gotten.
"Love this night dress. It is silky & long, good for days when you want to wear a dress but to lazy to shave.
I love the feel of it as it touches my skin"
It lasts over a year
"Great boots, excellent construction and insulation. Im confident my son will be warm enough and dry. We haven't been in the snow with these yet but he says they're comfortable and he really likes them."
"I love this.  It is the same brand as the one from my surgeon, but so much more comfortable around the armpits.  The bra part fits, even though I am a G cup- hooray!  My only problem was I followed the reviews and ordered larger rather than the size chart, so now I am going to have to alter this XL when I should have gotten a Medium."
Seem to be good quality and they look great but are  far too big.  They are marked as large which I ordered but are more like extra large.  Returning.
This is a very cute dress. The fit is perfect and the quality is really good too.
"I got these for my wife and had to end up returning them for being too tight over the top of her feet.  She's a 6, but the 7's fit much better.  FYI these seem to run a little small!  The exchange process was very easy and the seller was very accomodating.  Overall, they looked great on her and are an excellent little shoe for the price - very cute!"
Perfect for me for doing soccer and weight lifting with room for extra clothes as the weather changes
"What a great suit! Can be used for other occasions, not just as a costume."
Loved it! It was perfect!
"Exactly what I thought they would look like, very cute and the engraving was accurate. They have a nice heavy feel in the hand. You will want to buy a better neck chain as the ball chain provided cheapens the effect (it's the same as you use on a ceiling fan or light fixture).
Giving these to online book club friends I am meeting for the first time."
"These arrived very quickly and my husband loves them. They fit just right. I can't afford for them to shrink in length so I'll have them dry cleaned. They can be machine washed.  I wished these would have been available in a 34"" length.  They are just long enough for my husband who is 6' 3"" tall."
my granddaughter  and I love it it's very nice !
Very happy and pleased with the quality of these leggings. Nice waistband and good comfy fit. Fun bright colors.
These boots are great work boots I'm a mechanic and I'm always on my feet so I need something comftable they bother a little at first till they brake in but that's normal
Fits great and they are comfortable !
High waisted not great unless you have a flat tummy. DO NOT put in the wash!! They pill and ruin. Hand wash only! Thick and warm though. Good price.
"This is my third pair of LB Evans Deerking slippers that I have used over the last 25 years. This pair is the first made in China. They look exactly like my older ones did when they were new. I hope they last as long. The Deerking slippers are the toughest, most comfortable slipper I have ever tried."
"I was so happy when this product arrived it was way more than I expected. The fit was amazing I have skinny legs so I was not sure how these wedge sneakers would look on me but trust me guys if you are not buying these shoes your making a big mistake specially I love the ones from this brand they look amazing the material of the shoes does not look cheap at all they fit as per expected so you do not have to worry about the size, whatever size you are normally just order the same and the fit would be the same believe me the only thing about the shoes is the lace is too big but I do not feel any discomfort with that as I am so much in love with these shoes and this brand that I will definitely order them again. If you want to try wedge sneakers try ordering it from Amazon specially this particular brand they are comfortable, trendy, they go with jeans, skirts, dresses in fact you can even go clubbing with these trust me they are really cute and comfy and your legs won't hurt how it does when you wear those ridiculously high heels switch to sneakers girlies a big thumps up for these shoes"
My son loves this tee!
"I bought this to wear under my ""beanie"" motorcycle helmet. It is perfect. Good quality, should last a long time."
Cute girls bathing suit.  It held up well to frequent use.
Cant go wrong with MK baby...6th watch from him...THanks and I got it for 284.00
"Beautiful watch!!!  Bought it for my mother-in-law's birthday.  The box came all beat up and dented.  I contacted Amazon to get a replacement and was I ever glad that I did that.  Apparently the beat up first one was missing extra links.  When the new one came, I opened the package to check it and immediately saw that the band was longer and there was a plastic wrap to protect the watch.  So kudos to the Amazon customer service!  Now seeing it's so nice, I'll probably wait and see if it goes back on sale at some point and get another one for myself.  It's definitely worth the sale price.  If I didn't get it on sale, lack of waterproofing prob would be a deal killer for me. But as a gift, you can't beat a more elegant one for the lightning deal price!"
Kind of tight near the foot but OK. Pretty.
This is beautiful and was a gift after a dance performance for my granddaughter.
"I have a small wide foot with a bunion, these are cute but not for me.  I liked the small wedge, padded bottom, and ease to slip-on without opening buckle strap.  The blue screen color was brighter than what I received; the shade is more muted and more like washed denim.  The size 5 was a bit short in the toe and the width was a bit snug; I imagine they might stretch in time but I don't buy shoes that need to be ""broken in."""
Too cute!  Got this for my 9yo daughter... I know  will love it!
Good value. I am comfy and well supported all day.
"Beautiful Satin Gloves. Perfect for 1st Communion for a girl. They are very well made, for perfectly and are very soft. Great purchase. I am super excited and happy"
Perfect final touch!
These turned out really cute.
"This is just gorgeous. It would make a great gift for mother's day or birthday.

The gems and gold are bright. The ""created"" gems are just as beautiful as ""natural"" gems. The clasp is a bit unusual (but we don't buy a lot of jewelry), but not a problem. It's actually a little more delicate-appearing in person than it is in the image. Very nice.

It is currently unavailable on Amazon, but well worth it once it comes back."
"I really like this belt.  I only gave 4 start because I think it could have been less expensive for the materials and how it's constructed.  But, alas, I couldn't make it myself, so it was worth it."
Great flip flop if you like a little lift. The arch support is nice also. Much more comfortable than the typical flat flip flop.
I love how these pants fit. I would have given them 5 stars but the color looks more of an ink blue than a black that I ordered. I will keep them though.
"Nice classic Casio that pairs really nicely with a NATO H3rrington strap. Red, white, & blue for you! (It's really difficult to snap the spring-bar back on over the strap but it does work! How I did it was to put one side of the spring-bar back in, slide the strap under, then use a writing pen with the tip retracted back into the barrel, to press the other side of the spring-bar on top of the vinyl cloth till it snapped into place.) Good luck.

Edit: I'm changing the rating to 4 stars because the only stainless steel part is the backing and the rest of body of the watch is actually a pretty cheap coated plastic. I dropped the watch maybe 3 feet and it nicked the side instantly, which wouldn't happen to steel. It's still a good deal for the money but I'd happily pay more for an actual metal body."
"This wallet was for my boyfriend. He likes it overall, the color is more brown-gray than gray and the pockets are pretty tight. It is a good, functional wallet for him."
"EDIT: The sizes varies from the different colors. The plain denim (black/blue) actually stretch more, are more true to size than the black/blue storm leggings. It's like they are two totally different jeggings.

The quality of these pants are really like jeans, instead of the regular leggings. They don't stretch much like stated. I ordered these in my size, and they are VERY tight. I expected them to be smaller, but have more of a stretch to them. I know I will have to break these in before I wear them out of the house. The seller shipped these really quickly, and I am happy with my transaction otherwise. Try to buy a size bigger if you plan on buying these."
"Good buy for a big guy, true to size and great quality. For this price they can't be beat."
My favorite butterfly.  This piece is so stunning it goes with anything you are wearing.  This photo does not do its justice.  Looks better in person.
Nice shorts great price.
Good fit and exactly what I expected.
"Very nice piece for the price. The back being hallow is expected, but prevented 5 stars"
"I really love this dress! Wore it to a wedding and received lots of compliments, and many were surprised I got it off of Amazon! I bought a size 8 first, and was surprised on how huge it was on me! I'm 5' 8"" 130 lbs and 34D bust. I bought the 6 and the 4 and the 4 was the winner! It was still very long and needed to be hemmed. I was not expecting that kind of quality with the dress.

The one major downside was the zipper. I had to hold the dress perfectly straight to zip it. It wouldn't budge if there was any bump in the zipper track. Pretty annoying!"
"I got the Medium, order smaller due to the flow of the dress. It fits perfect! Love the mauve color, it looks so sexy. My husband said it it flowed just right & i looked sexy in it. Made me feel cute."
These shoes fit well and provided a comfortable run from the start.  I now have about 150 miles on them and although they've broken in a bit and started to show some heal wear they have become my favorite running shoes.  They are interesting looking but the colors are a bit more muted in person than they look in the product photo.
"Really cute. I can't wait to see
them on my nephew"
"I have serious foot problems, including bunions, and can't wear most pumps or heels. These have been wonderful because they are presentable enough to wear in a ""dressy casual"" office environment, yet are completely comfortable. The footbed is very flexible; you can bend the shoe almost in two. Be warned that they do look a little bit like slippers, but if you are unable to wear most ""dressier"" shoes you can get by with these in complete comfort. I think they would also be good for pregnant women who need a safe and comfortable flat that's more dressy than flip flops or standard crocs."
This dress is amazing but the fabric will be too hot for summer so I wear the heck out of it in spring.
I had a previous pair in a different color and enjoyed the support for everyday wear while I work (as a nurse) and to work out in. This was a repeat purchase and I am equally as pleased.
501's need I say more
My husband is very pleased with item.  The sandals fit just right and this is the second pair that I've purchased for him (the other pair is a similar pair made by Nike).  I highly recommend this item for young and old.
"These Duco sunglasses are Uber-stylish at a reasonable price point.  I wore these glasses on a mini-vacation to Santa Barbara and was ACTUALLY asked the brand name by a woman on the pier.  I confessed that I was testing them to do a product review and her comment was that Id scored a hundred dollar pair of glasses.  I did fess up and gave her the web site.

After playing to my vanity it is important to point out that aside from looking good these glasses seem well constructed.  They are polarized and many equate that to reducing the glare when driving but its also good for folks like me who are often on or near a body of water.  The reflective glare of the sun bouncing on the waters surface can actually give you a headache.  These Ducos practically negated all the glare of a bright sunny day on the ocean in SoCal.

They come in a hard case which is another plus  you don't have to worry about them getting squished in your purse or pocket.  The case even has a little carabiner so you can attach the case to your handbag or belt loop.  This is a very well designed addition to the product and proves to me that the designer has put a lot of effort into this item.  Im very impressed with these sunglasses  from the way the product is fabricated and merchandised with all the extras to the design which makes this granny look fabulous, darling."
it was more than I expected loved it....
"Love the print! I am 5'0"" and 178# and I ordered a XXXL and it fits well. The only issue was the breast cups. I read many reviews that side the cups are small and I 100% agree. Don't get me wrong, it covers most of my boobs, but does show some major clevage. With this fit, it will be more of a lay out or light swim kind of day. Your boobs will fall out if you try to do any major swimming. Overall I liked what I got for the price. Only paid $13 for it since they were running a sale at the time, so I believe I got my money's worth."
"Very nice.

Good quality, fit as expected.
Comfortable and good looking. Exactly what I wanted.
Winter is comming!!!!!
I will buy another to my brother."
"I have light olive skin, when I first rolled it on, it looked a tad too orangey for my skin tone. When I smoothed it on and it looked good and I could barely see it.  I really like that the stick is wide and thick, so you can you use it on big areas. It was easy to adjust the height and it goes down easily. I bruise easily, so I rubbed this over the smaller one, smoothed it, and I could barely see it. I also tried it on the bigger one, I had to use a lot more."
PERFECT!!!! They screw one very tight! These are the ONLY earrings that my daughter can wear. Her earrings that she got from the Drs when she got her ears pierced were causing her ears to ooze. I put these in and her ears were fine! AMAZING COMPANY & AMAZING EARRINGS!!!!!
"Very comfortable, very flowy and long. I would suggest buying a size down. I'm normally an xl, but I think a large would have fit better."
"I didn't like the cut too much, it didn't fall on me as in the photo. I'm tall and for some reason it was shorter than the photo but also the hole for the shoulder didn't have that pretty draped look, it look more like just a hold on the shoulder."
"Very good product, I liked it, it's very confortable... The fabric is soft, warm, and it's very easy to dress it. Didn't change shape or lost colors after washing."
I bought these for my grandson who put them right on and said they fit well(size 11 1/2 shoe)  No idea on how they wear.
"These shoes look every bit as good as in the pictures and came at a good price. I have not had them long enough to see how well they hold up, but they are very comfortable. The only drawbacks I can see is that they will get dirty very easily. Also, the soles are made of a funky synthetic material so I doubt these would be good running shoes for someone who runs often.  Great for walking, though! I will update this review after extended use."
"Several years ago I decided to purchase digital time pieces in lieu of the high dollar name brand watches.  And, always searching for the ideal low cost, large dial digital watch.  The specifications and size of the Armitron Sport Men's Analog-Digital Chronograph Navy Blue Watch filled my needs, especially the fact I can wear it in the pool, and the order placed.  The 5157(Navy) arrived in a neat gift type box, including a detailed step-by-step pictorial user manual. Setting up was easy following the instruction sheet. The analog iridescent green hands/sweep was set to the correct time, then the  digital time was set to Phoenix time - watch was preset to the correct day/date; Am pleased with the size, band and overall looks of the watch. Feels great with a easy to read  digital time.  A real bargain - highly recommended

Additional Armitron information:

  Navy blue resin case with silver-tone top ring; analog-digital display with time, seconds, day and date; navy blue resin strap with buckle closure
  Functions include: chronograph, lap time, alarm, dual time, military time and backlight with three second delay
  Japanese-quartz Movement
  Case Diameter: 52.5mm
  Water Resistant - 330 feet"
"Fits a size bigger than expected, 18 mo size fits when other brands' 2T clothes fit.  Thick, high quality fabric. Cute fit."
Nice blouses - very pretty colors
"This company is very customer orientated. My satisfaction was second only to the quality of the ring itself. After guessing my ring size twice, I had to return for exchange. Improper size was my fault completely but Metal Masters stuck with me until I was satisfied with my purchase. Kept in contact thru emails and even phone calls. I can't say enough about these guys. THEY ROCK. The ring is also beautiful. Very high quality ring. This was my second ring from these guys."
"Even though the strap is made out of some type of rubber, it looks dressy and it does not pull at the hairs on my hubby's arm. He is a doorman at a luxury hotel here in NYC and works outside so this is perfect for him. He loves it. He praises it all the time and he gets compliments."
I am a female.  I purchased this bracelet for myself.  It is hard to find a thick chain link bracelet for women in a 7 1/2 inch length.  So I thought to try this out.  I love this bracelet.  It does not look masculine.  The bracelet looks so good on my wrist.  I was happy with the service provided by this seller.  Really nice bracelet.  A really great price.  I will purchase from this seller again.
These were good for the price. Although I'm surprised that they weren't more stretchy since they are suppose to be one size fits all.
"I own two of these shirts now (one pink, one blue) and have worn them EVERY SINGLE DAY for the last 4 weeks since my double mastectomy. They are absolutely perfect for wrangling those annoying JP drains, the material is very soft against delicate skin and scars, and the Velcro closure makes them easy to put on and remove when you have extremely limited range of motion. The only drawbacks are the colors (personally, I DESPISE the color pink), the material can absorb sweat odors (but washes beautifully, so order to so you can wear one while you wash the other), and the Velcro snags on the material no matter how carefully you try to handle them. While I am finally having my drains removed this week and will be able to wear other shirts again, I will certainly be saving these for my final reconstruction surgery in the coming months. My surgical team have been blown away by these shirts when I come in for my post-op appointments, and my plastic surgeon now has a flyer for these shirts at her registration desk so that her other patients can learn about them"
Ordered a set for a trip. They are durable and allowed me to pack other items in with my shoes without the lingering concern of my heels piercing into my garments or leaving unpleasant traces in my luggage. I found them worth the purchase.
"This does not feel like cashmere to me, but has a good fit and seems to be good quality manufacturing.  I feel like this was a little expensive for the texture of the material.  It is a little itchy on my skin.  I debated sending it back, but have decided that as it fits good I will give it a try.  The label says hand washable and I have heard that good cashmere gets softer with time.  Only time will tell.
As to size it seemed true to fit.  I ordered my normal size and this fit like a glove.  Order shipped slow, took 5 days to get my 2 day shipping delivered.  However, I ordered at the busy after-Christmas season so that was probably a factor."
"Liked the patterns, fits eyeglasses & sunglasses."
I've always been happy with every purchase from Neon Buddha. The jacket fits perfectly and the color of the jacket compliments every color in my wardrobe. The jacket is comfortable and hangs nicely.
"These are nice everyday socks. They did seem a bit longer than most, which is great, since my son is at the top of the size range. They aren't very cushioned, but the quality seems good, especially for the price."
Cute skirt - nice cut with pleats that fall just right. Not to short...not too long.  And a great value!
"not sure why I haven't tried wool socks before in the cold ~ I could have actually enjoyed the wintertime!  These are on the shorter side, like crew socks, but honestly, they keep my feet and legs nice and toasty.  Not great looking, but I'm happy just being warm!  Haven't washed these yet, but I will exercise some care doing that."
"Second pair my wife has purchased, fit better than any other and have a nice silky feel to them."
Very cute quick shipment
"Though these looked bigger to me in the photos than they are in person, I still just love them.  One easily could wear them in a 2nd hole, and wear a larger stone in the first hole of one's ear.  Small enough to wear for daytime, but still enough to be stylish at night, too.  I would recommend them."
It's really nice. I love the color and size is perfect
"I had a pair of these and the little nubs are coming off all over the place and they are only 7 months old.  I do not keep them in the sun either.  I like them so much though I bought another pair.  I noticed the upper (part you put your foot into) is thinner and not padded like the pair I already have, and it's rubbing my big toes raw on top, never had this problem with the older pair, but I'm guessing my toe will get used to it eventually."
"Easy to do business with, shirt super cute.  Fit great"
Great item for the winter
Great bag - not too big and fits everything.  Lightweight and durable.  I will get a lot of use out of this bag.
"They're lovely! Feels so soft & drapey. But I'm currently exchanging the pair I ordered, because I couldn't even get them on. I usually wear a small, but I'm going to need a large."
"This top is great.  I like the fabric.  It is very light and easy to wear on a hot day.  The medium fits me well.  Sometimes I wear small.  So when in doubt, order the larger size."
"Well made fitted hat. Looks exactly like picture. Style is slightly tall. OK for an old guy like me, but I don't see young guys liking the style very much. I have 3 of these now in different colors & I like them all very much. Style, fit, quality is consistent  Shipping time was quick on all 3.
 I prefer fitted caps because I have a large head & the adjustable ones are nearly always small looking on my head, & the adjustment strap is always hanging up on shoulder straps (camera, binoculars, etc.)."
"my 3yo girl loves these, light summer PJs"
I love the necklace but it's to small for my neck. I ordered the 16' in when I should have ordered the 18'in. I ended up having to buy an extender for it. Next time I'll order the 18'.
"These boots, although they run a bit large, they couldn't be more comfortable! I wore them for a 3 hour drive for a Doctor's Appt, spent about 3 hours walking around a massive Hospital; this would normally take a major toll on my feet. However, even with the 3 hour drive home, my feet felt terrific!"
I think I've worn these every day this summer. I get a lot of compliments on them too.
They are just perfect..got size 9 for my 3 yr old and she loves it. These are pretty warm though and I noticed some fur shredding during first use just a few strands.
I'm really happy with this one!
"The ring is exactly like pictured.  You receive an authenication of the amber in the ring, which is nice. I have large fingers and the ring sizing is perfect for me."
"While this took what seemed like forever to arrive, it was within the expected delivery date. I got the Galaxy B print. The colors are bright and the print is beautiful. The shirt is soft and comfortable and like other reviewers said, its a thinner material. Its not super thin but its not a sweatshirt. I personally like the fact the fabric is thinner because it allows me to wear it on a warmer day without overheating. The fit was perfect for me. It had some extra room but it wasn't oversize.  I'm 5.5""  without shoes and weigh about 125. I usually wear a size small. The sleeves were just the right length on my arms. I would've liked for them to be long enough to go over my hands a bit but they are just long enough to cover my wrists. If you have a longer arm span the sleeves will probably be too short. There are no tags on the shirt at all. To figure out which side is the front I have to line up the solder seam to see which side of the neckline is lower. Also since there are no tags there are no care instructions. I will be hand washing it just to be safe. It was worth ever dollar for me, I love it!"
"These fit my ears perfectly. Great quality and look awesome. I've had them for over a month and never take off. No skin reactions, and they stay in place."
"It is hard to find a better boot then anything made by Danner.  They perform wel, stable and feel much like a great running shoe rather than a boot.  No break in time needed"
Cute fun comfy shoe!
Love the way they fit and how comfortable they are.  The thing I like least about them is that I have cats and they are a hair magnet.
"this little wallet is awesome! Looks very classy and can be used as a clutch. I have a toddler so I don't like bringing my purse and my son's diaper bag with me everywhere so this little baby is perfect to hold my phone, keys, lip gloss, cash, cards and keys!  I love it. The leather is soft and it looks designer but fits the budget of a Target shopper. Buy it - you don't regret it!"
But I have a big head and a lot of hair. The hat is so light it floats on my head . I will have to pin it. It is pretty and perfect for a church ladies tea. The wire at the rim allows you to give it your own style.
Love my new Doc's! Cute as ever!
"Beautiful and made of solid material. Hard to hook, though. Very pleased!"
"Super cute! High quality. Comfortable. Love love love! Run a smudge big. I usually wear a 7-8 so I got a 7.5 and wish I would have got a 7. They'll fit great with no-show socks though. Plus, if I exchanged I would have to wait to wear them and that's just not happening!"
"Beautiful shirt,fits well,made well"
Absolutely love these glasses! Great design and feel. Plenty of variety of colors to choose from!
"They fit great and are really cute. My son loved that they looked like police cars and light up. It's also an added bonus when you are outside after sunset - makes it easy to spot your toddler LOL
The only negative thing that I have to say about these shoes, is that the material is a little plastic looking and not very flexible. However, my son still enjoyed these shoes for quite a while."
Very beautiful dress and great quality . It runs very large .
Much bigger than I expected it to be. Nice little piece though.
"I LOVE these...light weight and very comfortable to wear.  I really like this style of  ""hook"" SO easy to use, nearly impossible to accidentally lose them.  I really will get a lot of use from these.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone, and feel they would be an appreciated gift."
Great deal.  comfortable and good looking
"I did a shopping comparison of Comfortable Club with another online retailer of undies. I love them both, but found a few differences.  I'm 5' 8"", 120+ lbs, and the Mediums fit snugly. At first I was concerned there would be indentations at the thighs and hips, but either I shrank or the elastic relaxed just enough after first washing.  They are super soft and comfortable, as the name suggests. Tight enough around the thigh that they won't ride up.  When putting on tights, of course you have to help them not to roll, but on their own they're just fine.  The waist-band sits just above the hipbones for me, which I like, so they don't feel like they're going to slip down either.  The other retailer's boyshorts sat just below the hipbones, and were a looser fit, which I found more prone to riding up or slipping down.  So for half the price, Comfortable Club will be a go-to for me! The only minus is that the crotch does not seem to have a cotton insert, just a double layer of the modal fabric (which is also natural)."
"Have been looking for this style for YEARS!  I wanted to replace the pair that I purchased back in the late 90s. Wore them out, and had been hanging on to the original pair way past their expired tread time.  Even tried several other Merrill zipper shoes hoping to find the same comfort and durability.  While the others are just fine, the style of the Barrado (that's another thing I didn't know - the style #.  I'll pay more attention from now on) is what I love.  White stitching on black is great.  Thanks for bringing it back (if it ever was gone)."
"Even though it's a bit big, it's cute."
Fits as expected and is durable.
"A little smaller than I was expecting, but I like snug slippers as I walk up and down stairs a lot at home. Good quality though and very cute!"
"This shirt was the perfect fit for me, and I wear a medium.  It has nice detail on the cuffs, it has another pattern there, so if you flip up your cuffs they will provide a nice accent.  The fabric is surprisingly soft.  The grey pattern is very fine and detailed.
Overall I am really much more pleased than I thought i would be.

The shirt is very short, and probably meant to be worn out.  if you were to tuck it in, and then bend over, you could expect it to pull out. However, given the way the shirt is cut, I think its supposed to be worn out like a casual long sleeve shirt."
Have not had occasion to wear them as of this date. Pleased with purchase.
"This is a great watch link remover.
Yes, the item has a cheap and rather plastic-y feel about it, but that's because it IS cheap to buy.
I really like the elevation adjustment knob, which slides a board under the watch strap to raise or lower it, to match it up with the pins.
A watch link remover I had before had a spring board for you to press, which made it very awkward to adjust straps, and often caused bent needles because the spring board would cause the watch band to misaslign with the needle.
The height adjustment on this solves that problem.
The needles are quite soft and bend on harder link pins, but they are designed this way so that you do not damage your timepiece.  Really not a downfall of the product, especially when replacement needles can be had for $2 for a package of ten.

Great tool for adjusting metal watch bands!"
"Man I love the cover so much. It look gorgeous on me. The color is very rich and so beautiful. I was a little worried about the color. I wasn't sure what to get. Usually I get color like black or grey for cover ups. But I thought this would be a nice change of pace and give a little diversity to my wardrobe.

 I was totally right and as soon as I go it i fell in love with it. It goes with almost anything. I really like to pair it with darker colors because it really shows off the color. It also does really well with all white both complementing each other very nicely.

The fabric it is made out of is ridiculously soft I have a bit of an addiction to touching it. Every Time it brushes against my skin Im reminded of its awesome texture. The cover up is very well made. The stitching on it was perfect and sturdy. It also did very well in the wash.

After washing it I dried it on delicate. It came out with its same vibrant color no sign of wear or loss in softness. I was really happy with the quality of this. The way it hangs is perfect it not too heavy so it still flowy when your walking. If you get a little cold it has enough material to wrap yourself up a bit and prove a little warmth.

I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This does not affect the time, effort and integrity I put into a review that would be beneficial to any fellow customer. I have no relationship with sellers and manufacturers. I base all my reviews on quality, value, and personal experience of the product."
I love the style of the shoes and they are comfortable!
"I love it! But as many other people said, it did run VERY small. I ordered my usual size but wish I went up a size or two. If I order again I'll probably go up two sizes."
"Appears to be a good quality well designed costume.

I have not laundered it yet which is why I've given 4 stars. Will update review as appropriate."
"I love these trousers! I am 120 lbs, 27"" waist, 37"" hip. Almost all of that 37 is located in the caboose, so I have the most terrible time finding pants. I have literally tried on hundreds. The only thing I found recently that wouldnt gap in the back or pull down when I sit was very high waisted jeggings. Problem with that is, Im not really comfortable with the tightness of jeggings.

Enter Lee Modern Series Curvy Fit Maxwell Trousers! I ordered size 4 and these are nearly perfect for me. Just a tad bit large maybe. The fabric is comfy and soft and stretchy, so the stretchiness of the fabric allows these pants to hug my waist in the back but also stretch to cover my bum. And the higher cut in back and lower cut in front means the pants don't pull down in the back when I sit!

The four stars comes from the fact that the fabric does attract lint. Ive gotten both khaki and midnight rinse, and the khaki color is much better for this. The fabric on the darker colored pair also feels a bit thin, so Ill be wearing them in the warmer months only.

The only pants Ive found that fit in a comparable way are the Lee Modern Series Curvy Fit Miranda Straight Leg Jeans. They are absolutely perfect. The Lee Modern Series Curvy Fit Adrian Bootcut Jean works well also, but the waist is a bit larger, creating the need for a belt. Lee is now my favorite brand! Please don't ever stop making these!"
Beautiful earrings...just the right size...great quality
"First jacket too small, returning it & ordering another in a larger size. Gorgeous quality "
Love love love these shoes. All I will be wearing working at the school.
was as decribed and fit geat will see further on the fun it causes . thanx for a good shoe and present.
Favorite casual watch....so much so that I purchased an orange one and a lime green one.  Soooo easy to read and I can wear it in the pool.  It's comfortable and it's fun.
As described and the fit was great!
nice but wasn't too crazy for it so i returned it
These were bought for 2 year-old twins and they are cute as the kids. I bought them in pink and blue.
I love my pajamas. Very good quality and nice plaid color. Very soft and cozy. I am short (5 5) so The pants a bit long for me. Still love my pj. Will buy again.
great shoes!  my daughter loves these.
I love this bag! So functional and stylish. I was able to fit everything I needed and had a little extra room to spare. Definitely would recommend.
Love these! I so wish I had found them when I was nursing my first. Nice thicker material than most of the other camis I've bought.
"Just got it yesterday. Washed last night. Came out of the dryer looking good.
As per prior reviews it runs a little small. Normally a 2x guy. Ordered 3x and it's good. Can't figure out why they put those flaps under the buttons and holes. Not sewen down.
Wearing this weekend to a carnival party. Will see how it performs."
I have several pairs of shoes from this company and these were just what I wanted- I justed need brown.  Most comfortaBle shoes ever.  I have plantar fasciitis and it doesn't flare up when i wear these
Really nice. Fits well.
Love ..love..love these boots
Best thing since Crocs!
"Great product, but it was too small for my hands. I normally wear medium gloves"
I bought this last year to wear as a sarong at the lake and it flew out the boat on our way home... of course I had to buy another to replace it for this year.. it's perfect.
This is a nice looking jacket. I returned it because i had a jacket with the same color.  The tailoring was fine. It is a well made jacket.
"I read some of the reviews before ordering and they had suggested to go a size and a half up. I am typically a 7 to 7 1/2 so I purchased an 8. They fit perfect, almost like a sock. This way I do not have to worry about them slipping off. I even have a little room in the toe area, I even have wider feet but they were great! I thought a size and a half would be way to much. I have been wearing them all week for three or more hours at a time for dance and have had no issues. Much more comfortable than other jazz shoes that I have had."
Fit was great. I love that these slacks come all the way to my natural waist line! Just wish you had additional colors available!
"Just rub a bit on the top of the foot. Otherwise, I love them."
I was doubtful of the quality at this price point. The watch is really quite nice.  It is elegant but goes well with business casual also.  The bezel is nice and heavy however the band is probably it's only weakness. If you have hairy wrists be prepared to deal with constant hair pulls.  The links separate slightly on the edges of the band causing the problem. I will most likely change the band however overall I'm still happy with the purchase at this price.
"I order a size larger than usual, and I'm glad I did...

Cool shirt, though! Quality is OK, but it runs at least a half size small. Order accordingly!"
Adorable but thought unordered a youth XL and it's more like a men's large
"The Long Way Fashion Jewelry Co Water-drop Pendant and Earrings set is beautiful.  I chose the silver plated. Even though I am too close to 50 years old and the majority of my jewelry has been gold, I have been leaning towards silver like most people seem to these days. The silver also seems neutral to me and I feel like you can wear it with pretty much any color outfit and it will match. The set's pieces are actually larger in person than I had anticipated they were going to be. (A plus for me)  The set also comes in a nice (perfect for gift-giving) box with a ribbon tie. The tear-drop shape is beautiful and very classic and with the addition of the faux pearls and crystals, I think it would be perfect for a dressier occasion.  I love the beautiful chain as well.  The chain will give you a maximum length of 20 inches with the 2 inch extender that it has on it.  The chain, although it feels very strong, has a very pretty delicate look to it. The earring backs have the plastic round disc that lies flush against your ear and than the additional back and when on feel very secure in my ears.  I plan on wearing this beautiful set with my Christmas dress. I was fortunate to receive this product at no cost during a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"I really love the material used. Figures cause it's made in egypt. My first time to own clothing made there. The only problem is that it's way to huge. I ordered a small but feels like a medium, or maybe a large even. I still haven't used it yet, probably have to gain a lot of pounds first or just give it to my dad."
arrived as promised - originally ordered medium a little to tight but my daughter took it and I ordered another in large fits great nice fabric reasonable price
"i received in time; i like this shoes because look great,glam,nice and i received too much compliment
is very comfort i used for work,dance and i really am very happy
i recomend this all lady that is holyshoes because i am fans 9west"
Dress came as described. Maybe even a little more detailed than I expected. Wore it for an old Hollywood glamour party and it fit in well. Material is OK. Easily becomes static cling; not overly heavy in weight.
Very cute but I read the reviewd and ordered a size larger than what my child wears and it fit like I wanted it to.
Love all Columbia and this is typical Columbia quality combined w/stylish fabric and colors.  Looks like purple fire works. Lightweight and well make. Looks like it will shed water too.  True to size.
"This watch has everything I have been looking for in a sport/casual watch including rose gold, roman numerals, chronograph, knock-out looks. I had checked it out at the department store and wasn't real pleased with the rubber watch band for the Las Vegas summer heat. I see others have commented the band also. This problem is easily solved. Order the band on the Bulova Marine Star Model Number 98B103 which is perforated black leather and costs under $[...] including postage directly from the Bulova parts department on the phone [...] and you will have a good quality watch that, as far as appearance goes, can't be beat at any price. Also, the leather band is about 1 1/2 inch shorter and much lighter for the slightly smaller wrist, and has a much nicer buckle with a more deeply engraved Bulova Tuning Fork symbol. The rubber band is huge and quite heavy. To sum it up, you can't go wrong with this Bulova watch."
Fits wonderfully! It's hard for me to get boots that fit right and comfortable!
"I bought them as a b-day gift, was not sure what to expect but she loves them!"
"Gorgeous and what a great price. It arrived beautifully wrapped and boxed, which added to the thrill when my daughter, the bride, received it. It was almost exactly like the $320 one she wanted from Anthropolgie- for $20! Wow!"
Lots of compliments.  It's wonderful.
"I like costumes.  I have so much fun wearing them.  I ended up choosing the red - same color the model wears, because it works well with black, etc.  I have big hair and a big head and it even fits me.  It's bendable, its very groovy looking and its a bargain.  I bet I end up buying another one or two.  You'll love it."
"i purchased this to hold my keys, phone and epi pen in while out exploring hands free. It does the job."
"Nice, run of the mill quality suit.  Definitely can't compete with high end brands--fabric not as hefty, craftsmanship average. But this suit is too short!  I'm 5' 8"", and this suit came up below my breasts--definitely didn't cover up enough to be decent (didn't cover even the lower 1/3 of my boobs).  Would be a pretty good suit for short ladies, or those with short torsos only."
Comfy and perfect true-to-size fit. Thank you!
They fit as Iexpeced  they would.  Reasonable price.
"I usually don't pay this much for shoes, but after purchasing some Aetrex athletic shoes on clearance, I was hooked.  These sandals are very cute, and I get complimented all the time.  I have high arches and these feel very comfortable.  The only thing that I could say is a negative is that the velcro came unsewed on one side after I had them a few weeks; thus, only four stars.  I didn't want to bother returning them, so I used gorilla glue to put the velcro back in place.  All's well.  LOVE THESE sandals."
"This is exactly what I was looking for in a leopard scarf.  It is soft - not scratchy - does not pull easily - wraps around very nicely.  There is a front and back, the back being a lighter version print of the front, but does not bother me at all and not much noticeable anyway.  It is well made! Highly recommend!"
Way better quality than expected! I could not have made this dress for the price/time it would have taken. My daughter LOVED it for a formal party we went to (worn with additional hoop skirt under for volume).
"Fit me like a glove, but they were super long and I had them hemmed. I'm 5'4"" and 137 lbs.  I got a size 6."
Unfortunately this style Sanuk is too short and there are no 1/2 sizes. Other Sanuks I have are very comfortable and my feet are on vacation while wearing them.
"I ordered this in an XXL b/c so many XLs have seemed skimpy lately.  This shirt is roomy.  The fabric is soft but not clingy. The armholes and sleeves are ample.  I'm overweight around the middle, but my shoulders are muscular. Often in XL sizes, I find that the armholes are too small and the sleeves too tight. The color was more a peachy rust than an orange rust, otherwise I'd have ordered a size smaller.  If there were more colors in that I liked, I'd be ordering away right now.  This is a high quality shirt.  If you like the colors, go for it!  I am female.  Somehow my husband's name has become associated with my reviews as well as his own."
"This came in almost a salmon color, but was still very flattering, especially with some color. I have this dress in three colors and it is extremely flattering.  I have a little bit of a belly bulge but the ruching is fabulous at concealing.  It is great for a curvy lady and actually made one of the People Style magazine's best dresses for curvy or plus size ladies.  I bought one in petite for a coworker and she loved it just as much as a size 6-8.  Has some stretch to it so it moves very well.  The neckline is interesting enough that a necklace is not even necessary, but works well if you would like to wear it.  Obviously I love this dress and can't say enough about it.  I wore a red one for a Christmas party and it was almost a ""pin up"" style with its modest length but extremely curve enhancing cut.  Got tons of compliments and made this size 14 lady feel like a cover model!"
My daughter loved these. Great fit
"Warm, well made, exactly what I wanted"
Nicely done. Gonna be great on cold days here...
Pretty shoe. Metallic yellow gold. Runs a 1/2 size big.
"I usually have trouble getting boots to fit my feet right.  If they are large enough in the toe area, they are too big elsewhere.  These boots fit me like a glove!  Very comfortable; no having to wear them in.  I was afraid they would be too clunky to look feminine but again, they surprised me and look very nice.  The only thing about these boots that I would change would be having the zipper on the inside of the boot rather than on the back.  However, they are so comfortable and so nice looking that I can easily overlook that.  All in all, a great all around boot and I would recommend that you try them."
"I bought this for my 10 year old daughter.  She is tall, so I bought her a size 12.  It's a little big, but not so big that she looks ridiculous wearing it.  It's a really nice quality.  The lining gives it some warmth making it perfect for cold, raining days.  It's even cuter in person than it is online."
love it. So cute. Used for my bridesmaids in my wedding.
My husband loves this. It's a loose fit and looks exactly like picture. The medium size fit him and he wears size 33 waist
"As stated by other reviewers this runs small!  Ordered the 3T for my 20 month old son and it fit well besides the ""leggings"" being too long.  I ended up cutting off the feet of the leggings as they were too tight around my sons legs and feet.  Besides the size issue this was SO cute on him and such a great little outfit."
Way more comfortable than expected and they are stylish too.
"I got this dress for my wife, and she loves it. It fits her well. It's made of sturdy material, and definitely feels like it will last a long time."
"Great bag to hold my Venum Muay Thai pads and Venum Focus mits, as well as my other misc gear."
For the $20 buck or whatever this dress cost.....it was well worth it.  Very soft and comfy!  I ordered one for my mom as well!
Iit's very comfortable and beautiful.i like tzem.
"These are so soft, my son loved them and my daughter tries to sneak them so she can wear them."
Looks and works well. I like it for the good looks and the reasonable price
This case is the friggin bomb. I can get my cards out and in fast so I don't like like an old lady taking forever to fit my card in my wallet slot. The amount of pockets for cash and/or checks is awesome.
"I used this bag on a trip to London and it's great. I like how you can carry it behind you or in front of you due to the ability to switch which side the strap hooks on to the bottom of the bag. It well padded also, and has ample space for a camera, leaflets/brochures, a portable battery, a small water bottle, pens/pencils, notebooks, a passport, etc.

Outside travel, I've also used it for work and work outs during light days. It's a really well-made versatile bag."
Super comfortable bra. As a large chested woman pre-pregnacy (usually 36DDD) I was very pleased with the amount of support this bra offered. If I need to just run a quick errand I don't have to change into one of my uncomfortable underwire ones. It is very comfortable to sleep in also. I have a feeling I'll be wearing this long after I finish nursing!
Sneakers are perfect for wide feet!
Ordered for my 9 month old grandson who is kinda chunky and it fit perfect and he was as cute as a button.
"Fit perfect! 5'2"" weigh 118- 120lbs.. I ordered a small short. They fit perfect! Enough room for layers underneath but not too bulky to wear a single layer. Length is good with boots I'm no dragging on ground but not high waters either. Can't wait for colder weather..well, I can..I retract that statement."
"Great; soft fabric, beautiful design, oversized and comfy (5'5"" 127lbs) Highly recommended for the modern day hippie"
"I had ordered this for my younger sister. At this price, I figured it'll be a simple, cheapy piece. I'm an accessory-holic, and generally, jewelry at this price give away its value and look according to price I spent.

But WOW! Just WOW!

This Besteel necklace looks anything but cheap!

The chain is a medium thickness and Very strong. When I wear it, it comes down to the center of my chest, but where it hits will depend on each individual.

The chain and pendant are packaged separately, and it's very simple to put together.

The initial pendant is a beautifully large size! I ordered the letter R which is about 1"" in height and 1 1/4"" in width. I'm not sure of this measurement, but the thickness is also generous. It won't bend or break.

This necklace is beautifully glossy, lending it a real gold look.

Included is a black jewelry pouch, which makes for super easy gift giving!

Age-wise, I'd say it's perfect for adults and teens alike. Since the pendant is generously large, it may seem inappropriate for a young child. However it all depends on the size and clothes of the individual, but my opinion is that it's for (pre)teens and above. Definitely makes a beautiful piece for adults!

The font of the letter is the perfect style that complements any outfit beautifully. This Besteel necklace is casual enough for everyday, and elegant enough for your special occasions!

I really bought it for my sister, but I'd keep it for myself if the initial weren't wrong :(

At this price, though, maybe I'll buy one for myself too. And my mom. It truly is a beautiful piece!

This Besteel Initial Necklace sure is a beauty! And trust me, for this price you won't get anything as strong or real-looking as this one! Try and see for yourself!"
"I actually haven't worn them ""out"" yet, but they fit beautifully, tlook great on my feet, and they are very comfortable.  A very neat looking shoe."
my husband finds these jeans comfortable for work  he wears 32 x 32 in silver jeans but levis he wears 33 x 32
"Nice Shirt, fit as expected"
Very cute and my granddaugher liked it too!
This is the only brand of running shoes I buy and I love them! Exactly what I wanted and great price.
These shoes are extremely comfortable. The fact that they are also really cute is a bonus!
"I love these spanx! They are lightweight, so they smooth things down without feeling like I have on compression bike shorts. They are perfect for removing panty lines under a slinky skirt or dress. They provide light shaping while remaining very comfortable."
Wow so comfortable with great support. Good arch and well padded. Love this slip on. I think I will love Earth origins for my next shoe needs
"This is a nice, thin sock that will not slip down your ankle.  There is no cushioning, but they serve their function well."
I loved these shoes but had to return because they were a bit small.  They are soo cute.
I bought this for my boyfriend of 3 years and he loves it had it for almost a year now and its just really good quality and no scratches still looks brand new and its perfect!
"I bought this for my daughter for dance class.  It has a lot of space even for extra tutus, the side pockets fit a large water bottle and dance shoes, and the front has a large zipper pocket.  The colors are nice, the bag seems durable and it was a good price on Amazon."
"Was pleasantly surprised when I received the pendants, what a great price for such quality.  Would definitely recommend.  They're the perfect size, not too large and not too small.  Very detailed, and the crystals are very pretty.  My only complaint would be that I did not receive the chain that was supposed to come with it.  That's the only reason I gave it four stars."
Helped save a friends boots
"So soft, love these raglans!"
Like it work just find
"It's his favorite shirt. My son wears 3t/4t so it's a little big but he can still wear it without it looking too big. Thor is his favorite and the cape makes this shirt so much more fun to wear, especially on windy days. The cape is velcroed to the shoulders for easy removal/attaching. It has held the cape secure even along the gusty beach line."
"I fell in love with the color of these boots on sight. When my order arrived I ordered a second pair for my sister.
I'm considering a black pair ."
"Excellent fit, hugs your foot tightly but not overly-so. Well made, great colors."
patty clothes are always nice I have never been disappointed
A bit tight but fairly good comfort need lots of break in time making small toes raw but a good shoe over all
Gryffindor sucks!
"This sweater fits me just as you see it on the model.  I am 5'3"" tall, so if you are taller, it will obviously be a shorter fit for you.  It is roomy enough without being bulky - I am a bit bulky myself around the mid section, and it fits me nicely.  I happen to like 3/4 sleeves because I can bathe a baby or do the dishes without having to constantly pull up my sleeves.  I have washed it twice and it washes and dries (in the dryer on low) beautifully - not a wrinkle and no shrinkage at all.  The collar is a tiny bit wonky - does not want to lay flat - but it does not bother me."
"Ok guys, I work for a security company that is strict on appearance standards.  So, shirt stays are standard issue when you first start.  But the standard issues were always falling or irritating me in some way shape or form.  But this product from Hero's Pride are OUTSTANDING!!  The clips are strong, they keep your shirt in place, I have NEVER once had a clip come loose.  I have been wearing these for about 6 months now and they are the best addition to a uniform one could ask for.  I have ran, jumped, and jogged in these and they stay put.

One piece of advice guys, when you attach them to your socks / shirt, make sure the smooth clip portion is the side making contact with your skin.  The small circle should turned away from the skin.  You will know what I mean when you see them in person."
"Great leggings. I bought the black. They are nicely soft and stretchy, as well as slightly darker / less sheer on the back side, which will enable me to wear these as pants during night shows, events, etc... I'm 5'2, 110 lbs and they fit decent - a little long on bottom, which is not a problem for me, and high on top, which I will prob roll down (it's not noticeable under a shirt that covers the area), but it can be easily be left up. I would recommend and will be looking into other colors. They are sexy."
Absolutely adorable little charm. I purchased this for a thumb ring of mine. Unfortunately it came off in one day so I did not close the ring tight enough. I will purchase another if I cannot find this one. Efy was very kind and replied immediately to a situation I had when ordering .
These shoes fit perfectly and are the cutest! The wedge isn't that high which is great and the seller even put a cute hand written thank you on the inside :) super impressed
"This is a very nice and attractive belt I will be able to use in the plant to prevent accidentally scratching new vehicles.  However, I recently purchased a ratchet belt.  I love that belt because it ratchets in 1/4 inch increments.  I hope Carhartt makes a scratch free ratchet belt in the near future."
I like it because it does stretch when u wash but I feel it's somewhat small
be aware leg long is (very long) otherwise is a great product
WAS A GIFT AND PERSON LIKED THEM...
perfrect for the summer!
Bought this for my trip to Punta Cana.  It was light in the hot weather and fashionable.
"This was a present for my friend, and she loves it. Nice design and material. Good price."
My daughter loves these shoes.  They were comfy out of the box and look good with everything.  She wears them every day and hasn't complained once.  The best part is that they are super durable and can get wet without a problem.  Believe the positive reviews and order these shoes!
"This attractive watch is elegant and understated.  It is comfortable to wear and easy to read.  I enjoy wearing it to public events as an accessory as well as a timekeeper.  For the last ten years I have used my cellular telephone as a timepiece.  However, I usually turn it off when I am in a meeting.  Unless there was a clock on the wall I could not keep track of time.  Now I am happy to wear this watch to meetings so I can keep up with the time and keep my cellular telephone off.  I like the freedom of having turned off my cell phone so I can keep my focus on the people I am with instead of random telephone calls and text messages."
"Material feels great, just a little too big. I normally wear a medium in scrubs, but I might try a small in this style."
"I love wearing Asics period! Love the colors but aren't as bright as picture but still pretty. Fits is as always with asics, they run small. I wear a 7.5 in others but ASICS it's a 8.5 Highly recommend ASICS for everyone."
The quality of the shirt is MUCH better than I expected. Better than most Halloween costumes I have seen!
Really nice looking ring.  Feels nice as well
"I wanted socks that resisted odor and allowed a good fit on a pair of shoes that are a bit tight (small).
  I knocked a star because they shrunk in the drier. While they still fit fine, they are a bit of a challenge to get on now and I can't tell them apart from my wife's socks when sorting the laundry."
I love this top. I'm ordering more colors.
Great House shoes.
Too cute! I used this for my daughters newborn pictures. It is absolutely adorable
"Quality material is not see through and seams are straight and sewn well. Dark, true black color. Low-regular V neck. Length is perfect for my long torso. Slim fit hugs body. Not loose at all. I normally wear a large and this extra large is fitted."
I am a large and bought the 3xl fit perfectly and love it!! have had for over 2 years no w
I purchased this for Halloween and it was delivered right on time.  It fit perfectly as ordered but was VERY wrinkled when I opened the package. Glad I didn't wait til the last minute. I got a lot of compliments on the costume and it did not feel cheap. I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase.
I really like these khaki's but they do fit a little snug in the crotch. As a man I really don't like that feel but they good khaki's.
I have 3 pairs and wear them for everything except formal occasions.  I am starting run again after a 15 year break and they provide the cushioning and stability that my old body requires.
"I like the Crocs with a wedge angle because of my arch problem.  I like to change styles of shoes, but they are all Crocs.  After wearing Crocs it's hard for me to wear any other shoes.  they are so comfortable."
"I wore this sandal last summer, and was so happy to find a new pair for this summer!  love it!"
Great boots and they fit great!
My child is addicted to these boots.  He wears them everywhere with everything.  He's 3.
These are my favorite everyday jeans for work and casual wear. Perfect fit for me.
"I like these shoes, I don't really wear formal clothes but these shoes add lots of classiness to smart casual clothes.
I can see why some people might think the shoe looks too long, I wear a size 8 so an extra bit of length just adds to the design appeal, but if you're a size 13, forget it, you'd look like you have size 15 shoes on!!"
grandson loved
Very  but zipper was broken. Would buy again tho
"I am 5'3 plus size. We 2XL normal clothes,  I rock these, butt lift, not so much at least for me.  But they are super cute."
When I need a cotton blouse I will re order it is probally great in colors also.  The fabric is great the fit is close to the body if that is what you want and to tuck in that is what I wanted.  Fit is true to size.
"I really like this bag, its big and made with high quality materials! plus it is at a good price. when i received the bag it was bigger than i expected but i ended up really enjoying the amount of space it has, i can really shove alot of s*** in it! And it looks really good and i get compliments on it!"
"Love, love, love this dress from Mordenmiss. Great fit. Stylish and cute. Can wear to work or out for a day on the town. I agree with a previous reviewer that they should make this in additional colors like orange or red. I would buy this again in additional colors!"
Very elegant but yet sturdy. Love the color.
A great pant that allows for waist expansion.
Love these shoes! Buy a pair every summer!
Look good thanks!
Beautiful dress. Fit just as I thought! Love the colors and my daughter loves it too. Would recommend for sure.
This shirt causes the best kind of confusion and starts conversation. Glad I went up in my size.
"These shoes are exactly what I expected. Color, style, fit, etc. The heel has just a tiny bit of lift that is enough to keep your pants hem off the ground, but they are still very comfortable.  Also the rounded toe and bow are not childish, just feminine. The fabric is suede like (not leather) and quality material."
"My wife needed a cheap pair of boots to use while working with dogs at our local animal shelter. She bought these but loves them so much that she wants to buy more for personal use. They look great and fit comfortably. We paid $10 (TEN DOLLARS!!!) so you're obviously not getting Dr. Scholl's comfort or Timberland quality. They seem a little thin and I doubt they will last forever, but she wasn't looking for a pair to invest in. These boots are exactly what she was looking for."
I bought this for a trip to Europe. I have tried it and it is very comfortable.
"I have flat feet.  I wear a womens size 10 and I am a nurse. I have always purchased Puma,  Nike,  Adidas for work,  but due to the long standing they start out comfortable but they don't stay comfortable. I saw the Salomon sneakers and decided to purchase them.... Well, it was like hitting the jackpot.  I can work 12hrs.  and my feet NEVER hurt.  I didn't know hiking sneakers would have made such a positive difference for me.  If I had known I would've purchased these a long time ago.  Thank you salomon for making such a comfortable sneaker for us nurses with flat feet."
Thanks. It's perfect for me.
I really like the boots but my foot is quite narrow and it slips back and forth somewhat.  I wish they fit my foot all the way around better but overall I really like them and would recommend them to others.
"very cute, previously got a navy blue dress with that gold beltband and grandgirl loves both dresses."
"This item fit me very well. I was worried it wouldn't because I was ordering it to come the day before we left for a beach vacation and I wouldn't have time to send it back, but it fit fine.

The only minor problem I had with it was that it rode a little lower than I expected on my hips, but that could be because I'm pregnant and have a big baby bump. Fortunately, the top I bought to go with it had great coverage."
Great. Perfect amount of poof.
Just one word- WOW
"Fantastic Rain Pants! For the price, you can't beat it! I have a tall 4 year old, I bought a 5t and there long enough to wear all year long and hopyfully next year too! I would buy again. Keeps my kid dry as a bone."
The Shoe is to tight over the Span  It puts to much pressure over the top of my Foot
"Nice color..lots of glitz. Would look nice paired with a black leather pant.or a blazer/suit coat or jean jacket with white pants..
It has a little give, I have had shirts in the past with sequin that didn't budge. Go by the size chart, I did and it fits perfect."
"These were a little large, especially in the length of leg, but my husband who has always taken ""large"" actually may be ready to move into ""medium"".  I expected the legs to shrink, but not so far after two washings."
I'm a female and ordered this in and xs. Typically issue with unisex tops; it's box in the shoulder and a little tight around the hips. I think a small would have been to baggy all around so I kept the xs. I work in peds and the boys LOVE this top. Very bright colors and fun. I wish they had this material in a girl fit.
"I am 5'8""and weight 161.  Measurements are 44-36-38.  I ordered a 12-14..  It is a touch big, but I like that.  It is an attractive suit and I like the way it looks on me."
i have bought this a time before and love them. the rest of my cooks always complain about the heat but i feel fine granted i don't wear an undershirt like you are suppose with a chef coat but if you work in a not open kitchen and are in a tight place this is the coat you need i now own 10 cuz my first 5 wore out or got bleach stained.
Beautiful. Not bad for the money.
The cuteness is killing me. This was perfect for pictures for my daughter. I love it.
Only issue is the band
"So comfortable you barely notice they are on your feet, these are my favorite shoes."
These are comfortable shoes for at home or out and about
"Runs large but it will probably last for next year as well.
Definitely will do the job outside while playing in the snow but not for too long because the material will eventually get wet.
As others mention the fleece inside is only in the hoodie and the torso area.
My son was running while wearing it and seem comfortable.
Quality seems great, like all the Columbia items."
very cute can be dressed up or down
Pretty and well made with a wonderful note inside. Packaged very nicely and shipping was fast. Will definetly consider ordering from this seller again. Thank You. :)
"good cute sensible shoes, unfortunately just a little too small/shallow for my feet which tend to swell."
These are adorable and soft! They shipped as expected.
I like this bag.  Adjustable shoulder strap is great for the right length.  Holds a lot for a small wallet.
"Used this for Aerosole sneaks  that were too tight  and I couldn't wear them for long  to  even break them in.
NOW  they are comfortable!  If you try it for sneaks....  do not  over stretch them.  :)"
"I am super cheap and had a hard time paying $20 for flip flops but these shoes have lasted me two years plus one music festival. I've logged many miles in them and am completely satisfied. They're very comfortable too, providing support that most sandals don't. Very pleased!"
"Fits great, excellent coverage!"
Beautiful green color! I hesitated to buy because of other reviews. I have had no issues walking in these very comfortable sandals!
Had mine for months not a single rip or discoloration I wear them everyday
Perfect and very comfortable and husband is very happy
"I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE COMFORTEBLE, THERE ARE NO AMAZING, COMMON SANDALS."
it was very wrinkled and even after pressing still had some especially around the collar
Perfect for keeping the kiddo's legs and feet warmer. She loves to take off her shoes and socks and wearing these at least keeps her feet covered! Would buy again.
perfect for my cosplay! fit well and perfect purple on the sleeves. not washed out or too dark.
Very happy with these shoes.  Plan to order another pair in a different color since I like them so much.  The size 8 is a 38.5 in european size.  I usually wear 38 but for these I needed the 38.5 because I like to wear thick socks.
Several size options and they look great!
"I'm 5' 4"", wear a 32DD, and weigh approximately 127 lbs. I usually wear a small/medium in tops.  I ordered a small and it fits well everywhere.  It looks good with or without a belt and can be worn with leggings or alone.  I am happy with my purchase so far."
Just the arms and shoulders are small rest of coat has plenty of room  Not good for any women out there with a little muscle in their biceps
"Many Compliments on this scarf.  Got two for
some reason.  Thought I had ordered a different color
and up comes another one same color.  Guess I will
give it to my daughter."
These earing are absolutely beautiful!!! I can't believe the prize for the quality. I highly recommend these product for yourself or for someone special.
"These slick shoes are quite lightweight.  Size 10 is just under 8.5oz each.  The neon green gives them some flash without being over-the-top gaudy.  They are Made in Cambodia.  I have to say that there is not a lot of cushion in these cleats.  Inside is hard. . . Not much padding around the ankle either.  Perhaps cut corners on comfort to make the lightweight.  The cost is based upon the size you select.  At the current pricing. . . if you can get your required size on the lower-end of the scale, then they are not bad.  But Id never pay the upper-end, which is currently over a hundred bucks."
"I bought this as a replacement for my 20+ year bath robe.
This is very good quality ad fits well although its longer than the one it replaces I got used to it.
VERY NICE!"
"I have 2 of the skirts. Lightweight, comfortable, and a good length.  I do recommend."
These are excellent. Not too dark or too light. They easily fit over my regular glasses and are very comfortable. Excellent quality and good price! My eyes feel much better! They are actually the second pair I've bought. One to keep at work and one at home!
"I'm 5'4 120lbs normally wear a small/medium after reading all the reviews I purchased the large. They weren't lying when they said these are tight. Definitely get 2 sizes bigger than your actual size. This did work as a slip but it didn't really flatten the mommy pooch. Looks the same with it on and off (in my preference). But I bought it more for an under slip. Gotta wiggle a little to get it on lol but it does fit perfect, doesn't ride up and comfortable.  Only complaint I have is not a fan of the underwear. Other than that its a great buy for price and produce."
Really comfortable and excellent fit but belt loops only in the back and fake front pockets are ridiculous.
"Very nice boots, fit perfectly and looked amazing im thinking of getting another pair in a different color i love them.."
True to size and really cute.
"They're a little short, but they fit pretty much the way I expected."
This is the best skirt ever.  Beautiful worked great for my vacation.  I felt like a Disney princess at the Disney resort!!
The wallet looks very sturdy and well made.  I was surprised that the back panel was black!  Not thrilled with the look of that but I'm sure it is to help it slide into his pocket easier
"This is super cute!  And it fits perfectly.  I am a size 6 bottom and 34c/36b top and this fits beautifully, I purchased the 4-6.  I really like the fit, look  and feel of the top, I can wear  it with a few of my different bottoms.

I received this at a discount for my honest review."
"These shoes are a fun pop of color, fit just right, and are pretty comfortable to wear around."
This bag is the perfect size bag for the lockers at my gym and I love the wet pocket. Love the look and the quality of the bag is very high. It looks very durable and I am enjoying using it.
attractive and light weight to wear but color lighter green than I expected
"If you are looking at these, you are a smart person, anticipating problems to ensure unfortunate circumstances don't befall you.  I won't post pictures.  Many reviewers have already done that.

What is important about this product?

Comfort?

It is not perfect, but you know it's there.  One side with the zippers needs face out for convenience and comfort.  I also tried it the other way, to present a lower profile--it was tolerable but too hard to reach things. I wore in on my belly mostly cocked to my left side, normal side out.

Stealthy?

If you want stealth--this will give it. Keep you valuables where they can't be taken easily.  This won't prevent you from getting ripped off by a swarm of gypsy children--they are too smart for that.  I've seen that happen.  A dozen or more kids hitting the richest looking man, pinning him down, and taking everything, jewelry, watches, wallets, passports, cash.  This won't protect you from that unless perhaps you have several layers.  For most situations, however, it provides an excellent level of protection.

Size?

Size is perfect, IMHO.  The inner pocket will hold passports--which is my biggest fear to lose when traveling overseas.  Be sure to photo copy your passport, just in case, and store it elsewhere.  There is enough space to store a small pocket pistol and some padding to smooth out the bulge.  The belt can be pushed to one side so it doesn't make your belly look too big.  I placed it cocked on my left side and was easily able to open a buttoned shirt to reach in and grab passports, a money clip, and a small gun with my dominate right hand.  It was not noticable when I wore a loose fitting T-shirt or polo shirt on top.  I chose dark colors for the shirts.  As long as it is not too hot out, I think it would work well.

Features?

Several pockets with convenient sizes, adjustable strap.  Zippers for security.  Everything you could want.

This is my second money belt.  The other one is slimmer and useful only for cash or credit cards.  I tossed it out.  This is much better."
Usually wear a 12 but had to go to 13's in these and they fit like I expected a 12 to fit!
Beautiful dress! It's versatile can be worn as a dress or a shirt. It's sooooo worth the price. FYI: it looks just like the picture
"Very pretty color and pattern. Got los of compliments at a summer wedding. Flattering cut for bigger sizes. Dress hd some small discolorations, but not too noticeable. Also a bit big on top, so will have to have it taken in a smidge."
I liked the fit and the quality of the material.  Will order again
"Cute,cute.."
My granddaughter is 15 months old and LOVES these shoes because they squeak with every step.  And her momma knows exactly where she is.  When the shoes stop squeakingtime to go see what she is doing!
"I love this dress, comfortable and flows beautifully."
Really like the double snappy compartments. Works well for my needs. The two sides fold up and are held with magnets; I use this for holding receipts until I get them home. Be sure you read the measurements of this wallet; if you carry a small purse be sure it will fit inside before ordering. Very happy with this item.
"Good fit. Good price. Fabric is a little thinner than I'd expected, so not quite as warm, but they'll be fine for springtime lounge and sleep use."
"I normally wear an xl but I ordered a large based on the size chart and the description which says ""OUR SIZES RUN A BIT LARGE."" It is a bit too small. This shirt was exactly what I was looking for, so I am very annoyed because the xl was available at the the time of my purchase, but now it is not. I ordered 2 in different colors and they are both too small. They are cut like men's shirts, broad at the shoulders and narrow at the hem. I am not built like a man, but I would still order more of these in my usual size if the colors I like were not sold out. The fabric is nice, not too thin or sheer. It drapes well, so it would be ok if the shoulders are a bit too wide. I also love the length. So many women's tops are too long these days and curvy women do not look good in long tops."
Arrived on time - and shoes fit to size
Very nice and good shirt
brim larger then expected
It is a very nice Yoga short for the price and it fits as expected.
"Love this shirt, fits perfectly and it's very comfortable and warm."
Now I can throw away my old long pants that were dragging on the ground!  The Walmart in my city won't order my size so  Im glad that amazon can order them for me. Thanks amazon and shame on you walmart for not giving the customers what they want and need. Walmart sells these pants but not petite short.
"This is my third pair of the Gel-Blur 33. There is a slight different between the cross trainer (this one) and the running shoe, but both have been fantastic. The TR seems to have a little more room in the toe box--nice feature. But the running shoe has the PHF (perfect heel fit) which I like very much and is missing in the TR. I have plantar issues and have a difficult time finding shoes with enough support. I've had the running shoe twice and now the trainer and both have met my needs. I am really hard on my athletic shoes. These stand up pretty well. And they are good looking!"
I am very pleased about this item :) I would definitely would order again!! It's exactly what you see in the picture. It's true to its size. Even thought I wanted to make sure it fit me I ordered a size up. And I'm glad I did!! :D it's perfectly :) I'm a somewhat big girl but it fits my cafes awesomely. I'm a size 8 and a half and ordered a size 9 (m). Fits nice!! And shipping was extremely fast! I got the free shipping buy it came in within a week! Love it.
Very durable and good size. Great buy.
beautiful fits great great price my daughter likes little rings she picked this for her birthday loves it wares everyday with my problems thanks amazon great ring
Beautiful and helps when it's at a great price.
I am replacing a similar brand so I thought I knew my size - these run a bit big.
"Great product. Very light and comfortable. Not too short or too girly. Good for women of different ages. The sizing is accurate. This is a US type S-size, not chinese S-size."
"Well made, the right size for my needs, and it's good looking.  I really like the fact there is a small handle on top, briefcase like, along with the longer straps."
"Really like these,, look so good, and the pearls look great. Great buy too.."
"My son loves these shoes.  I try to take them off after wearing them all day and he gets mad and tries to put them back on.  They also have a great grip on the floor and he never slides even on wet ground or smooth cement (loves to run around in Lowe's).

Edit: my son loved these so much after many months of use that we bought them in the next size up. He demands to wear these shoes all the time. Great toddler shoes!"
"Very cute shoes and they will work wonderfully for walking around Key West!  Very comfortable.  Easy on and off.  I typically wear a 6.5, sometimes a 7.  I read the reviews and ordered a 6.5.  My toe just reaches the top of the shoe.  I probably could have gone with a 7...  My foot tends to be a little wide (I don't wear wide width though) and I had no problem getting them on."
I LOVE THIS DRESS I GOT A SMALL (which I usually wear) IT FITS PERFECT LIKE A GLOVE BUT STRETCHES TO MOVE FREELY AHHHH IM SO HAPPY !!!!!!!
comfortable...nice fit
"Fit was good, exactly as shown."
I ordered these for my family for our Ireland. My teens did not like to keep up with them but my husband used his to keep us all organized. Perfect for travel!
like it comfy
"Perfect! Fits great, looks amazing and they are very comfortable"
I was impressed with the quality of this duffle bag.  The woodland camo design looks sharp and the straps look durable since it is not made out of the leather which many reviewers have complained about.  I would recommend this bag.
A tad bit snug but looks amazing and the craftsmanship is impeccable.
Very pretty was a little small but stI'll worked very well.
It's gorgeous and worth the money! The stones are all even and so beautiful
Good fit and delivery.
The top was a bit large for me but still wearable and really cute. I'm only a c cup so I'm sure it would be perfect for larger breasts. The bottom however is fantastic it makes it easy to match any top with it. The mesh skirt was too long for my preference so I cut it to above the knee and it worked well.
The necklace was perfect ... my problem was it was a lot heavier (thicker) than I expected.  I ordered it to use with a heavy pendant and it was too thick ... BUT it looks great as a heavy chain.  It is well finished with no rough spots.  I'm enjoying wearing it with a bulky sweater.
"UPDATE:
I got a pair of these in December, black ones too. Loved & wore them for 2-3 months. One toe of the charcoal boots, my favorites, was defective, sort of caved in. I was so bummed. It was too late for a return so I figured that was that. Later in April I sent a note & photo of the defect, got a nice note back to return the defective pair (no charge) which were replaced with a new pair. I am happy again:)

Very disappointed. I ordered these in black (one size up) and brown (1/2 size up) since normally when I get boots I need a bigger size as I have a high instep.  I really wanted the black ones to go with an outfit and my winter coat but the brown/charcoal ones intrigued me as the color was unusual.  The brown/charcoal ones got here first and fit well (even a little loose) and were comfortable from the moment I put them on so I decided to keep them.  I liked them so much that when the black ones came I exchanged them for the smaller size and kept those too.  Unfortunately, after a few weeks, the brown/charcoal showed a major defect BUT it was too late for me to return them.  I really loved them, even more than the black ones, but now I hate to wear them anywhere since they really look dumb with left one all deformed at the toe.
Photo of boots with messed up toe here:
[...]since they won't post the link to my photo I can't show you how awful they look unless you can find it by leaving out the spaces in the links below:
[...]
No reason for it either as they were never worn more than once or twice a week, if that.
Hope the black ones don't do the same thing, they are worn even less."
light and thin
"These could not be more comfortable.  Even the first time I put them on, they were not stiff at all. The inside of the canvas that sits on top of your foot feels great and has nice stretch.  I definitely recommend these and plan to get them in more colors!"
"My son loves these, they seem to fit really well and be comfortable."
This little hippe purse is adorable . It exactly as described.
These are great shoes; love the style and look but too wide and have to wear socks all the time with them.  I have a normal (not wide nor narrow) feet and found these shoes appear to be made for wide feet.
"I will not hesitate to make future purchases from PACIFIC LEGEND FLORAL. I love Hawaiian shirts which I've purchase several every year I've gone back to that Islands for the last 30 years. Unable to continue my travels as my age and health are out of my control I buy these shirts with a great big grin. I've seen similar shirts for 3 times the price at ALA MOANA SHOPPING MALL.
."
"Really comfortable, soft fabric."
"Son loves them, I would get the next size they shrink in the wash."
I purchased these for my son who wears them as shoes.  He says they are very comfortable and the sole is sturdy enough for outdoors.
"Great shoes, light as a feather. Does everything they need to do."
"love it! the only thing is, it is very thin and easy to see through in the back."
I jus liked them
"Soft, comfortable cover up bra. Not much support yet I had left mastectomy with starting of reconstruction and I find it great to wear with the padding on my right for lift. Pretty and comfortable"
"This hat works perfectly for me out in the sun working in the yard. The bungee cord allowed me to adjust the hat size so that it fit snugly. The brim is wide enough to keep the sun off my neck and face and the mesh keeps the air circulating. It seems to be well made and I like the orange color which I believe is more of a rust. Since I am a female, the size works well. A large man might find the top to be somewhat shallow. Very nice sun hat at a great price!"
I get lots of compliments on this s***. Doesn't quite cover all my junk in the trunk but that ok.  The only problem is that it pills up when you wash it.
These keep my feet warmer than any other slipper.  The pair I received were damaged and the seller gave me full credit on them.  The lining was unsewn or torn and I couldn't get my foot in.  After some trying I managed to turn them partly inside out and sew the lining by hand.  I really like these.
These shoes are so pretty and fun. I even wear them with casual sun dresses. I do recommend sizing up 1/2 size. I wear a 7 and purchased 7.5 and they fit well. The rhinestones are a very pretty design.
"A nice size and many comparments to fill, well made"
Love it and the lovely packaging.
Used these for a dance recital and they were perfect. Flexible and comfortable. My only complaint was that they wouldn't allow me to slide on the stage like I needed to but hey that's what you want in everyday shows right?
"nice fitting shorts, will be ordering more....."
"Love the dress. Has a very unique bow belt. It fit a bit close for my extra tall 8 year old. I ordered a 14, which is her size."
"Mostly comfortable fit, pockets are a reasonable size for hands, and objects such as a phone remain in the pocket. Only dropped one star due to the fabric stretches out quickly after each wash and pants become baggy. Not a problem if you don't mind a little extra room."
The shoe was everything I expected.  It was to small.  Will consider getting it in another size.
I love this T.  I wish they came in a pack of three like men's t-shirts do.  I haven't washed it yet but when I do I plan on just tumble drying because I don't want it to shrink.
The fit is perfect for my arms.  I have been diagnosed with melanoma.  So this product is used every time I'm outside.  It kept its form and size even after washing.  Very good product.
This is great! It fits great and is awesome for my kayaking adventures. Highly recommend.
I love these jeans!  These were my first pair of true religions and i have a coke bottle figure so i wasn't sure they would fit but they did!!  i have since tried two other styles the joey and the billy but the becky fits best if you have curves.  also all of the true religions need to be hemed unless you are 7 feet tall so there's that too.  but i love this becky style i wear them more then any other jeans i have!
Nice comfortable nightgown.  Fits well
I have bought several pairs of the chaco sandals. This is my favorite style. The soles have good support and the straps keep my foot in place. The straps do not rub at all. I wear a size 12b so it's hard to find decent sandals in my size. These sandals last a long time and are easy to clean if you get them dirty.
These are so comfortable and look great. I am 5'1 and they are like regular pants on me. I weigh 135 and a 6 fits.
"LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE BOOTS! I  have wide calves and honestly didn't expect these to go above the knee. They do, even over skinny jeans! I  also have wide feet, and they don't pinch or squeeze.  The sole is a nice thickness. They shipped quickly.  There is a smell, but I expect that from new boots. I will recommend these to friends."
Love this dress! Lots of compliments on it.
"Its a tadhit snug around the midsection, so get about one size bigger than you normally would."
As described. Looks quality.
"I ordered Blake, Camila and Logan. I'm in between a size 9 and a size 11, 9 is usually a bit too tight around the waist for me, so I went with 11. They fit pretty well. Maybe a tad loose, but nothing a belt can't fix. They look nice on. The legs are a little long for me. I got the normal size but i should have ordered short. I'm 5'3"" and 150 lbs."
"Love these, but they are not a dark hunter green like in the photos, they are a kindof bright, medium tone kelly green. Adorable & well-made!"
I love Skechers... what can i say?!  It's like walking around in your slippers all day long!  This style definitely runs very wide but i think it's part of the design.  I put inserts in mine to take up some space & they are more comfortable (i have a narrow foot).  The good news is that you can wear an extra heavy sock with them (they aren't made to be worn in very cold temperatures) & still be cozy. They are structured well.  I'm going to order the black too!
Glitter gets everywhere and they squeak a ton at first but they're so cute.
"The skirt in the picture appeared somewhat appropriate in length.  I ordered a medium because Im a 4-6, and it was way too tight in the butt area and was obscenely short such that I had to put a skirt on over the costumes skirt to go out in public.  I posted pics with and without a skirt over it.  Also, even the costume was a medium, the calf things they sent me were XS, and fitting my calves into them was trying to squeeze sausages into packaging, and one of then ripped!"
My daughter loves it and wears it often!
Great Price ! I really like that they have six of them .
3rd pr for family member.  Actually requested by a female member of my family.  Was pleased @ XMas when she opened pkg.
"cute, wish it were metal but for the price it worked out well"
I love Cherokee brand especially the core stretch they are very true to size
"Great cologne. Long lasting. Smells great, like a quality cologne. Clean, fresh, classy, and masculine."
I had these in a 9.5 pre-pregnancy.  Then they were snug but I loved them.  Very stylish and comfy.  Post pregnancy I'm a size 10 and ordered a new pair but they were too snug so I had to send them back.  :(
Beautiful but I would suggest to go up half a size or a full size due to the plastic material on the typical rain boots. Very stylish ans have a zipper. 
Print shows well on both sides...Easy to wrap around my body and tie/knot. Love it!
"I do not wear anything beside flipflops all summer long (beside when my wife and work make me) at first the heal seemed a bit high from the air bubble, they just needed to be broken in, took a day and a half.

I have yet to use the bottle openers in the soles.
I picked mine up for $35 with free shipping, the typically go for $50, I'm a bit tight with a buck but I may splurge for the $50 if I can get a full year or two out of these"
I received these sunglasses yesterday and gave them to my husband. The look fabulous on him and he says the view is very clear and great on a sunny day. I am very pleased with this purchase. Thank you
"Absolutely love this, can't wait for my grand daughter to open this at Christmas"
Great value - very stylish . Fifteen More Words Required. Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler Filler
"The fabric is what I expected.  It is not too thick or too thin.  The long sleaves are somewhat tight but still fit, the rest of the set fits fine.  I wanted both lite and heavy for use in air condition or not. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone.  This can transition from spring to summer and then to fall."
"Pretty cute slippers.  These fit just right (I wear 8 or 8 1/2 and bought the size 7-8 in these) and have a soft cushy insole and a rubber sole so if you have to go outside, your feet won't get wet and you shouldn't ruin your slippers.  My only complaint is that the vamp is pretty short so the slipper doesn't come up on your foot very high and unless you're paying attention, you might walk out of one.  I've just had them one weekend and am already used to them.  Just know that if someone's chasing you, these aren't the shoes you want to be wearing."
Beautiful casual dress. Definitely order a size up.
"Fit perfectly. A little long in the legs and I'm 5'8"", but I like that. Otherwise no problems so far."
The shoes fit as well and comfortable.
"Shoes are beautiful. Could not believe the price. It's hard to find narrow width.  Will remember the company.  Will welcome e-mails for other shoes, purses etc."
Very beautiful  arrived  in the mail very fast I have gotten  a lot of compliments about  this necklace  very well made
Good looking shoe. More of champagne color than gold. Wish the leather was a bit softer like the snake skin/taupe ones but overall good shoe!
This too! I sometimes borrow it from my 2 year old!
"My 2nd pair from the company, both need some breaking in but great support for all day on my feet."
Love the robe...just wish they were on Prime....
"Vivid colors, my 5 yrs old love them!"
"Lindsey's switch flops are always classy, you  change from straps to make them sassy. It only takes a couple soles to get you started for vacation."
These are very nice and work wonderfully! Very true to size!
"I usually buy Eagle Creek gear, but their prices seemed high. I was pleasantly surprised, especially for the low price. The quality was the same as Eagle Creek, but these had labels on the cap support you could rotate to the one you want - makes it easy to differentiate shampoo from lotion. They also have a nice feature of a suction cup to stick to a tub wall, although I haven't done so yet. They sealed and performed well for a couple of flights, including one overseas. I would buy them again."
"I was not sure what to expect when I opened the package-it looks like it is inside out and a somewhat of a torture device.  It is any but a torture device.  I love the straps, I wish more bras had the adjustable-stay put straps secured with hooks(much like the back of a bathing suit-just on the straps. I have used this bra for two rigorous bike classes and 3 days of crazy cardio. This lifts and separates perfectly.  I will wear this for more than workouts. It is hard to get the support I need without looking squished. I just ordered it in black."
"she is a teacher and stands all day, super nice looking and comfy!!
she loved them. will look for more good deals on Clarks."
My husband wore this for halloween and it looked good on him. Looked much more realistic than those cheap fuzzy ones.
Happy gal:)
I love these little shoes and so does my daughter!!!  She walks great in them.
Great little shoe for the price. Holds up to toddlers and mud puddles well.
"Love these shoes but they are too small. I usually wear a 7 or 7.5 US and ordered these 7.5, but I have to re-order size 8. Never wore that size before. But otherwise these are very cool shoes and I think they will be comfortable when they fit.
One week later...Size 8 arrived. Fits perfectly, very comfortable right out of the box. Great shoes, just buy 'em big."
"I like these slippers, they are comfy and warm.  Only with they had half sizes, I got the 9 and they were too tight and I wasn't sure if they would stretch out enough, the 10 fits but is a little big."
"This is so sexy ,elegant, soft form fitting fits perfect, can't say enough good. 5'5"", 36A"
Comfortable shirt and bright kelly green.
"Very pretty,love this top"
"I highly recommend these boots. Well made, very comfortable and warm. Sturdy but cute."
"The is a beautiful purse and a great size for everyday use. The shape is square and reminds me of a bit of a briefcase and looked very business like. I returned it and ordered the Hobo Kensie from amazon, it has a bit more slouch casual look.

Pros:
Beautiful Leather
Adjustable strap
Practical pockets and space
Deep enough to use have a wallet and a change of clothes for my potty training toddler.

Cons:
Too square and businesslike for my style"
"Love the chain, thick and strong chain. I please with my purchase."
The bag arrived promptly and is even lovelier than I expected.  This is a beautiful bag and will go with practically everything.
Great pants for working and sweating. Light weight material doesn't soak up sweat and get heavy like some fabrics do. Also indestructible. I wear them for yardwork as well as at the range and they are perfect for both.
"Items came with a string attached to it (see pic) that I had to cut off so it didn't tear the fabric. It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be based on the photos; the photos are a little deceiving I think. Granted, I should have looked more closely at the item description. It will be cute to use on my next newborn photo session though."
I wanted these stacking jewelry organizers for a long time and am thrilled that I finally bit the bullet and ordered them. The containers I used took up a lot of space on my dresser top and were unsightly. Now after clearing a small drawer and using the organizers everything is neat and tucked away from sight. Couldn't be happier.
I am very pleased fits as expected tight so you can or order up or not but happy with fit. Overall very pleased
Love this Sweater !!
Love it. Very versitile. We even used it as a swaddle blanket and  carseat cover  for our newborn
It's my everyday watch I just change the ban
"I frequently change purses depending on my need of the day.  I thought a bag organizer would help me move my essentials over in a more convenient way.  I had selected the red one and received it in a timely manner.  Unfortunately it is way too small for my needs (I am a big bag sort of girl).

PROS:
1: Seems well made with strong zipper and soft padded sides
2: Very lightweight
3: Expandable
4: Has 2 handles
5: 8 side pockets
6: 2 zippered inner pouches
7: Available in many fun colors

CONS:
1: Wish it was available in more sizes

Overall a nice bag organizer that is perfect for smaller purses.  If you are like me and carry bigger bags, this will likely be too small for you.  It is well constructed and very versatile.  I rated it 5 stars because size does not change the fact that this is a well-made product.

DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend."
"I really do like these capris. You definitely need a belt though. I was pulling them up every 4 or 5 steps... Very annoying. I have fairly ""normal"" sized legs. These capris are snug in the legs. They are very stretchy so it isn't a problem for me but if you have larger calves or ""cankles"" these will not work for you."
"Sweater looks just like the picture. Oversized cardigan sweater with elbow length sleeves. Lightweight wool, not super warm but a good fashionable indoor sweater.. Super comfortable, good weekend sweater."
Size smaller than the old
These shorts are awesome. Very comfortable fits just right. I'm a 32w in pants and these are less than half of an inch snug. So... not bad. also the color is just as vibrant as the picture
My man really got a kick when he received this.  It fit him to a T!!
Have many expensive wallets... love this and it fits in smaller bags.
I do love these boots but they run small and I had to go up a size.  They are very comfortable for my daily hikes.  Would buy another pair in this style.
These are the only jeans that I wear.  I love the fit but unfortunately they are impossible to find.  Hope this is not the last time I can purchase them.
"These small earrings are the perfect way to add a little sparkle to your step. Their classic oval shape and colorful crystal makes them elegant but fun, and I received comments on them when I wore them on an afternoon out.
Unfortunately, the weight of each earring continually pulled it out of place in my earlobe, so that the face of the earrings hung down toward my shoulders instead of facing front. Having to continually reach up and re-align my earrings was an annoyance, but I'm not sure if this problem is unique to me or if it's something other wearers are likely to encounter."
Had to buy a second pair because they are stylish and comfortable.
Great looking pair of jeans for my little man. Good price. Fit well. He likes them.
The charm received looks like the one pictured however it doesn't sparkle like the one depicted. The stone placement is the same and it looks nice. Maybe under the right lighting the one I received would have the same brilliance. In any case for the money it still looks great.
I love this! It is long and covers all the way down to my c-section tummy area. I love the 3 rows of hooks so it will tailor down or up as needed. Made very well. Had over a year and work out in it and has held up. Definitely recommend.
Great pants.  I bought this for my bf.  They fit him well and wick away water nicely.  All the pockets are awesome.  These pants seem rather durable and all purpose.
Looks good especially the fitted sleeves.  I've washed it several times without fading or pilling in the material.  Will order again!
"If one of the lenses had not been received dislodged from the frame this item would have received five star rating. They look good, are comfortable and reduce glare extremely well."
"KEEN is my brand.

No pressure points. Did not have to break it in. Lightweight. Great for walking on pavement and the beach."
Fits well and the memory foam foot liner is nice and comforable.  The quality so far seems good and the construction is holding up even after a mistake by the ocean that waterlogged the shoes.
"These are awesome. They make my dress shoes look great and because they flex a little my shoes are now like slip-ons AND it adds to the mobility of the shoe making it more comfortable!

I accidentally installed them backward and I was afraid I would rip them when I tried pulling it back out to reinstall. Very impressed they didn't rip and still retain a great ""grip"" in the holes.

After having them for about 2 months they still are holding up and looking great!"
I bought this as a gift for my friend and he loves it! It fits his head well and makes for a good laugh.
Purchased for my 9 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves them. Very cute and stylish.
"I have settled on the jack black line as I think overall it's superior to billy jealousy- but nothing I've ever tried is better than this shave cream. It does everything they advertise it to do. I have super sensitive skin, and after shaving, no red marks or irritation at all. And it has a very nice clean scent."
"The fabric in these is softer than some other brands without being so thin you can see through. I am very happy with the quality of them, the color choices, and their durability."
"I was looking for a decent, comfortable, quick-drying bra for travel in a hot, humid climate and found this at Target. I've always worn only cotton and hate padded cups. But this is amazing. No padded cups (yay), the fabric is soft, seamless (except for an unobtrusive seam at the top of each shoulder), has wide side/back coverage and actually supports. The label says ""machine wash warm, tumble dry low"" and it air-dried it in 2 hours.
It looked smooth across my torso, the fabric is lightweight, and feels luxurious - not sheer and not plastic-y. I am so pleased that I've bought 4 more.

The size suggested by the tag did surprise me, and since there is a completely useless sizing chart offered, I'll try to relate the one from the tag:
Small: 34A, 34B, 36A
Medium: 34C, 34D, 36B, 36C
Large: 36D, 38B, 38C 38D, 40B
X-Large: 40C, 40D, 42B, 42C,
2X:44B, 44C, 46B, 46C
3X: 48B, 48C, 50B, 50C
((if you're not listed, then the chart does not mention your size).

There are three hook-and-eye fastening widths to choose from, and yes, the straps are not adjustable, but I didn't find that a problem. The fabric is stretchy in multiple directions and keeps a surprisingly good profile for not having any underwire. It looks as good at the end of the day as at the beginning, and let's just say that while I'm not massively endowed, I'm not able to get away with ""decorative"" support.

Please note that I had to find this based on the photo. The label inside says ""G796/HOC7/4587"" but the ""G796"" brings up a different bra on Amazon.

Added Comment 10 August, 2015:
I found the photo to be a bit misleading as to the ""Nude"" colour (which looks too light) and the ""Golden Cocoa"" which looked more like regular nude colour. BUT...in life, the ""Nude"" colour is true to the general colour associated with nude in lingerie, and the ""Golden Cocoa"" is more of a dark caramel/brown (think the dark caramel/brown pantihose BEFORE you stretch them across your skin). And while I'm on it, the ""Navy"" is more blue-black than sapphire blue. Hope this helps."
"Great little dress,."
Love it. Can be read easily. Like the date and the leather strap. The leather is a little stiff when first got it but gets better more you wear it. Will tell everyone about it .
"These are cute, comfy, a bit heavy but most rain boots are. If I go on a long walk I will put my insoles in. These come with fuzzy insoles."
"Overall, I'm pleased with the shoes.  As other reviewers have noted, they do run a little small.  I take an 11 and a twelve would have been a more ""accurate"" fit.  However, I have a very narrow foot, and I think the shorter length helped with my fit.  The laces will have to be replaced soon because they are weak.  All that being said, I was impressed with the quality of the stitching and overall construction.  I would definitely buy again."
"I really like the fabric, it's soft and forgiving. This t-shirt would work really well with shorts, jeans or a skirt. The access for the breastfeeding is pretty good as well. I like that it's not bulky on my belly."
Very cute and because i love the clear  they go with everything.  I get tons of compliments
Must have for kids
Perfect shoes for a nurse. My feet haven't been sore yet! WOW! They have amazing cushion and go wide for my feet! Thank you!!
Ordered a couple of these shirts for my brother's birthday. He said they fit well and are very comfortable. They look good on him also. Good price. He's satisfied.
"The T-shirt is not top of the line for its category, but, for the money it's pretty good."
These seem a bit shorter than they should be.  They'll occasionally ride up a bit and stop covering my inner thighs.
"This wig looked great. A little heavy, make sure to secure it well."
"Very light on my feet, which is important to me. Nice, wide toe box, well made,& even more attractive than photo depicted.
."
My granddaughter loves these so much she wears them everyday they're cute and comfy!
Love this book bag! It works great for going to the library to work on my graduate classes.
Love this item and i wish it came in beige or white. It is very comfortable and there isn't any itchy lace on the edges.
"The cloth is bueatiful and confortable, my wife like it. But it is not very good quality of it's price."
It is perfect! My husbands head in it is priceless! Made well. No shrinkage!
Nice belt but it comes very large. So I have to make more holes. But thankfully it comes with an object to do that.
"Have worn without taking off for a year now and still looks great and has held up for daily showers!  Still looks great and holding up well!
Love it,"
"I actually used this sword as part of my Japanese rave costume, and it was perfect!  I didn't want one of the shorter samuari swords, and this one was the perfect length (around 3 feet from tip to end)."
"I am giving the Jambu boots four stars because once you work out all the kinks, they are really comfortable and that is what a good pair of shoes is all about. The Jambu boots run small, really small! You need to go up one size, or at the very minimum a half size. The inner lining is a separate piece and moves when you try to to put them on and can get crunched up. The calf width is small to medium so if you have really big calves, they will be very tight.  By now you are probably wondering why I gave these four stars, well if you get the right size and get your foot into them, they are like a second skin. The rubber sole is designed to conform to the contours of your foot and it does this really well. I don't even feel like I am wearing shoes much less boots when I have them on. I can wear them all day and be comfortable. I can hike about in them, take long walks with my puppy or just hang around and they are comfortable from when I put them on till I take them off. They look great with pants, tucked in or not, skirts, dresses and leggings. Both the brown and charcoal are neutral colors and work with anything in my wardrobe, except dress up dresses :-)

Pros:  Light weight, comfortable, durable, stylish, able to tuck pants into them, look good with both pants and skirts

Cons: Run small (size up), Separate inner liner, smaller calf width size"
This is a very nice shirt.  Fits nice but just a little smaller than expected but I still like the fit.
"These are truly unique in the world of shoes ,they are works of art. These are scuptures to wear on your feet and they are beautiful. It is really hard to believe they were so affordable as they are haute couture of gellies. They do take getting a little used to,however I don't think I will be wearing them out of doors for a long while as I don't want to damage them in any way. Perfect for an elegant occasion of acultural  or artistic nature .I am as pleased as I have ever been with a pair of flats let alone gellies. You will be surprised how lovely they really are."
"I purchased the size 8 which is my normal size.  The pants fit fine, but the waist band is a little looser than I wanted.  I am a true pear shaped woman so this problem is not unusual.  I do love the jeans though and they are very comfortable.  I may try the size 6 for my next pair."
"This magnetic faux leather case can hold lots of different cards. It's a perfect size for credit cards, gift cards, library cards, RV park cards, players club cards (live in NV), and even business cards. It smells like leather and with the magnetic closure is very secure.

This looks very impressive, has a nice feel to it, and to me looks like ""real"" leather. For someone passing out business cards (like our daughter) this would make a great case to carry them in. For me I use it for all those above mentioned cards and I love the hot pink color.

"This is my second shirt from Trump and as with the first, it is a quality product. The fit is perfect. This is not a Trump Signature shirt but I knew that when I ordered it and didn't really expect the quality of the Signature series of shirt but I was mistaken. I will be ordering more from Trump."
Really comfortable athletic shoes
"Super soft! Beautiful fit, beautiful color. I ordered the purple. I'm a 34A and ordered a size medium and it was perfect."
"Thin fabric, should order true to size. It was too big."
Everything as expected.  Fits nicely
"a bit large, but expected that.  very comfy and easy to wear. great price for Teva!"
They are adorable!  The more I wear them the better they feel.
"I had to return original for size.  Next smallest size fit great and she loves it.  Good quality, soft and comfortable."
"Very nice dress, design not like anything I've seen in stores. Love the variety of color combinations to choose from. Fit was just right, you have to check size chart carefully since not American sizes. Overall, good fabric, nice color and just as described by seller."
This is a comfortable shoe and a good price.  Delivered when promised.
"This watch is exactly as  I I wanted, it is gorgeous and everyone ask about it,. I am proud  of wear it. Thank you."
I BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON.IT 'S COMFORTABLE BUT JUST A LITTLE LARGE.
Got it for my little girl's Girl Scout pins.  She is always playing with it that the metals pins came loose or it just comes apart for no resin.  These rubber tips are tight and just want I need to keep those pins secure.
Excellent! My 11 year old son loves it.
"very soft, sometimes i clean my computer screen with them, there is ajustable straps but personally i did not need them because they fit on perfect as is. 10/10 overall great buy!"
"Drapes body nicely, cozy, washes well, nicely made.  Makes me feel put together when I need a little more coverage."
perfect toe ring
I wish the actual clip portion was larger but this is a super cute hair flower and I wear it all the time!
I have purchased these shoes many times and they are the best shoes I have ever owned. So comfortable. I buy them over and over.
"Salomon shoes are the only shoes I will ever buy again in my lifetime. As long as they keep up this kind of quality, they have a loyal customer for life. I love the colors of these shoes. They are most definitely the most vibrant shoes I own to date, and they are so unique they get a lot of looks and compliments. Not to mention how supportive and comfortable they are. Best shoes on the market. Buy Salomon!!"
Too snug in thigh. I'm size 16.
"Great look, somewhat comfortable and I can reach the upper shelves (haha) Glad I bought these."
"I was a bit skeptical that the boots would look as good as they did on the web. I wan't disappointed, they were great and fitted like a glove"
These gloves fit very well and my husband will use them with his Santa Suit.
This is a very cute headband
"Smaller than I anticipated. Not quite big enough for a full size brush and I had a hard time finding space for a tooth brush to fit.
overall nice but I had hoped it was bigger."
Rugged but classy! Love it!
"My girlfriend is 7.5 sometimes an 8 in flat shoes. I read other reviews to get a size up so I got the 9/10 L for her. She liked the fit, snug with a lil wiggle room. Good quality and definitely not cheaply made."
"Loved the shoes, they were just too big. So I returned them for the correct size. If that size fits Ill be purchasing them in different colors as well"
"A bit tight for my big head, but still wearable.  Nice style and fabric."
Well made quality material but too small. Will return for larger size. Would recommend to a friend!  Good value for  price!
"The seal worked well, despite the handle being cracked. It looks like it was tightened too tight and it cracked in the process. For the price, I'm not going to worry about it. The handle can be replaced, if it cracks any further and prevents to hold the seal."
I get compliments on it all the time. I just wish it was a little longer.
Good New Balance Shoe
"The VICHY PURETE THERMALE works like it should.

I used it the other night to remove makeup and Urban Decay's 24/7 Eyeliner, I went to the Madonna concert and wanted a certain look, and it worked like a charm. I thought it was going to burn my eyes because it took several wipes to remove the eyeliner but it didn't. Also, it didn't coat my contact lenses with oil, which makes them temporarily blurry, like I sometimes get with baby oil, so that's a plus.

Even though the directions on the VICHY PURETE says you don't have to rinse after wiping, I rinsed my face off anyway because I didn't want to any residue on my face.

It hasn't broken me out and the formula is very mild and doesn't sting when applied."
This item is a great fit I will buy from this material again
Very pretty. Material does not stick to body. Bottom very free flowing.
"I ordered this in ""Olive"", and procrastinated quite a while after reading that it had some metallic/shimmer threading. When it dropped from $19.99 to $9.99, I figured I'd take a chance. SO glad I did! The color is beautiful, it's VERY soft, not at all scratchy/itchy and if it has the metallic/shimmer threading, it's not at all noticeable...because I looked...really closely! It may be more noticeable in the other colors, but not in the Olive color, thank goodness :)"
Bought 32C in this bra (what I usually wear) perfect fit ! Looks very sleek and is very comfy!  I will need to be careful when washing them though because the material is very soft and could look horrible if snagged. These bras are lightly padded . I have full breasts and push ups give my breasts an unnatural look so I'm happy with the light padding . Love them !
Very nice.  Great for winter.  We'll see how they wash.
"Perfect boot laces, just the right amount of give to make them much more comfortable than the original black.  and they look great."
"Husband is 80 and a little hard for him to put on, but size 10 fits fine and light weight for him to walk in."
"I love everything about this ring. I'm really into silver jewelry, so the combo of silver & gold is perfect. Looks great paired with a gold watch or bracelet. Very cute!"
"I had to return a previous, identical pair because the first time I put them on the top right lace eyelet popped out.  But I have been wearing Nevados shoes for over twelve years, and that was the first time I had ever experienced a defect.  I sent the shoes back and got a full refund.  Good shoes!"
"These are really cute.  The soles are a little narrow, so I will need some sort of insole in them.  The heels are slightly narrow too.  I have not actually worn them yet but I think they will be comfortable."
"Favorite shirt. We'll get her out of it she wears it everyday. It is very boxy, and not fitted at all"
"I bought these boots for a friend that has trouble walking, because of arthritis. She wears them everywhere now. They are flexible, adjustable, and have good traction in the snow. The arch support is a bit lacking, but one can wear orthopedic inserts if needed. My friend seems to like them just the way they are. The price is good too."
they are great shoes the best
Perfect for what I needed - a cheap hat to take traveling around the world with me. It survived the whole trip including an elephant trying to steal it!
"Great! I have been looking for a solution to prevent my excessive sweat dripping in my eyes - elastic headbands are either too loose or too tight, and have too little material to properly absorb and then evaporate the sweat. I finally remembered wearing something like these long ago and far away (Viet Nam, 1969-1970) and thought I would try it again. They are big enough, superb for my use, and easy to use. A couple of quick folds to a sort-of-triangle shape, then tie it over the head with a square knot then flip over & tuck the large part. It keeps me much drier and also cool. So far they are holding up well. I will be buying more."
"I love the fleece leggings, they really keep you warm."
This turned out to be a great buy. It looks so adorable on my teen daughter and looks great with so many outfits! She wore it so frequently that my teen son started borrowing it from her and it also looks awesome with many of his outfits (and he is clothing obsessed and will dress up to go to the grocery store). I am going to buy a second one for him so they don't have to share. The hat is flexible but sturdy and held it shape even while stuffed into carry-on luggage for a flight.
"Very Cute! Great as a photo Prop, but not so great as an every day Hat lol. The eye pieces are pretty delicate. But the inside of the hat is very soft and the outside is a nice material too."
Runs smalll.
wonderfully warm robe thats long enough to cover my ankles without dragging the floor. I hate too short robes! The hood comes in handy when I have to run the dogs out to their yard in the windy winter weather or get the mail. Im 54 & got the medium size which is ample on me.
The red looks amazing on me 
Cute. Nice for the price.
The item was kinda small
Fit great and shows no lines under jeans or gym tights. I love them need another set.
"The short fit perfectly and seems to be Good Quality. I am very happy with it, and my son who it was a birthday gift for, really likes it too!."
"I really like this sweater, it is pretty much what I was looking for. I am very particular about how my sweaters look. This one hangs just above the hips, like it is shown on the woman in the photo.

I'm 5'5 170 lbs, and I got a large. The last sweater I ordered, I bought an extra large and thought it was huge, so I decided to go large for this one. I can wear the sweater buttoned or unbuttoned. It fits well if it is open, but is tight if I button it. I would consider it more of a junior's large than a woman's large. But it is still very cute and I plan on wearing it a lot!"
"These jeans fit well and are constructed well.  I love them, they are my favorite brand and the price is exceptional."
"I bought this for my honeymoon vacation.  When I tried it on my fiance said, ""yeeeeeees!""  It clings to my shape perfectly and looks very expensive and elegant.  Two thumbs up!"
Best of all my grandson love it.
"Super shoe!!  My son has wide feet and I've purchased other Stride Rite shoes in the wide size, but they weren't wide enough.  This shoe in wide is just perfect."
Favorite belt. Nice size for most all loops. Easy to reverse. Seems to wear well.
on their third year.
I can never ever wear hats or beanies because my hair pushes the hats up and away. This one is working for me!!!
This was a gift and she loved them.
"Love these. Short girls-- these are for you. It's hard to find a pair of leggings that don't keep going past my feet. These are perfect. The fit is nice too-- high enough on the waist to feel comfortable, but don't dig anywhere. The material is nice-- easy enough to dress up with a pair of boots. I will definitely buy again."
"Would have given 5 stars, but gets sweat stains way too easily."
I was skeptical about ordering earrings but these are the perfect length and weight.
Surprisingly comfortable and effective. if you find your balls falling between your legs this does it. It is not constricting just up lifting. Provides a nice total package look under whatever you are wearing. A 10 timea better product than good devil. Comfortable enough to sleep in. Supporrive for those with prostatitis.
"Brought to you by the company that specializes in hiking boots, the Merrell Men's Realm Lace Oxford puts the functionality and comfort expected in a high-performance trail-blazing shoe into a dress shoe. Incredibly durable, the shoe empowers its wearer to grip, sprint, and maneuver while dressing up. Ideal for those who must perform physical function while looking professional (TV news reporters, wedding photographers, law enforcement, etc.), this shoe is for people who care more about performing well than turning their feet into a status symbol."
"Loving these wrap dresses!! Always get complimented on them. I think i've bought like 10 of these dresses. They are beautiful!! I've bought them in different brands but all seem to be same quality and all fit in same size. This is like TUA and another brand dress i found. I bought medium, I'm 5'4'' 135lbs size D chest if this helps. Perfect length to combine with wedge shoes. If you wear sandals with these though you will have to probably hem them. It is long and flowy and beautiful with my wedge shoes. And the dress is stretchy. Material is nice. I did buy one that was thin, but only one i didn't like as much as this one and ones mentioned. I bought all the on trend ones i found for sure!!"
Nothing else to say than my hubby loves them. They are his third pair.
I get one pair of reefs a year.  Best sandals in the game
"Bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift, will know how she likes it then"
"Didn't try on was mistake order, husband had another costume.  Looked great in package.."
These are so comfortable!  Im plus size but these don't squeeze the fat on my legs.  I love wearing them under sun dresses just in case oh a big wind.
"I love the colors, 24 pieces is such a great deal. I like the headbands because they do not slip or hurt my head. This set comes with pony tail holders that match the headbands. I always ware my hair up and these hold up my hair very well. I am very happy to have found this set of 24.

Disclaimer: I bought this product for a reduced price for testing purposes."
"I just realized I am wearing this shirt as I am typing this! Anyways, this is overall a great shirt and helps hide my ""mommy tummy."" This fits loosely and very comfortably while still maintaining a stylish look. It runs just a little small, so I am glad I bought it one size too big. What is nice is that even if you buy it a little too big it doesn't look bad because it plays into that loose fit look nicely."
"Perfect for a very light pendant.  Very pretty, and doesn't distract the eye from the pendant. I really like it a lot, and can't believe the value for the price!"
"I was given the chance to try shoes for free thanks to Stride Rite and BzzAgent and I chose this style of sandal expecting them to be a good option for Summer, when my 18 month old wouldn't want to wear socks. They have been great for playing on the playground and at the beach - the sand and dirt brushes right off of the leather and they continue to LOOK brand new even though he's worn them every day for a month. Unfortunately, they don't SMELL brand new. My little man has sweaty feet and these shoes are stinky! I just don't think he was meant to wear leather and mesh shoes all Summer. The Stride Rite brand is high quality and these sandals look great and go with everything. My son has feet that are every so slightly wider than normal (although not wide enough to warrant buying wide shoes) and I found that these shoes were the perfect width, not too narrow. I love that these shoes (and the entire Stride Rite brand) offer so much support as he is still a toddler, but we are going to have to switch to Crocs or something similar for day-to-day wear. These sandals will be excellent special-occasion Summer shoes."
Perfect!!! Had to buy another one for my husband!
Pretty and big
My daughter loves these shoes. They  come in wide which is great. They are hard to get on the foot but once on they are fine.
"I'm 5'3"", 135lbs and I ordered a medium and it fit great. Its a little tight around my belly but I was expecting this as I have a little pudge. This is a great dress to wear to work, dinner party or at x-mas time."
"I have to have a specific color of uniforms for work and these arrived and they are perfect. The sizing holds true, packaging was well, and they are a great fit!! I will be ordering more of these in the future!"
"The wallet look like it made of good quality and have many pockets that I need for my credit cards, insurance cards, and store cards.  The wallet was also well pack to prevent damage."
Great fit and fabric- esp for price
"I bought this a bit large on purpose and put it in the dryer. The gown shrunk a bit and is fine. The robe shrunk in the sleeves, which isn't what I really wanted to have happen, but it is fine. If you order the size you normally wear, I'd encourage you to cold water wash it the first few times. Otherwise, I really am pleased."
It is very comfortable and it doesn't snag on clothes or your hair which was a nice surprise.  Nice ring if you don't want to wear the real thing!
"Well made leather belt for jeans and camo shorts. I like all the holes cuz my weight goes up and down a lot, LOL!"
"Arrived in good shape, good quality watch band, keeps excellent time, easy to read and for the money an excellent buy."
"This was a gift. While the dress appeared to be good quality for the price, the tiara had jewels falling off."
"I love the look of the shoe, it is a little tight on the front.  I expected to be a little more comfortable."
Love these! I think they look better in person!
The stones are very pretty and in the setting the look fantastic. As others have stated the backing is a bit flimsy but my wife recently started using some very inexpensive rubber backings that work wonderfully with these.
"This certainly gets a lot of attention.  Everyone notices it.  It washes well, the printing does not come off."
"These are the cutest Mickey and Minnie Mouse earrings for little girls that I have found online. My children are huge fans of Mickey and Minnie and I also wanted earrings that had the screwback closure feature . I feel that is important for kids we wouldn't have any issues with the earrings becoming lose or losing a back. These earrings are not too large for my 3 year old but also look good on my 5 year olds larger ears. There was a large variety of colors but we chose pink and blue and they are super sparkly in person and have a nice lightweight feel to them so they don't make their earlobes droop. They are a silver color with the silver locking balls and then the colored mouse head in the front.

These shipped out very quickly via prime shipping and also came in a cute little red box, which the kids liked because it made them ""fancier"" in their words. These are great for a Disney fan and even an adult could wear them if they wanted to."
They fit perfect.like the color.well made.
"Other then being too big. It's beautiful, goes with almost everything and fit good"
"This is a nice shoe, but it really is a lot higher and narrower than I expected. The shoes are of good quality and I look forward to wearing them this spring/summer."
"Love it!  I wear it myself-""Hang in there!"" I get lots of compliments."
"This is my first pair of Reefs.  I was searching for Rainbows and read about Reefs in some of the Rainbow reviews.  I live in sandals as long as the weather will allow, which can be 6 months here in the south, so I figured I'd try some Reefs.  Just got them today and they are soooo comfortable!  Just love them.  I wear an 8 which is what I ordered and they just fit.  My heel comes just about to the end of the foot bed - no extra room.  Hope they last."
"I Like it so much that I ordered a 2nd one in a different color.  looks nice and super comfortable, and after a few washings, I can say it ""washes well"""
my husband loves the shirt fits perfect
"Overall seems to be very nice. Quality material (though maybe not 100% natural leather - a bit of a plastic smell) and well constructed. Only complaint is that one of the card pockets had a big glob of glue in it that got all over a credit card. Easy enough to clean up, but still. Haven't taken the ultimate test to see if the RFID blocking works, but I trust it. Overall, happy with it."
It's not a clingy stretchy material like I was assuming it would be by the pictures and reviews. More stiff. Still a nice v neck. I'm 5'7 and 190 and bought the XL. Fit nicely.
"I love this tee. It is a but see thru but I simply wear a nude bra with it and problem solved. I love that it's a little lower cut than most tees. Know that it is a little longer than most tees, but fits great. I'm usually an XL but they only had a LG available when I ordered and I'm really glad because an XL would have been way too big."
SOOOOOOOO Soft. I love it! I ordered it a bit bigger than fitted and it's so comfy. I would totally re-order this item! I plan to get the other patterns too!
When I took this petticoat out of the package and saw the waist I thought that there was no way this was going to fit. Wow! Was I surprised. It fit perfectly. And it's absolutely adorable. I'd say it is true to size. The service was faster than I expected. You can wear this as a skirt as you can't see through it. This was a good buy and I'm glad that I purchased it. Good quality. A+
"Super comfy. No problem washing by hand or machine. Not crazy about pulling it overhead to get it on, but that is the style, and it does what it should."
But too small!
"These fit like dress pants from the early 90's that I remember. A tiny bit baggy, roomy and comfortable. Not too thin or cheap looking. I ordered the black colored ones 34x32. No complaints here."
I guess it is fine.
Wonderful. Far better than I imagined! Especially for the price. Highly recommend.
I was hesitant to spend this much on a purse I couldn't see or feel in person but I'm glad I took the chance and with free returns you really have nothing to lose. This purse comes with a lifetime warranty and I can see why. It's SUPER durable and the zippers are really easy to open and close. I love that in a purse. It's the perfect size. I did remove the red logo patch on the front and replaced it with a different decorative patch instead. Now this is the only purse I'll ever need!! It's really worth every penny. I love it.
Love this pair of 18g small barbell earrings!! They are perfect for my ears (I have small ears)!!
Yep! All of the above and gotta love the price too
"I'm a Baggallini fan. This is the best one yet. It's big enough for everything, including a small camera, cell phone, makeup, you name it. Great organization -- typical of Baggallini. And this is a gorgeous, rich color."
It looks the same as in the picture.  I think the tutu skirts should have a liner the material was bit too rough for my one year old
"But the sleeves are way too long for me, at least 4 inches too long.  I can roll them up and still wear it.  Would prefer if it was 3/4 sleeves.  It's great under a sleeveless top with a sweater."
My husband had one of these before and loved it.
Perfect travel billfold and now I use it all the time
Totally love these! I have plantar faciatis and work on my feet all day long. Got these to give a try and immediately felt better cushion than my under armor and Nike ones. They felt so amazing I now own 3 pair 
"Sheer, but looks good with a tank underneath."
VERY NICE! (^_^)
In very happy with the quality. Just one thing is my sun is very slim and they run quite wide and extra long
I'll probably buy another pair of these PJ's. I could live in them.  They are so soft and comfy. Love them!
Alittle long but great material and fit around the waist
Easy to read numbers and date on watch face.  The indiglo  light is perfect for reading the time in the dark.  Keeps perfect time and looks great.
"Cute cute, am a M I got. M"
"My 21-month-old son has refused to take these off for two days, so far..."
"These were a gift for my stepdaughter.  That being said, I did not wear but she loves them & we have no complaints"
PErfect for my cosplay needs.
"These boots are wayyyyy cute and at such a great price from this seller but I tried everything to keep the inside from rubbing my ankle and nothing worked. Sadly I had to send them back but hey, if this seller ever comes up when you select a boot or whatever please know they are great! I thought my grandaughter had thrown the inserts of the boots away so I wasn't sure I could send them back...this seller said no problem! I found the inserts later that day before I shipped them but how great that it was not going to be an issue for me returning with no inserts. And of course Amazon is as great as ever!!!"
so cute for christmas
"The matte black heel was absolutely beautiful!

I usually wear a size 7 and that is the size I ordered. My feet are very wide and it was quite snug in the toe but I am not wearing these while walking around all day at my office job. The right shoe did start to kind of slide off my heel when walking but that was fixed with a thick Band-Aid.

I think if I had to walk around in these all day my feet would probably hurt like heck, but they serve their purpose for me and I would purchase again in different colors."
Great and light lift when running.
"BEST UMBRELLA EVER!!!!  I had initially invested in a similar umbrella that was only one color and it blinked, stayed solid and went lighter/darker, however after leaving that in a shopping cart somewhere, I found myself searching to replace it.  This is by far 10 times better than my last one.  It has multiple colors, has a flashlight that comes out of the bottom - great for walking at dusk or hard to see sidewalks/steps, and it comes with its own carrying bag.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!  Get one!!"
Great boots for day hiking.
"I wear shoe 6 to 7.5 and these were extremely large before washing. Fit better after washing and stay up during exercise, but offer no ""support"". Thought about returning,as there is no support and are thinner than I thought, but at least they stay up with my exercise shoes. Will see how they stay up for work for which I wear support hoes and these will be worn on top of support hoes for 12 + hours. Will update."
I've owned this luggage for 2 years now and have used it more times than I can count. It is greasy for traveling. The only thing that is a pain is it doesn't stand very well but not enough to get another one. I would buy thia again in a heartbeat. Lots of storage and durable. I would highly reccomend.
"I took a chance, I have never ordered a swimsuit online but after reading the reviews and seeing the pics it really helped me have some faith, I was going to order a plus size suit from an online company that caters to plus sizes but couldn't see paying over a $100 for a suit. I am so happy I ordered this suit the colors are so vibrant i love the hot pink plaid inset/lining and although the cups are a tad small I will just remove the padding"
So comfie.  Doesn't fall off my feet.  Totally washable.
"The dress is just beautiful and well made. I ordered an xl and I usually wear a 16-18 with a 40"" bust. It fits perfect and is very flattering. Thanks "
Was exactly what I expected.  Love the fit and color
"Absolutely love these socks and suggest them for all year round, I live in south Texas (McAllen area) and they work great in the heat which is what we get plenty of.  These are the most comfortable socks I've ever used and would suggest them.  The company suggest the 8-12 for most unless you have a larger narrow foot or vice versa if you have a normal foot but wider get the xl but they have plenty of stretch for fit without stretching out them too much."
"Nice looking,comfortable. Not much more to ask for !"
These boots are very comfortable and are exactly what I expected. I'm going on a year and a half with some signs of wear. And for my heavy use is amazing
This fit my average sized 8 year old son and was very cute! I removed one star because it smells very strongly of scented lotion or perfume or some sort of fragrance that disagrees with my nose.
Fits well and looks great.  A perfect style for a little boy.  Grandson loves it and doesn't want to wear anything else.
They are beautiful on. Take special care of feathers so they will last longer. Love them.
"Updated:

I bought two Amanti dress shirts: white and teal.

Both shirts are good and fit.

However, the WHITE shirt's actual color is VERY-BRIGHT-LEMON.

The second one is indeed TEAL.

Overall: four stars"
Xmas gift for my son. He loves it and I love that will will help him learn how to read a clock.
Quick delivery. Good value. Nice fit.
This is a very high quality hat at a very affordable price!
"These are cute and comfortable!
They are lightweight and have a rubber/synthetic sole.
The material on top is soft and makes wearing these sandals feel great.
They have a variety of cute colors and can be worn with many different clothing items.
These will be getting a lot of use in the summer and other months as well.
I personally like these with a summer dress.
I was a little concerned about maybe some uncomfortableness in the silver accent piece but that didn't happen at all.  Very excited for these sandals!
*I received these at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
"The shoes are very comfortable, but I am on my second pair because the sole of the first pair I had was torn when a small rock got wedged in the tread of the shoe. I have had no problems with my second pair so it might be that what happened was a freak accident, but did not feel like I could give a five star review for the shoes after what happened."
"Very, very good, beautiful and good quality"
I love this shirt. It is so flattering and fits as expected. I bought one in the olive and fell in love and bought it in black and purple.
"Love it. Size runs slightly small. Order one size up if you want to wear it often/under clothing. Order the size you think you fit if you just want it for lingerie.
I bought this with ""Daxin Women Sexy Underwire Bra Push Up Padded Lace Sheer"" in the matching Deep Purple color. The colors matched pretty closely and made a super cute little pair."
"This is an awesome backpack. The description of this backpack is dead on. It has pockets exactly where you need them making finding what you need while you're traveling ia breeze.  It's sturdy, attractive and everything you could ask her in a ttravel carry-on."
Love it for everyday shopping very light
"I usually order Sorel slippers,  but I didn't order when they were at a great price.  So I decided to give these a try.  No bad for the price."
"Just about 1/4 inch too short.  I went by my other New Balance shoes for the size. The width was fine (4E) but size 10 was a bit short. I think they'll stretch in time. I like their appearance and a half size larger might be too large. Because they're slip-ons, I feel I better stick with what I have. I wish I could try on the next 1/2 size larger, but that's the problem with buying shoes on line."
Ex- Girlfriend liked it.
Very warm and comfortable! I'm looking forward to wearing them on super cold days. Great boot adds style to any winter attire!  Super happy customer
"Great t-shirt, comfortable fabric, size appropriate to request."
"It fits great, good for running, and is good for workouts as well as it is not too heavy. Good buy for the price."
"Bought as a gift to give for Christmas.  The quality is decent and the color interesting.  It does not look like the picture; however, the unique tone is a neutral that will go with most things.  If the picture had been correct, I would have definitely still placed the order.  It was not a big deal to me; but, worth noting for others thinking of buying it."
Need to get more for next year.
"Has lasted all summer, and still going"
Classy look and feels great
Someone told me I looked like Kourtney Kardashian- it doesn't get much better than that ;)
"Perfect!  Ordered a size 8 in black for my 7 yr old.  She is tall and has room to grow in the sleeves (hope it will work next year as well.)  It is a great dress coat for church each Sunday and other Holiday outings.  Not the warmest coat, but it is just what we were looking for and a great price."
Nice to find jeans that don't change the fit every year!
Just exactly what I was looking for. The cz's are beautiful and I love the cut. They are very sparkly and perfect.
Fits great and will definitely keep me warm.
"Great for the price, I've worn them like 5 times and they r good"
"Other than the fact that the shoes were a little big for me, I just sent them back and ordered a smaller size, they are super comfortable.

The reason I felt the shoes were a little big, they are a Velcro closure and I wasn't able to make the strap tight enough to feel safe around my ankle."
Seems to fit as expected. Pretty good quality.
"First, many thanks to the reviewer who suggested buying these a size up if you'll be wearing these for active pursuits.  I did just that and the extra roominess was exactly perfect for hiking a portion of the AT.

These pants are very light, and as such very comfortable.  I didn't have any issues with durability, although I will say the belt that comes with the pants is rubbish.  Do yourself a favor and replace the belt with the 5.11 TDU 1.5-Inch Belt.  The combination is superb.

My only real nit with these pants is the zipper design, on both the pant legs and the fly.  They are fine-toothed zippers, meaning they will likely not hold up under serious outdoor activity.  So if you're looking to wear these on anything but casual hikes (even intermediate I'd be careful), know that the zippers may cause you trouble down the line.

I will say that I had to go across a stream and took a wrong step which resulted in a very wet leg.  Within 30 minutes the pant leg was quite dry.  So when people are saying these are fast-drying pants, they are not exaggerating.

Quick note - I ordered the gravel color.  The color is hard to make out on the photo.  It's not as olive drab as it looks, but rather olive with a healthy amount of gray cast to it.  Think very dark olive khaki, darker than, say, Boy Scout uniform pants.  It is a very outdoorsy color.

I'm very happy with these pants.  They are versatile and work well!"
I purchased these for my husband as a late Christmas present. Awesome price and a great fit for him as he has a wide foot and hard to locate shoes that fit
"The waist fit exactly like it should. The only thing is that if you don't like BAGGY CLOTHES, then choose something else. When it said Loose fit they should really say BAGGY fit.. Other than that they are perfect."
Great casual and light summer vest.
"Super comfortable boots. The leather is quality, fit is spot on, can wear them all day with no problems! Great purchase!!"
These ran about a half size too small. I had to send back size 11 for size 11.5  My daughter loves them!
"Great hat to keep the sun off the face. Also warm enough for the summer. Shipped fast, thank you!"
"Fabulous!!! Size up for extream comfort. I am 131lbs, lean/fit.strong back 38.  Xl fits so so comfortable. I love it"
"Good quality, fit well and look good"
Good Product and works as described
"Super thick, warm, good colors, long enough to wear with boots, and made in America. Buy these instead of those other boot socks made in China. They'll last you forever. (no, I don't work for the company, just know a good thing when I buy it)"
I bought this for one of my daughters and she truly loves it.  She is 19 years old and very picky about what she wears.  Again She loves it!!
Great watch when a larger face is needed.  Like that Timex does the unisex watches.  Great Custsomer Service.
"I tried a Havaianas off my friend and it felt really cushiony and soft.  Bought a pair that actually fit from his recommendation and it was AWESOME.  The thing literally is like wearing an anti-fatigue mat on your feet.  The only caveat is that the top strap can kinda be rough around the edges and you have to carefully scrape the extra plastic off.  Other than that the footbed fits as expected, you just need to measure your foot in cm to get a proper fit, it's true to size.  No guesswork like the Crocs, one pair M6 could be too small, and the M7 fit just right.  I even have a pair of Crocs Athens that's a M5, and fits EXACTLY the same as another pair that's M6.  Go figure."
Much better than I expected it to be. I wish I would've bought this a long time ago!
This is the second pair purchased.  I'm hard on shoes and these hold up to heavy use and water.
Was dissapointed it was all manmade material but beautiful regardless and def. worth the excellent price.  It is tea length dress with the cape seeming slightly longer.  The dress is white not ivory like it looks in the picture.  There are three buttons up the back and it can be worn with or without the cape.  Traditionally the cape is put on after the baptism to represent the change in the spiritual state but if you have a christening it could be worn either way.  It arrived in a timely manner and in an envelope instead of a box. I would order again
"I adore the print!  The bright colors ork all year and the black makes it okay for winter.  I use this casually when I need to run around with my kids without a handbag but need my phone and wallet with me. The hipster style is perfect and hands free. The point of this purse for me, is to save my phone from accidents that occur when it is in my back pocket...and I forget it is there."
you can't use them all day because there's a seam under the strap that is chafing
Buy a size larger ...I like the shirt
"As usual, this Lee product fit perfectly."
Very comfortable! Very happy with this purchase. Good value.
I have a narrow foot and am quite reluctant to order a shoe without trying it on first.  I took a risk on this one and am quite happy with the fit.  It comfortable and looks great.
Love these.  Glad I read the reviews and ordered up a half size. I love them and have already  ordered myself a 2nd pair.  Shipment was super speedy.
"This wallet was even nicer than described. I use and abuse it daily and it still looks great. I love the flower embossment, i purchased black. There are card holders, pockets and a zippered coin holder on the inside. Very durable, the gold tone zipper works smoothly. I would recommend this for anyone to use, great for a gift, too! I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Nice inexpensive piece of jewelry that my daughter will love. Pleasantly surprised to see it was made in USA.
"The zipper and waistband at the top tends to roll in the wash.

The fit is great and comfortable to wear for long periods of time.

Wide belt loops allow inter-changing of belts.

Light fabric- but works in warm or cooler climates."
"my fourth pair of Saucony and I love it. they always fit perfectly. any shoe of size 10 will always fit the same, so I know I won't have a return headache. excellent price to boot!"
Super great price for a excellent price. Would recommend to a friend.
Love the shoes; love the fit.
Look like they do in the pictures. Cute.
GOOD PRICE.
Great just what was needed
These are a must have for any woman that likes to pamper her feet after having to wear high heels all day!  I love these and I hope that Isotoner always has these for sale so I can buy them for gifts or buy a replacement pair.
"Excelent quality of the fabric, really beautifull dress!!!!"
Works well!  The quick release mechanisms seem superior to the Ritchie brand.
Nice set of belts. The leather ends and buckles match the belts nicely. They are well stitched and have a nice stretch to them. They look like they are expensive but the price was very reasonable. Well worth it.
This wig is very full with lots of tracks. It feels much softer than other wigs in this price range as well. I received many compliments on it. Will definitely be buying again in other colors.
Love!!! Wear these all of the time. I have a wide foot and my size fit perfectly. So cute! I'm in education and can wear these to jazz up work outfits or out for a night on the town.
Fits great. I take a size 9 and and I ordered a 9.
"I may come back and edit this review if things change, but here are my first thoughts. The band feels tight. It might be because my old bras are really, really old, and very ""relaxed"", or it might be that the band actually does run a little small. The cups fit well enough almost there is some looseness at the tip of the breast, though its very minor. Its comfortable except for the snugness, which will hopefully abate a bit with wear.

Now I generally only buy bras with wire in them, but 3/4 of them the wire rips out the first time they get washed. When you're wearing larger sizes, that gets old fast because good bras are not cheap! I bought this one because maybe, just maybe, I can feel supported in a non-underwire bra. Do I feel supported? Yes and no. The girls aren't hanging low, but the bra is pulling them outwards a bit, which makes them seem larger then normal. I'm not sure if I'm okay with that. I now this is not a minimizer bra but they really don't need to be enhanced.

Would I buy this bra again? Maybe. I would probably go up a band size if I did."
Took forever to get here so it only gets four stars. Quality wise it's a five.
Got these gloves for my brother who lives in New York and is always on his phone. He loved it!
It looks cool and is a little smaller than it seems in the picture which is a good thing I was worried it was going to be the size of a volleyball.  Instructions are a little vague but is easy enough to figure out and keeps my watch running and me on time
"Really enjoy the fit, materials nice and I always get compliments on it. Really can't find anything I don't like about it."
My daughter really likes these and is very comfortable in them.
comfy and cute..many compliments
I love and very durable the Rockport brand. Small sizes in dress shoes are hard to find - these are well fitting
"For diamond earrings this price it's a real deal.  They are gorgeous.  Sparkly, well made and just the perfect size.  Not  too small and not too large.  Just right, love them!"
"Great ring- I LOVE my KONOV Jewelry Stainless Steel Unisex Claddagh Heart Crown Ring!!! It has great weight to it, and it's stailess steel so it's going to be solid and heavy- I love the feel. It is very well made, and detailed. Durable, well polished and you just won't scratch or wear this ring out- it looks like the finest grade sterling silver!!!SUPER SHINY- It just gleams and glints! Very, very eye catching. You can see your face of yourself or your true love can see theirs reflected in the heart, when they look in it- JUST TRY IT!!! It's kind of romantic, and very fitting I think to the true theme of the ring!!! Kudos Konov- bet they didn't think of that hidden feature! Being of 100% Irish descent the claddagh is a symbol of great meaning to us and I saw this and  just had to have it!!! The shipping from China also came lightning fast which was also a major plus- The ring came in a very pretty black velvet bag and had a suprise inside with it: a silver necklace as a bonus gift!!! The necklace is so pretty and delicate. I love it and can't wait to order a silver charm from Konov to put on it! I have received many compliments on  my ring so far, and I would buy another ring from KONOV jewelry again in a heartbeat- you can't beat their prices!!! People ask where I bought it from and I tell them it's my little secret because I want to be the only one with this particular claddagh! Call me greedy but it's just to special to let anyone else I know copy me, ha-ha! I want to be the only one I know with this particular claddagh design! 5 stars out of 5 for this amazing ring."
My granddaughter has a pair of size 2 shoes and they fit her these won't fit for a long time they were big
"So far so good.  I just got the socks, and they fit as expected.  The heal stays up and hugs the heel.  Let's see how long they last.  The colors are pretty cool"
Perfect valentine gift.
Width seems good. Arch and ankle support also seems good. A little uncomfortable around the collar of the boot - hope that will abide .
Love them!!! I'm glad I bought these they fit perfectly!!!
"This is super cute! It's very convienent and easy to clean. I'm not sure if the price can be justified, but hopefully it will last me a long time!"
"My daughter loves these shorts, they are perfect for her soccer games. I love that they make them in pink!"
A gift. They really liked the shirts but they did run a little small.
This sweater fit as expected and looks like the picture. It is true to size and very soft!
"Shoes are nice. They don't grip well on wet rocks, but that's kind of to be expected. Then again it was my pregnant wife wearing them. She did say her feet were not sore after miles of hiking. Pregnant woman approved."
"The earrings were exactly what I expected. They were lightweight and thin but,  good quality.  Can't beat the price and definitely worth it. Totally pleased."
"Great sandals,well made, true to size."
"My boy has never liked thongs, so I bought these for him as an alternative. He has outgrown several pairs and absolutely loves them. They're convenient and extremely durable, and their simple design and color goes with any summer clothes. They go in water, on grass, wherever, and he never has to worry about cleaning or drying them. He's on his 3rd pair now.

One thing you should know: These are engineered for quite wide feet, so if your child's feet are narrow, the strap won't do much to ""hold"" the slide on the foot. No biggie for my boy, but if you need sandals for active sports, these are likely to fly off all but the widest foot."
"Wife enjoyed this until her c-section healed. After a few weeks though she didn't really seem to find it comfortable/necessary. It was much better quality that the band the hospital gave us, and I would recommend. Provided a good amount of support and was not bulky. Only con was I thought it seemed a touch expensive, but I think that's a pretty subjective issue. It helped her feel better after her surgery, so it was worth it."
"These are well made with all sorts of high tech materials, lightweight, exceptionally well cushioned, Vibram soles, (camo soles at that!) more comfortable than my sheepskin slippers or any boots I have ever owned (I'm 56), you won't curse them at the end of a long day, they are no longer made, but if you find a pair you won't go wrong."
"Probably the best pair of sandals I ever owned. Goes with brown or black, cute enough without being cutesy, and comfy as all heck. I though the Velcro adjustment would bother me, but I hardly notice it. Fit great, and handling this awful rainy Pennsylvania summer just fine!"
Love love this!!!!
"Obsessed with these onesies. Fabric is heavenly. I just bought a bunch more. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have wasted money on any other clothing. Perfect for newborns sensitive skin. Cool and comfy. Pricey, but so worth it. I wash this constantly so she can wear it day after day. Love love love"
"These sandals are great.  Just like the other reviews have stated, they do run a bit large, but plenty wide enough.  I wear a size 8.5 shoe size, but I ordered a size 7 in these.  For the price, these are comfortable and very durable.  Excellent for water sports (like kayaking!)  They velcro on both sides, and the toggle on top makes it easy to adjust the fit.  I would definitely recommend."
"I love the style of these shoes, along with the fit and feel.  They are lightweight and allow your foot to breathe and they are comfortable and appear to be good quality."
"These are really nice cargo shorts.  Very well made and very true to size.
Highly recommended for that person in your life who needs some nice shorts.
Wrangler can  be counted on to make a quality piece of clothing in my opinion....last and last and last.  Hold up to lots of wear and washing."
Love this shirt!! Put it on and didn't want to take it off!! So silky and the perfect thickness for those cold hospitals!
"I've seen the Sanuk Yoga Sling around for awhile but always thought the style was a little odd. It wasn't until I saw a family friend wearing them that I thought that maybe they could work for me! I read up on all the reviews and even though I usually order up with Sanuk's, I decided to get these in a 6 instead of my usual 7. I'm ordinarily a 6.5 and with Sanuk's full-sizes-only sizing, I usually get a 7 which gives me a little extra room...but since I'd seen some feedback saying that the bands slip off, I figured it'd be better to go smaller for a snugger fit. Depending on how you like your sandals to fit, you may want to go up if you're between sizes...I decided to keep the 6's since I don't like a lot of excess space anyway. I've included a photo so you can see how sizing down to a 6 fits my typically 6.5 feet...they juuuust fit.

I've had other Sanuka Yoga shoes before (Yoga Mat, Yoga Joy) so I knew the footbed of these would be comfy. Pair it with the stretchy soft material of the straps, and you've got a great casual weekend shoe. It doesn't have any arch support whatsoever, which keeps me from rating them 5 stars...I can wear them all day long (no rubbing/chafing of the straps), but my feet are tired at the end of the day with the lack of support. The style is cute with a laidback vibe which makes me feel like I should be wearing them on my way to a yoga class :P I'd buy more of these in all the other fun colors if I didn't already have too many shoes!"
"Gift for the ""penguin lover"". This bag covered with happy, little penguins made a nice gift for house guest . It is well made and very cheerful and sturdy at the same time. Timely shipping, as advertised and happy with the purchase. Thanks again to the seller and to Amazaon."
Nice pattern. Gave it as a gift for mother's day!
"I bought these to work out in as they're cotton, they're easy to wash and dry and keep you dry. They are thin enough for an undershirt or gym shirt."
This was a good buy however no one informed me nor was it in the description that the 4.0 is for extremely cold weather.  So I had to send it back and get the 2.0 for my husband which is more suitable for our climate in NC.  I wish someone had put that in the description.  It would have saved a lot of headache returning and reordering but the shirt is wonderful.  My husband works outside and he loves it and it is true to it's size.
I've been wearing these bras for years & have found them to be the most comfortable bras for my large bust.  I love the wide straps.
its a warm and a really good objet if you are living on a bad weather area. if feel good under rain and comfortable two.
Great fit.  Doesn't crawl or get in a twist....
these shoes looked really sharp with the faux animal shiny print incorporated into the design.  The alternating satin sheen leather really give this shoe a practical feel.
Great. My husband has Parkinson's and these are great for him.
I received my order timely; I'm very pleased with the fix with and quality of the material (some spandex).  The panty fits PERFECT (I'm very hippy).  The length is great too; I'm 5'7 and the dress is just above my needs.  The bra inserts are tacky; I cut the bra inserts out and tried it on again with a regular bra; it fits great with out the inserts.  Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.
"These are very soft and comfortable.  Nice soft, tagless waistband.  Colors are as pictured."
My husband loves these crazy kinds of rings so I buy him one for birthdays and anniversaries. He loved this one and gets a lot of cmpliments on it.
"The best ever! My son has wide\flat feet. They're perfect! So incredibly red and did I say cute!? I pulled them out the box and he's had them on his feet every since! Worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY!!

My son wears a size 7 wide and yes two."
"I wanted a white sweater for the summer, and I already have a cotton one, but it 'clings' and isn't comfortable.  This is more like a fabric than a knit, and it feels lovely on.  I bought my usual size, and it fits great.  I know I'll get a lot of use with this.  In fact, I just packed it for a trip I'm taking because it is a great 'extra' to have along."
LOVED IT\
"I chose this classification because it is excellent product!
I like variety to choose
I would recommend this product to my friends!"
I bought the gold plated earrings for a friend as a birthday gift. She plays keyboard so I figured it would be a nice gift. When I gave it to her she immediately put them on. They look so nice on her and now I want a pair :D
"Beautiful leather boots, fast shipping."
"Love my boots, comfortable!"
Very cute and stylish. I love the fit and the style.
As described. Perfect for non-costume-loving people!
What can I say - it is gorgeous. I love this dress!!
Color is awesome and they are super cute. Run a teeny bit small but oh well ;)
Great top to wear with leggings or skinny jeans.
These are comfortable shoes that I like to wear with slacks and jeans.  No need to break in ----- size seems to fit normal shoe size.
"Thanks to previous reviews, I knew to up one size. Purchased 1x/2x and the length is good for my 5'6"" frame. Arm holes just right"
Really nice belt and quality for the price!  I'll be buying another in brown as well.
Love the material . Easily packable
I really love these shoes. They are dressy enough for work but can easily go with jeans and capris as well. There were so many color options that I am considering another pair in a different color.
"I'm a 7.5-8.5 depending on the shoe and the 39n fit perfectly.  This is my first pair of Birkenstocks and won't be my last.  Unfortunately I can't wear these for work for safety reasons, but I would if I could.  These are so simple and delicately styled and stay securely on the foot.  I haven't worn them in yet, but know I will be wearing these for years as long as my dog never finds them."
"I am very happy with the product, it looks just like the picture and it was packaged well, Overall a good product for the price.

*** 03/08/14  UPDATED REVIEW  The leggings do not stay up on my legs, they constantly roll down, but if you wear them with boots they might be fine."
"Great quality, a bit small for me but it's a nice top and as it's meant for layering, the tight isn't really an issue."
Great shoes have no issues when wearing them all day.  Actually did a lot of walking with these shoes on and they were very comfortable.  Received the product at a discount to review.  Would purchase again
Seems great so far! I like the backpack and I've received I think 3 compliments on it already.
I work from home and my office gets a bit chilly while I'm working. This is my go to sweater. I absolutely love it!
These are actually suprisingly good quality for the price.  They don't hurt my ears like most cheap earrings and are good for everyday wear
"Just beautiful, wish it was bigger!!!"
"If course you get what you pay for this material collects tons of dog hair, but it is good for the price and not wanting to leave the house.

Of all the pants we purchased, my husband liked these the best."
"Runs a little on the small size, but is a great shirt. Everyone loves it!"
"Love!
want more"
"This jacket is exactly what is was looking for, for my son. It is great for autumn weather and is very soft. I will say that it runs a little small. My son is 2 years old (a bigger 2 year old than most) and I ordered a 4T and its kinda tight on him. Order a size larger and you should be good."
"I will admit I love Harley-Davidson shoes.  I have never really found a pair that did not fit.  I tend to wear a 6 1/2 to a 7 when buying shoes. In Harleys, I always wear a 6 1/2.  These did not blister my feet which I normally have happen at some point with every pair of new shoes.  I have also received several compliments on them when I go out.  These are called Sapphire blue and they are close to that but with a touch of teal added to the color.  I do wish there was just a little bit of grip on the bottom because I live in an area that sees a lot of cold weather that can cause things to be a bit slick.  That would be the only thing I would change :)"
"This is a cute blazer! It is soft and stretchy and I can actually button it which is crazy since im very large chested. I'm a 16/18 and ordered this in the biggest size. On me it fits like a crop blazer which I don't have a problem with as its so cute. The arms aren't tight at all, and when moving around in it you never feel constricted. the spikes are sewn on well and will not be going anywhere."
"Feels a little small but it is a good quality hat, I'm sure with a little effort I can stretch the elastic and make it feel a bit more comfortable."
Great shoe fit's true to size and very comfortable.
I have a rather large foot and need a size 52 biking shoe.  I do not have a lot of choices to make my selection.  This was reasonably priced.  The shoe seems well constructed and durable.  We'll see ifit is inded durable. The buckle is easier to adjust than my previous (SIDI) shoe.  The fact that there are two positions for the bucle helps me since I have a very narow foot with low arch.  It fits very nicely.
"Second pair.  Comfortable, doesn't wrinkle too much.  Cell phone pocket is great, Fits iPhone 6 in Otterbox. Side  (not back-, not cargo-) pockets could be an inch deeper.  Also have a pair in Grey-Blue, same comments apply."
"I love these jocks. These are the softest, most comfy jocks I've ever had. I will be buying more. I wore jocks because my wife likes how they look, but the weren't the most comfortable. These are. I'll wear these because they're sexy and comfortable."
Omg this dress fit amazing.  Even though the material is thin I don't need a girdle or anything like this. Good purchase
Very good quality fabric. Very large at 5ft I could probably  wear as a dress. But super comfy. I am satisfied
I purchased this for my mother's bracelete and she loved it.
Comfy and high quality! Good temperature without overdoing it. Thanks.
"What a wonderful pendant necklace this is! Im not one for big bold, colorful jewelry; but rather classic gold & silver with a little gem or crystal. The delicate sterling silver chain, pearl & CZ of this piece lends a perfect touch of sparkle and interest.

The length of the necklace places the pendant right above the cleavage area, and looks wonderful with both low cut blouses/shirts or on top of sweaters/t-shirts. The sterling sliver chain catches the light and sparkles delightfully. The pearl is actually made from oyster shells, with a mother-of-pearl bead in the center. This gives weight to the pearl allowing it to feel substantial and drop beautifully. The use of oyster shell brings luster and depth to the pendant. The CZ is a perfect touch just above the pearl, that adds more sparkle to the whole piece. This is an especially perfect piece for the holidays.

This necklace is part of Amazons Curated Collection offering not only a wide range of other jewelry styles, but also accompanying pieces to go with this pearl/CZ piece."
"This is a WAW shoes I loveeeeeee it so much, and I recommended it very much to others its excatly as in the piture"
"The metal is NOT plated so it won't rub off from sweat or washing your hands. ATTENTION: The engagement ring goes on first. You get engaged first, then you get married and get the other ring (the wedding band) to seal in the nice engagement ring."
Girlfriend loves it!
Just perfect.  Thanks...
"I really didn't think I would like them when I first put them on, however I do love them.  The sling back style looks nice with capris and you can walk all day in these shoes.  They offer great arch support.  I definitely recommend this brand and style."
"Just perfect, it fits nicely."
"These are very cute, well made, warm tights for babies and toddlers. They do run very large. My child wears 6 month size in Carter's brands and is on the verge of growing out of them (16 lbs and 24 inches) but she has plenty of room to grow in the 0-6 month size of these tights so I would not recommend them for smaller babies."
This is a very cute dress.  The dress runs a bit long but it is still very cute.  Got tons of compliments.  The leggings are also quite thick.
"I wasn't sure when I ordered them, but I love them!"
"I purchased these as I can't wear high heels and I needed something for skirts and capris/skinny jeans. These were perfect. The first time I wore them, I didn't even realize they were new. They didn't rub or get uncomfortable.  They were stylish (got lots of compliments) and were exactly what I needed.  Perfect for warm summers here!  I would highly recommend."
Great quality and price $35+ for the exact one at target.
I got these bags as a gift for my bridesmaids. For the price it was worth it. They are made very well and all of the pockets make this bag an awesome gift.
"This is a very attractive set and comfortable to wear.  My husband gave me a diamond ring several years ago, and that is really all the ""real"" diamond I need.  I still love the look, and occasionally want to change it up a bit, and this set allows me to do that without the expense of diamonds.  I clean the rings with a very soft toothbrush and a small amount of toothpaste, rinse, and then dry them, and they shine beautifully."
"I got this as a replacement for a ring that I had to sell. It's so hard to believe that this looks as good as the $300.00 ring I had to give up.
Very happy with this petite and pretty ring."
Plan to use soon.  Hope to keep my luggage more organized.
"Got this for my friend Samantha a couple of years back, she loved it and looked fantastic in it"
"Cool, comfortable, can be dressed up or down...doesn't get better than that.  I'm only 5'2"" and wish they were another inch or two shorter but it's not always easy to find anything in the right length at my height (or lack of)! "
Looked good and delivered on time.
"these are holding up, not stinky and still annoyingly noticeable"
Fit perfectly and good quality
"This was not the first vest I had ordered from this company, My Grandson is a music major and we have several colors for his Tux. Also have used with a little adjustment for stage costumes."
my girls love the hello kitty watch
Did exactly what my husband needed for stretch some leather tennis shoes.  Just give it 24 hours to do the job.
"I run 50 miles a week, so go thru shoes pretty quickly!  I love these shoes!"
noce quality and price
"These run a little small but otherwise I love them. I have several blouses that I never wore because of their sheerness. Even with a camisole beneath them, the world could see the details of my camisole. These are just like a layer of opaque skin and one's bra disappears."
Just what I expected. He liked them but hasn't wore them yet.
"So cute, perfect for the occasion i need it for! It's a thin jacket but good quality so far!"
Great costume for the price.  Very good quality.
"Soft, my new favorite! Fits perfect, does not ride up on the behind or down on the belly area."
I love this loose fit on these pants and I have gotten compliments since the first day I've worn them.
to washed out
Comfortable for hikes walks and everyday use. I would most def recommend for this price and it came one time
"Perfect! The colour is the same as in the pic (I got the pink one), soft on the inside and super comfy! Looks cute and fits me perfectly. Didn't run small on me, even though I ordered small size and I'm not super fit or skinny (doesn't look tight on me at all). It is more on a thin side (material wise), so if you're looking for something to keep you super warm, you might need to find something else; but I wear it with a leather jacket over and it looks and feels great and keeps me warm in a rainy Washington."
"I tried them on and they fit fine, I'm 5'2 and have short legs. I plan on wearing a garter with them. They came in perfect condition and are soft and just as expected from the picture!"
"Looks as shown in photos, nice sturdy material & quick shipping. Good value for price paid!"
I was plesently surprised. I took a gamble in ordering bras off the internet. I didn't expect them to fit as perfectly as they did. They are also made of a really soft material and are very comfortable. I've always had a hard time finding bras so I'm really glad they fit!!
"Don't do half sizes needed 9.5 ordered 9 fit perfect. Chacos are amazing best sandal on the market, kinda spendy but worth it i mountain bike hike boat kayak and hit the bars all in the same shoe only regret is not buying sooner."
Soo many compliments! Purse looks classy and expensive. Love it to pieces!!
"This item is a nice buy, I have worn a lot of crocs before, was looking for something different and not common and I have it now. Though I wear size 11, but this 11 is a little bigger, but is fine for me."
I use these for my sports bras and they work wonderfully! They provide great support and are really comfortable.
"VERY WELL MADE!
MU DAUGHTER LOOOOOVE THEM!"
"Perfect fit, exactly what I expected"
"I love, love, love these slippers! I have been wearing them non-stop since they arrived two weeks ago. They are so comfortable. I've never had slippers so comfy. I wear a size 10.5 normally and these fit perfect, not too big or small, just right. The width is perfect. I am debating on buying another pair, that is how much I love these. I ended up buying my husband a pair of Acorn slippers for x-mas, because I love mine so much, Acorn has a sexy men's slipper, and I can't wait for my hubby to get them! I wish they made shoes this comfortable. They are so beautiful, well made, even non-slip (I think) as I wore them outside on a wet wooden deck with no problems. I highly recommend these slippers!

July 23, 2016
Update:
I've washed these slippers numerous times now on the gentle cycle, air dried them, and they have held up well, still just as comfortable as the day I got them. I've worn them outside to let my dogs out, even on wet freshly mowed grass, and discovered they are easy to wipe clean on the outside mat before coming inside, which is really cool.

December 6, 2016
Another Update:
Oh yeah, I bought another pair a few months ago. That is how much I adore these slippers! The first pair is still holding up well to washings. I wear them whenever I go outside in the backyard, mostly walking on grass. They are slightly worn looking compared to the new pair. The new pair I wear around the house and in the front yard (mostly walking on the side walk). I even wore them to the ER recently, because I felt like I could get away with it and why the heck not, I thought I was dying. Hehe. I wish I could find comfortable shoes like these slippers for going out on town!"
"I like the overall fit, the fabric, the arm holes, but the chest opening is a bit large and low."
These are great sweatpants. They seems well made and they're the perfect balance between thick and lightweight. I even ordered a second pair.
"The shoes are noting special. Well,  you cant expect more than that for 20 dollars"
"I only use asics - the fit my wide feet, provide great support, wear well, are durable, etc... But some models have been more or less solid than others.  This model is my favorite so far: the fit is snug, the cushioning excellent."
"It arrived on time and was appropriately package.  Nice shoe, nice colour."
Bought it for a friend. Mine fortunately came with the trident. It was very well received
"I really like the softness of the cotton!  The enclosed elastic waistband is gentle and doesn't show through clothes.
I will order these briefs again."
"Great looking ring, very comfortable."
"Purchased the wrong size, but the string held it up well. They were comfortable."
This is gorgeous. I went a size up after reading the reviews and glad I did because it is a perfect fit. I definitely recommend going a size up to my busty ladies as corsets can be quite constricting. The gloves are a bit small on me but I have big arms so I'll just stretch them a little. overall I am absolutely satisfied with this!!
"Boots are great looking and fit very well. Fast delivery to boot. (sorry, had to write that)"
"The pavement color is closer to a dark gray and that's fine with me. Made of a soft cotton fabric,  every stitch is well done and the detailing is attractive. I especially like the sunglasses loop above a pocket and the smooth buttons."
shoes fit perfect and not too heavy
So far is better than any other belt I've owned
"Good Purchase! I was recommended by my friend about the nice scarf with an amazing price, I made the order without any hesitation. The color is wonderful which can give me a bright mood in winter, and has soft hand feel. If it can be longer, it will be better."
"My toddler loves these shoes. Very lightweight and easy to get on/off. These were a replacement pair for a smaller size. Just be aware, though, that they seem to scuff really easily at the toe. In under a week the toes are scuffed and showing white fabric underneath. Also, the part of the shoe that goes around the ankle cinches a little, and always leaves lines around my kid's ankles. It doesn't seem to bother her in the slightest, as she screams bloody murder if I ever try to take them off of her."
MY livein boyfreind loved it so much
Have always loved these!
"The dress is amazing, the quality is awesome. However it's too big so I had to return it. I have not receive my return yet. It's over 21/2 weeks now"
I love this cap but I have a large head and it didn't fit. I had to use my sewing skills to alter it to fit. I have this problem a lot. I had to alter all the caps I ordered due to chemo and hair loss. I guess since most are made in third world countries they don't think about making them adjustable!
"This was such great purchase the type of shoe you definitely get notice . The gold just works with everything, skirt, leggings, etc you feel like walking on air. So comfortable ."
We won third place
"I absolutely love this dress! A large fits me perfectly, I'm a size 10.  The color is vibrant, it looks great and there is a feminine shoulder detail.  This could easily be dressed up or down.  Love"
I love it and want more!! It's a bit transparent but I just wear a camisole or  teddy under it.
"The pants are very fashionable and comfortable, I would highly recommend these pants over others, the fit is very flattering and material is very nice."
"My 4 year old loves his costume. So for ya, the small size fit well"
"Comfortable, nice quality. Doesn't shrink too much in the wash. Otherwise a nice clean cut shirt"
Purchased these as a gift.  The recipient loved them.  Looked exactly like the picture and looked good one.  Arrived packaged securely with no broken parts.
This purchase is a good one. The purse is roomy but long. I like the texture of the bag. I want every color.
So cute and for heels they are surprisingly comfortable. I get complements all the time. I definitely recommend these shoes.
"the watch is very nice and I particularly like the ease with which the band length can be adjusted. It would get 5 stars except there was no documentation with it saying it is water resistant. Amazon advertised it as water resistant to ~100 feet, but I am afraid to use it in water since no confirming documentation came with the watch."
"I conduct day long workshops.  I did buy the 3-6"" wood shoe stretchers for these shoes, which makes them tolerable all day."
"These shoes are comfortable, sturdy and stylish."
I listened to the reviews that it ran small and ordered a xl its a tent on me I should have ordered a medium or small if it fit it would be cute
"Santa Claus brought these to us for Christmas.  We put in a pool and hot tub this year and, as the weather cooled, found that it was a bit chilly when we got out of the nice warm water on a cool/cold evening.  These robes are perfect!  We don't bother with towels, we just pop these on as soon as we get out of the water!  The terry is plenty absorbent and soft.  The robes keep us toasty warm - so much so that on chilly mornings I use one as a ""jacket"" when taking the dog out for his first morning walk!"
Very comfortable as most Sketchers that I have and I do have many. If you're looking for an all around versatile shoe I would recommend this one.
"very comfortable, I recommend them."
"Wife loves them, Thanx"
Beautiful ring for my 17 year daughter
beautiful Thank you
I received this as a Christmas gift.  The small size is very roomy inside and works perfectly for going to the gym.
These are the most comfortable leggings to ever touch my legs! I absolutely love them. I wear a size 16 in Women's pants & these fit fantastic! Amazing quality for the price.
"This shawl/scarf is gorgeous!  It's substantial without being too heavy.  It'll go with lots of colors; my fall/winter wardrobe is heavy on gray and taupe and this piece looks great with both.  It's big, and can be worn several ways; loosely knotted as a scarf, as a shawl or thrown around the shoulders, pashmina style.  It'll be great to travel with on airplanes when you want a bit of extra warmth, and will update an old coat very Inexpensively."
"These boots are cute & as pictured.. Nothing is wrong with the way they look, however, i just received them and damn they smelled right through the box! They smell like they were on fire. Very odd smell and its very potent. I sprayed them with my boyfriends cologne and put them outside with the zippers down to air them out. Also, do NOT listen to people about the way they fit. They are not tight at all and i have normal, average feet. I'm an 8 or an 8.5 and i ordered a 9 because of previous reviews. I should have went down a size to what i actually wear. They are true to size and true to picture. Cute boots, terrible smell.. The delivery guy was probably a little tripped out."
Got two of these. One as a gift. Great looking!!!!
Can't wait to slip my feet in these and start using them. Will have to get some fabric protection to keep it clean and shiny.
"2 years later, still in great condition. 10/10 would buy and recommend again."
"Everybody loves this onesie it was awesome taking him home from the hospital in it. He's so cute!! It definitely runs a little big, but I'm not complaining because he'll fit into it longer!"
Completely served its purpose. Our little cat dancers were a big hit with the audience. Really made Stray Cat Strut rock!
Very comfortable. Easy on and off.
"I bought this cause I just wanted another everyday watch I could wear that could keep good time. I went with Seiko cause I already have 4 of them, and all of them are amazing. Probably my favorite watch company that exists. Overall for the price this watch is awesome! and I love the fact that it's automatic and requires 0 batteries. Just Awesome for an everyday time piece!"
thanks again for the order the dress is amazing and it was delivered very fast
It is nice but no soft
"Clarks shoes never hurt my feet. Alway comfortable. I always choose these shoes, I don't like breaking in a pair of shoes, never works for me."
Love these shirts. Really good quality and fit as expected. I'm usually a medium and this shirt fit just right. I've ordered two moe and expect to order more.
THEY ARE OKAY BUT DICKIES HEAVY WEIGHT TSHIRTS ARE BETTER QUALITY!
"I ordered the khaki in size 8. I wear 7 or 7.5 flats or heeled sandals. But I have wide duck feet so I have to do 8 in pumps, boots and other closed toe heels. These have adjustable straps with three settings - the middle setting works for me.

Nice, professional packaging, FREE foot pads, nevwr seen this type, they are squishy gel and seem ok, but they take up.toe room and I feel over the hours it might be a problem. I prefer pads on the bottom of the shoe so I have all the toe room for, IDK... toes!

The toe vamp is not really thin like the photo. They vamp is kinda chubby and not thin like the ""red bottoms"". The toes also ppint upwards a bit and don't lie flat on the floor. But I find this helps balance you off the balls of your feet and more onto your heels.

Overall for the.price and they'll be instantly comfortable, I'll keep them. I also got black patent and the snakeskin. Sizing/quality consistent."
They are comfor5table for work but they did take a little breaking in because the  leather was a bit stiff.
"Smaller than I expected, but overall beautiful!"
The ring is nice my son loved it. Fit perfectly.
"I was very wary of buying Jewelry online, however, I could not have been more pleased with the final result.  The Pearls are perfectly matched in size, they are probably closer to the 7.5 mm than 8.0 mm but they excellent quality.  I was afraid of the Saltwater pearls having too much rose or yellow in them, these are a great white, with very good sheen, and very good color.  I just ordered them, and then when to a few local Jewelry stores to try and shop for comparison to make my self feel better.  The Mikimoto ones at national retailers, where listed at $2,700 for a similar set.  I visited three local chain stores and only one even carried something as large as 7.5 - 8.0.  But after seeing the ones in stores, the ones I bought were easily the equal of anything I saw in the store.  I gave them to the wife for our anniversary and she is stunned by them.  I highly recommend The Pearl Source, and if I ever need something pearl in the future, they will be my go to source."
"I love this shirt as long as the buyer understands  they run small.  I read the reviews and instead of ordering a medium like I normally would, I ordered an XL.  It fit me perfectly!!  It is a lightweight fabric, perfect for summer."
"Fit  perfectly. We are durable, right height, right in style"
"Very comfy, I stand 9 hours at work with these pumps. I also insert the Petal cushions that are elongated to absorb the shock on the ball of my feet. Its ridiculously, super comfy! I love it!!"
This thing is crazy cute.  My 2 year old can wear it even my teenager can wear it (& does!) it's just a fun hat and my son is obsessed with hats.
"If you're familiar with the misery of having to be in a building that is brightly lit with overhead fluorescent fixtures while having a migraine... consider giving this a try. Youll be amazed at the relief it provides from those lights. Being super lightweight and adjustable, it also won't aggravate your headache with weight or tightness. Sometimes you have to explain to people why you're wearing a visor inside. Its totally worth the minor annoyance/embarrassment :)"
"Terrific value for the money but we had to return for a size larger.  As always, the return was fast and easy."
"This suit is absolutely breathtaking.  I own several Trina Turk swimsuits.  Yes, they're expensive, but believe me they're worth it.  They last for years and years without fading or stretching.  The pattern and fit of this suit was the best of any T.Turk one pieces I've tried.  I'm 5'9 with long legs and a short waist and typically wear a size 6 or 8 in small suits.  Trina Turk suits usually run a size small so I went with size 8, which was perfect.  My chest is a small 34B and this suit made me look much larger than that.  The back was beautiful and the bottom of the back was sexy but not too revealing (and I do have a booty!). The reason this suit gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the gold buckle in the front.  It's VERY shiny and thick - it cheapens the suit to me.  I didn't notice it in the picture, but its very obvious when you put the suit on.  That being said, if you like bling and gold metal on your suit, you'll love this one.  I toyed with the idea of keeping it and having someone redo the chest buckle - thats how much I loved the suit.  In the end, I decided that a suit this expensive should be perfect.  Unfortunately, this one wasn't to me."
"I Actually wanted a bracelet, especially bangle bracelet storage and display box. This is perfect!! Would also be perfect for men's watches as originally intended. The formed pieces are easy to remove for bangles, and I use them for flexible gemstone bracelets. I love the sturdy glass top; however, I place a piece of silver anti tarnish cloth across the top of box. I have purchased other storage boxes for bracelets before, but NONE compared to this item of quality, versatility, beauty, and price. Delivery was also fast --TWO Days.  THIS WAS A WONDERFUL PURCHASE ..THANK YOU!"
Love this sport coat
Just what I wanted for an everyday grab and go.
"These shoes are made wonderfully, fit perfectly on my (wide) feet, are light and breathable and mostly help me use my entire foot heal to toe because of the flexibility in the sole. I have tried many kinds of different running shoes and have never been satisfied until now. Everyone has their own opinion and are entitled to it but for those with wide feet that are scared away by some of the reviews, I can tell you that these are the most comfy running shoes I have ever put on my size 5 1/2 wide feet."
Hurts my feet wayyy too much :(
"The sleeves are a bit long but he has plenty of room to wear a sweater under the jacket.  This is a very lightweight jacket, perfect for spring/summer showers and if its a little chilly he can wear a sweater or sweatshirt under it."
Just as described. Excellent.
my son loves it. It is his new favorite shirt.
"Had to return them, I bought medium, probably should have bought small or even extra small"
Easy to wear out and get dirty but it's very comfortable
I'm very happy with this shirt. Big Bang Theory is a favorite of mine!
I was looking for a plain pair of heels to wear with jeans. They are exactly that. They are so comfy and nice looking that I wear them for work too.  I have had several pairs of Clarks shoes and I have never been disappointed.
"Great-looking quality watch that is strikingly attractive, user-friendly, and easy to read. It looks ultra-hip and stylish and right for all ages. If you decide to get this, you won't be disappointed."
fit nicely and the stretch add more comfort and movement.  When washed they did not shrink or fade
Fits my newborn. They started to get a little tight around 7.5-8lbs so we bumped her up a size. Great price for what you get.
"This is the best purchase I've made since I've been pregnant! This dress can be worn for many different occasions and looks great on! It fits as expected, with lots of room to grow. It is very comfortable, hugs in all the right places, and great length."
"These shoes make me feel like I'm on the show ""Mad Men"". I had to take them to a shoe repair shop so they can stretch the shoe which I have never had to get done for any of my shoes before. These are definitely narrow and not the most comfortable heel but they are very stylish. They are closer to a muted dandelion yellow instead of like a creamy linen color."
Thanks! My son will actually wear underwear now. Finally.
"I've worn Altra Torin 2.0 before and found them comfortable as I have osteoarthritis in my feet (bone on bone) as well as two neuromas on each foot.
I need to wear an orthodic and remove the Altra inner sole about 6 mos. into the wear cycle."
they fit well  and very comfortable
I bought it to wear with leggings but it's long enough that I wore it with tights and boots. The front came to just a bit above my knee
Perfect for my feet.
I advise a size over. My son wears a size 14 and next time I will order a size 16.
"Great socks. Only brand I buy now. No more Swiftwick, Wigwam, etc. I just bought about 6 more pairs of DT socks to augment what I already have."
"Price,warmth and comfort"
"This stylish, contemporary leather clutch wallet is perfect for the woman on the go - it will hold your phone, credit cards money, checkbook, etc.- with the dividers, it is easy to keep organized.  It works great as a wallet in your purse, or as a clutch on it's own.  I like that I can carry it my handbag or tote to work, and then when I want to run out to grab lunch or coffee, I can just pull out the wallet and run my errands; and I will have all of my essentials with me.  It's also great to carry on weekends, while you run your errands or go to the health club.  With the wrist strap andt zip closure, it is very secure.  I did receive this wallet at a discount, in exchange for writing a review."
very cute and affordable sunglasses! I always get compliments when I wear these
Very cute for an amazon purchase. Material is thick and not see through. Accentuates curves while hiding anything you don't want to see.
Wish it was a smaller size but i like the hat over all.
I love these and I think I will be ordering another set. They fit so perfectly and feel like they hold your tummy in a bit. They also look cute so you dont' feel like you are wearing big old underwear. The colors are bright and bold. They wash well and seem to be holding up. Very well made.
"I love these sandals.  Fit is perfect, very comfortable.  People stop me and ask me where I got them and what brand they are.  Very fashionable.
I have all colors!"
Loved the slippers but returned as they were an unappreciated gift.
Just as promised but I found it a little too sheer to use as a jacket to hide bare arms. Very pretty will wear as accent over a long sleeve shirt or dress.
Love the colors! Easy to put over some onesies and go for the day.  Perfect colors that will match different onsies.
Very nice. A little too big.
Totally worth the buy. I love the size and feel of this clutch. It's functional and matches everything. The strap is the perfect length too. Definitely go with this one if you're looking for a silver clutch.
"Good shirt. I live at hell valley Oklahoma near Ramona cotton does Not last more that a few weeks here, Polyester Is the only thing that survives here and unlike some of the other Polyester clothing It does Not smell or Itch, Its a little too small to get You hands to the arm pits to check for ticks but other than that Its a good shirt."
"Ordered this brand before so knew to order a 9 1/2 instead of a 10, because they tend to stretch a little which make them so super comfy! LOVE my Sperry's! Cute and comfortable...win win!"
"These scrub pants are the only ones I wear now. Being a pear shaped person, I did not find scrubs to be flattering or overly comfortable. These are very comfortable and fit really well. Hold up pretty well and are well worth the price."
"Simply fabulous!  Nice thick stockings like they had in the old days, great quality, no snags after playing in them, and super warm!"
I love the tunic. Fits great. Washes up perfectly.
"Love, love my sanuks! They fit perfectly, like all the others. Comfortable and pretty. Not as absorbent as the yoga mat so great for the beach! As always, sanuk delivers!"
Well made and comfortable but expensive and ugly.
Love love love them once I got them on right. One strap over arch one strap between toes and behind heel. Great for gifts too. Have then on now in fact
"Very light, comfortable shoes.  Not crazy about the iguana green.  This is my third pair of Paricia II.  I wish Crocs would come up with a different sandal style while using the exact same sole."
Excelente Muy Bueno
Got it on sale.  It's just like my old one that I have been using for years.
Love the cardigan. Looks good with pencil skirts as well as pants.
I bought it for my daughter. She loves it. Good quality.
"I love this watch.  I put it on when I received it last week and I haven't worn any other, and I have plenty.  I'm an old fart, so the big numbers help, and the clarity of the face is a plus.  Even though is a big watch, it fits on the wrist rather comfortably.  The only minus I have, and it's a minor one, is that the dates should have been numbered in increments of 5 instead of 10; you can't tell the date at first glance especially if it is between 10 and 20 and 31.  Otherwise, great watch, and great price."
Beautiful shoes! I love them!!
I love them!!  Great quality and fit just right.
Although they were a little to small . They fit my other son . They are awesome  sturdy made and durable. He wore them out last night to eat with the family .
Just perfect for jewelry and other things you want to sort. The plastic in this case is first quality and I recommend this to everyone who likes good containers.
"Elegant, i will purchase another color"
Love the fit.. Gorgeous
Fantastic polarized sunglasses at a great price.
My kid really liked. Are confortable
These where very nice...I ordered a 9N and the fit was perfect. I wore these to a wedding and had them on for several hours. I did add a small gel pad as they are pretty hard to stand in for long periods and could use a little cushion! Color was also perfect for what I needed.
"This dress fits exactly as I expected it to. I'm 5'3, 123 lbs with some curves and the medium fits perfect. I think size small would have been too small for me. The size medium is snug, it hugs my body and fits great.  It's feminine, figure flattering. I like it."
"Favorite slippers of all time. I wear them to death, literally putting holes in the bottom. But its ok, I throw em in the wash and wear em hard around the house. Get around 6m lifespan then order a new pair. Im size 7 and order medium."
Kept my feet nice and toasty.
Very nice package of colors!
Deducting one star for awkward seam across lower belly
"501 Original Levi's are classic and always a great value. Lighter washes tend to run small, might want to check fit locally prior to online orders."
"I wear a dress size of 14 to 16 with 36 DDD boobs. Costumes never fit me when I go try them in store and I usually have to buy a size up from what I am. I purchased the XL and it fits great. It is very stretchy so I feel it could accommodate someone a little larger, covered my breasts well and was a great length for me. I am 5'4. The fabric is nice and the XL would probably still look good on a person size 12 as well. Over all I loved it."
"They are generous for 34's, but probably best since they are used for gardening and tight would be bad.  The 30"" seam is really 30 so a little long for me as I would have preferred 29 or 28.  However they are great and I really find them very comfortable,"
"Damn creepy... My wife threw it away cus it creeped her out too much, and I loved every minute of it."
great bikini!  love the pattern.  the top is a bit opened...not enough coverage for big boobs.
"Shorts fit great, great quality. really like the pinstripe look!"
"Love these! Minimal color fade, soft and comfortable!"
"Nice light floppy hat. A bit on the large size for me, apparently I have a very small head ."
"This seems like a decent quality bra. It has lace over the cups with three pleats underneath. I could do without that, because it's already got the texture of the lace, but unless you're wearing something very clingy, you won't notice the seams. It definitely provides a size increase, both in terms of upward push for cleavage and outward. It gives a somewhat teardrop shape, looking at the front, rather than round, because of the plunge, so it would be good for deep v-necks. It's a little too padded for my taste and I prefer the rounder look, but your mileage may vary. It's a good bra at a good price."
"Thin, but I love how comfortable it is. It also has a heel grip that help keep the sock in place!"
Sooo comfortable.  I've converted from a Brooks fan to Saucony.  Nice wide toe bed.  I did buy 1/2 size larger because I like a lot of room.
"love this bag, works great holds a lot"
"I love these beautiful, sparkly earrings.  Swarovski is the best crystal element.  I also have the matching necklace whick I like equally as well.."
"It's good. The material is a little thin but nothing crazy. Just not 5 star quality.
Don't wear this thing near a Capt. America movie release date..  unless you want to talk about it non stop. Lol.
Chick's dig it ;)"
"I wear 31x34 and jeans that actually fit and don't bag in wierd places are hard to find. I ordered the levi relaxed fit and the silver tabs to see which ones fit better.  The silver Tabs won hands down.  I will definately be ordering more of these.
UPDATE Nov,2011. I still like these jeans but Now I have found the Lee Premium Relaxed. Again it's hard to find jeans to fit these skinny man hips and my no-ass-at-all disease and the Lee's fit even better with less bagging without being too tight...

UPDATE 2: Well I've gone back to the Levis. 527 low rise boot cut. An even better fit on my skinny a**"
"I bought this dress in two colors- the nude and olive and so far, I love them! Super soft, stretchy, and comfortable and really great as a transition from work (just throw on a blazer or sweater) to fun dress! I am 5'8"" and it is a true midi dress on me. The only drawback is the rather thin material. Definitely make sure you have a good tee shirt bra to wear with!"
Comfortable and relaxed fit. Excellent for working out.
"Fits pretty well. Good for the price. I wear a 32DD but that size wasn't available, so I purchased a 34D. No gaping. Band is a bit loose, but that's because I'm used to a 32."
"Absolutely love this watch.  I bought two different styles.  I have received quite a few compliments!

UPDATE:  Still love thos watch.  The battery just went dead, but that's all.  I wear this watch everyday and I work in a factory.  I always get complimented on it and no one else has one!  Absolutely love it!"
I like the shoe. It really look nice and the size was perfect. The only thing I didn't like was that it wasn't very warm like my others tennis shoes.
Pretty skirt. I knew from previous experiences to always order next size up
"I have only played one round with these shoes so far, but they are extremely comfortable. I got these to compliment a pair of Adidas golf shoes that I already own. I cant remember the model off the top of my head, but they are the mesh material ones. They are great unless it is wet out. That is where these come in. I wanted some solid leather shoes to help keep my feet dry. They are a little heavier then I thought that they would be, but still very lite for solid leather shoes. Over all they did very well, however they seemed to be more prone to clogging up with grass then my other Adidas shoes. I am happy with them."
"Great, wore a hem under my wedding dress when they became sore."
"i am trying to grow my closet and shoes collection. I bought this shoes for work and so far is one of the best investments i have made. i wasn't sure how it would fit , but when i got it and tried it on it fit as expected. if you are going to buy this shoe, please go true to size."
Just wish they came in a 2 pack.
Bought these after being disappointed by the Rigid Dragon pair. Fit much more snugly and the colors are nicely faded.
Excellent Product look forward to using it soon.
"Dam these shoes are comfortable. First time I wore them out.  I had them on for hours standing.  No pain,  no redness to my feet and they didn't stretch out.  I'm getting a blue pair soon."
"A little more form fitting than I wanted, but these jeans are comfortable true to size and no gap when I sit down."
Bought for my husband. He said belt loops were to high up which he did not. Other then that he satisfied. Very comfy but he wished it was little longer.
"I just didn't care for these shoes.
I think they would be good for the rain, but I live in Southern Calif. and we rarely get rain! :("
These are really cute and fit my small child well. Unfortunately she doesn't like them as well as some of her other ones that have characters.
My Daughter Loves Sweater But Even Though We Purchased XXX-Large Size It Fits Very Snug.
Great shoe!!  Was a little loose so I sent back and got a smaller size and they were perfect.
"Lightweight, comfortable. They aren't super supportive but they get the job done. I don't run in them but I walk a lot in them and I have no complaints."
Replacing a pair I wore almost every day for 6 years. Love them
"You have shopped for the perfect nursing bra.  You are frustrated.  You want one that allows easy access for feeding baby, pumping when you go back to work, but at the same time gives you at least a little shape since you have always worn moulded bras in the past.  THIS IS THE BRA FOR YOU.  Seriously, stop shopping around and buy this one - it's worth the extra money.  I was a 32B before baby, 34C during pregnancy and now fluctuate between a 34C and 34D (mostly 34C) during breastfeeding and the Medium is the perfect size for me.  It actually gives a nice shape under clothes and I couldn't love it more.  And let me tell you - I think I tried every bra there is.  This is THE ONE."
"Very nice looking and appears to be pretty sturdy and won't break with wear, but it is easy enough to cut pieces off if you want to adjust size."
It's sturdy and stylish.  A great belt!
Great color quality. Has lasted through several washes without fading or shrinking
"Really nice coat.  Fits well.  A little bulky, but what is expected due to the detachable vest."
Just what I asked for
impressed with the quality. will use this week to museum. let you know. pockets all over and it doesn't stink! some 'leathers' stink! yuk!
"Good quality, fits as pictured"
Good quality. I was pleased to have a T-shirt with the slogan available so quickly
"Great running socks, I really like the banding around the middle of the foot"
"I love Vanity Fair Women's bras! Illumination is my favorite style, but I couldn't find this color in that style. This one fits just as great!"
"I really love this dress. It is so comfortable and cute.
I am 5'11, 160lb and the medium fits great. I do wish it was a little longer (it comes to just above mid thigh on me), but that is a fairly common problem I have with dresses.
The only other thing that annoys me is calling it reversible. I believe what they mean is that it can be reversed front to back - which in my opinion looks strange. It is not reversible inside out."
"great jacket,  washes well"
These fit great and the soles make them very comfortable.  I walk every day and these are the most comfortable boots I have found.  Highly recommend them.
"Snug fit, durable materials, great company and warranty - I really enjoy the closure, simple yet robust"
love this movie and this shirt. shirt is slightly fitted
"I loved this, but my grandson did not look as good in it as I had hoped.  The length comes below the knee - knickers - and on a pudgy baby it looks terrible.  Wish it was a few inches longer."
Watch is awesome and is a great looking watch. It comes perfect in a nice gift box. I like the fact that the adjustable crown is pulled out so the battery is not being used until you press it in. Also the strap is very stiff but is a nice leather so it needs to be worked a little so that it will be comfortable. The watch works great and it looks even Better.
Great shoes. Look great.
"This was as beautiful as it was online!! My sister loved it,and now i want one!! lol!! Fast shipping!!"
"Cute scarf, exactly like it looks....but did have a very weird smell out of the packaging! lol"
I got this as a gift for 2.99 and I am amazed at how great it is. On first look I thought it might be a little small for a wrist but it slides on nicely and isn't too tight at all. It looks like it should have cost a lot more. I am also pleased that there was a stopper in place so that the battery wasn't be drained.
Awesome shoes. I want every color!!  So comfortable you can wear 24 hours a day. Like walking on a cloud!!
Fit was as good as it gets.
"Loveeee these! They fit great-maybe a tad big, but in a good way (like oh this is my usual size but it's super comfy!). I love that the leather in front makes them chic, but the back is super comfy and won't get scratched on chairs, stools, benches, etc.

Love, love, love and looks great with a white or black tee and heels!"
I love carters! Soft and cute.
"Yay! It's so soft and better than expected.  I got a large but am usually a medium and sometimes a small.  Have you ever ordered a shirt from a fundraiser or team sport? The shirts are unisex and this x large is equivalent to a small in those generic shirts,hope that helps."
It's a nice little lock. It's easy to set up the code and is very convenient.
Good quality and great for BFF.
"We frequently purchase Stride Rite shoes, because they are one of the few brands that offer truly wide shoes that fit my Fred Flinstone-footed son. After a couple of recent purchases from Stride Rite that were not side enough, these Christopher shoes are back on track. They go on easily and fit like a dream. I also love that these come with velcro straps instead of laces or elastic, which is harder to find in the larger little kid sizes.

Bonus: he loves the brightly colored shoes, but they're still subdued enough to wear with everything."
"Beautiful, strong to hold my heavy pendant. I love the feel of the necklace, It is not heavy feeling, comfortable.... I am so pleased with how it shines. I So appreciate the instructions that were enclosed for maintenance on how to clean and care for the necklace. Also, enclosed were anti-tarnish strips and extra earring backs, which the backs are the good ones!  The little extras was very thoughtful and much appreciated. I look forward to see what other items they have for future purchases."
"I love this little dainty ring. Its perfect for me. I am a sports momma and this does not get in the way at all. It is light and you cannot tell you have it on at all. This arrived in an adorable box that is worthy of gift giving. I love the rose gold color. Also super fast shipping. I receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."
"Love, love this shoe.  Very hard to find now that new ""version"" has come out."
"I love the stripe on these. They are really cute on my son (for Crocs, which in my opinion are the ugliest shoes ever made). Great for the pool and puddle stomping."
Absolutely love these shoes for my little girl!!!!
The product  Luxehome women's leather Rabbit Fur bootie itself is wonderful. It's small for me because I have a very high arch and I can't get my feet into them. Reluctantly I have to send then back.
Love this robe - very soft yet the fabric holds it shape well.
"Comfortable, really cute shoe!"
"Fits true to size - even after 2 washes in cold water.
Very tough, very warm pants."
"A new favorite bra, very comfortable. I will buy again."
I bought these for my Hamburglar costume for Halloween. I put together a last minute costume and wore a black and white striped dress with these socks. I wish I could find a reason to wear them again because they're comfy and they're cute.
amazing shoes!
"Other than this butterfly doesn't have as much purple as it shows here, I like it...The center of this butterfly is too light almost white.
You can see the difference when I hold it up to this one showing on line."
"This is a pretty good hat, Bill and center of hat are a little off. Other than that it's a nice hat."
"I'd buy them again.  Only complaint is that shoes weren't packaged in an outside box but in original Oshkosh shoe box and it was completely crushed, exposing the shoes inside.  Thankfully, the shoes were okay."
"Nice blazer, for work or casual."
Love them. I will order more soon
only problem is... the elastic stretches out just like my other flexfit cap. Material design flaw.
Purchased these for a friend as a gift after she admired mine which I wear all the time.
Ninewest is always my go to shoe. This is the second pair I've purchased. My only gripe is when you walk there is a little bend where your bunion is.. which over time tears at the shoe.. so the insides become out... I keep purchasing these because of the price point as well as knowing the fit of the shoe...
"My son is a tall thin 8 year old. He is 51 inches tall and weighs 50 lbs. Clothes/underwear shopping can be a challenge for me. Not only is he tall and slim, but he is very sensitive to certain types of fabric. I came across these underwear, read how wonderful the fabric is supposed to be, so I thought I'd buy a pair to see what my son thinks.  He loves them. Said, they are the most comfortable pair of undies he has worn. He wants me to buy him more. HIS ONLY complaint is they are a bit big in the waist, and I bought him a 5/6! I wish they would make the waist a bit slimmer for those skinny kids out there. Other than that he's happy with them."
"awesome product, love the authentic look of real gold, proud to wear it with my mom's cross that is 14k gold, she recently passed and the chain she had was too tight on my neck. This one is so real looking and i am so happy with the warranty and the product itself..... Looks amazing like real gold. thank you for offering such a unique product. :) very happy with it....."
"Got my suit and dress things to a wedding with almost no wrinkling at all, despite some rushed abuse getting through three airports!  Perfect for a suit, shoes, and clothes for a weekend.  Very pleased!"
I read the reviews that said they ran about a half size too big.  I bought a half size down and they fit perfectly.
"Comfortable, Beautiful & Sexy"
"I went to a store to try on bras and was unable to find anything that I liked as well as this bra.  The extra side piece makes it work for me, and the seamless wire-free cup makes it very smooth and comfortable."
My wife loves her flats! Perfect!!!
"Members Only is such high quality!  The red color looks great on someone with either winter or autumn coloring!!!  Terrific price, too."
"The product was not used yet.
 The product had been satisfied with the quality and design."
"Has been a staple of my daughters wardrobe since 18 months.  LOVE this jacket, but seems to be lighter weight than in the past... not quite as happy this time. This is a spring/fall jacket for sure.  Step the game back up Columbia.  Just the right weight for car rides in the winter, and playing outside spring and fall, and cold Michigan nights, like July 4!  LOVE it!"
"I'm normally a medium and based on reviews I ordered a large, but I should have ordered an x-large.  But other than the size, the color and style are great."
"Great, inexpensive leggings. My only concern is that after a few washes they're beginning to look worn."
Beautifull very delicate is really nice for a gift
Most comfortable form fitting slide sandal I've owned. Deffinatly going to order a couple more pairs!! UA is has really gotten on point with their shoe and sandals line from where they came from a few years back..
Love this shoe. Great buy.  True to size. Came right on time. Comfortable throughout my 5k walk
Exact shade of red I was looking for
"I bought these earings for my girlfriend and she loved them. The color is as appears in the picture. She says they are comfortable and not too heavy, and she mostly wears them to formal outings."
"This scarf actually exceeded my expectations. It was super thick and has a great weight to it and matched the product photo well. Unfortunately it was SO warm I'll need to save it for freezing days only versus casual cool days/nights, but I know it will become a winter staple."
"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, she loved it and said it is a good fit and very comfortable too!"
I returned these shoes because the colors were different than in the picture and I did not care for the actual look once i received them. But that is to be expected when using a computer image. I never wore them so i really cannot answer the other questions provided in this review.
quedaorn perfect
worked great with my dress...
Thick and comfortable. The size fit perfectly. It washes well.
Very nice and comfortable shirt - casual without being dowdy.
I am in love with this ring great quality
511 is the best product that you can buy all my years of law enforcement is 5 11
Is more that what I expect!
Just what I was looking for. Comfortable for exercising.
Really pretty.  Nice size.  Shows off the markings very clearly.
"So impressed with this necklace.  After seeing an anchor necklace on another site for significantly more money, I searched around on Amazon and found this item.  It arrived weeks ahead of schedule and the seller included an extra chain.  Really impressed with the detail, quality and weight of this necklace.  Great conversation piece!  Love it."
Best wallet ever and it matched my purse.
Cute glasses although they break very easily.
So comfy even for first time wear. Love the rugged used look! Great buy!
"Very good hand made, good fit, and great quality! Good for the professional work!"
Gorgeous Booties!  I love the color. Very subtle and versatile. Comfortable too!  These are keepers!!
zipper are cosmetic
"This charm is made great. My kids nana will love this for xmas. Fits right on the bracelet we got for her with the other one we ordered also. We love it. Great product. will be ordering more

Looked amazing on my husband and matched my garnet dress perfectly!
Love the shirt good quality
"The picture just doesn't do it justice. These earrings are gorgeous, they look like they are way more expensive; I am a jewelry fan just not to say addict, I have seen a lot of jewelry out there and I just can't believe I only paid 20 bucks for these. The Amethysts are of a deep purple color and are very clear I can't see any inclusions. The leverback works just fine and they look so elegant when you put them on. These earrings were the reason why I decided to try more pieces from the Amazon Collection; I now own at least five pieces and I'm very happy with all of them and will be getting more in the future for sure. The price is just unbelievable and I'm planning to get a couple more to give as gifts. Order these you will not regret it. Anyways if you don't like them, Amazon has one of the best return policies out there. Good luck!"
"I love the shoe, and have many compliments. My only complaint is that they are a tad wider than I expected. The shoes are true to color and are comfortable for all day wear."
nice....good quality
"Kinda runs a little big, but still love the shirt. Would definitely buy it again. The quality is awesome and material feels great"
Slightly tight & a little hard to get on. But a good quality sturdy shoe for an active boy.
A birthday gift for a friend......This has class and made quite well........I was proud to give it to my friend.
Ok so i ordered a large due to me putting on weight...but im this came alot bigger than i anticipated. So im going to order another one in medium. I have to give this 5 stars because it feels awesome!! The fabric is very soft...it looks awesome on my boyfriend. (yes he knows its a female shirt...he doesnt care lol)
Great for our vacation
Great underwear. LOL. Does the job.
My 2yo will love these shirts for his birthday next week!
Love the top and fits nice. The blue color is perfect.
"the material is great, but after washing it, its clingy and has lots of lint on it"
"Terrific price.  The earrings are really quite nice, not too big and not too small.  I bought it for myself and am very happy with it."
"Love love love this!! She's worn this about 6 times in the last 2 months. It holds its shape and color nicely and is of good quality, plus she's adorable in it!!"
"Personally I think these are better than Hanes A-shirts. Theyre Actually hemmed at the bottom so they don't ripple. And they seem to hold up better in the wash. And they seem a little thicker too, Better quality. I think I'll be buying these from now on."
"One heck of a value....... Everybody on my xmas list loved them, and thought I paid much more for them......"
I have the same type just different color and 6.5 fit great but for some reason the purple fit really small. I noticed that was mark that fit small but since I already owned Altra it would be fine. Please order one size up.
"I own seven Timex watches, and six other brands (Seiko, Fossil, Skagen, etc.); so I'm a watch geek. This is one of the better Timex watches I have because of the unique design and day/date feature. The silicone band is better than leather (for me) because it's waterproof and doesn't stain. I wear it to the gym (sweat proof) and the office, a night out, etc. It fits any occasion."
luv it.....great quality.....
"Bought as a gift for the nephew, mainly for the shirt. He loves it. True to size"
"Love this fluffies, came in sooo fast. Awesome customer service, so attentive and helpful with any questions I had. Such a good quality fur, I love it!!!. Anyways got gloves, fluffies and the LED tutu from there can't wait to put the outfit together with the rest of the stuff!!! Thank you soo much Emazing lights!!!"
its just the graphic printed on a hanes tshirt but it's not bad. glows in the dark.
Very nice.  Heavy-duty material used to make the product last longer.
"Great bra and very supportive (34D).  It's easy to switch to a racerback style which is nice.  Only issue is that the fabric is a little rough, especially on my shoulders, but that seems to be the case with all of the bras that are very supportive.  It would be nice if the shoulders could be lined with a softer fabric."
"Really cute, but I think they'll be quickly outgrown. Adorable while they last though."
Far exceeded my expectations- soft-fitted without being tight-color darker than picture but I still will keep it!
I bought these for a trip to Hawaii and got tons of compliments and questions about where we got these from.  Will definitely purchase another pair when the time comes - they are very comfortable as I have several Cushe sandals and shoes I've bought from the past so no regrets with this purchase!
I like it! Using it for work.
Loved them so light and comfortable
I love it.  Another perfect gift for a friend who has a Batman collection.
Bought these for a friend.  He likes them alot.  Fits great.
Love!  Not too thin.  I need every color.  Great price!  Washes well!
"I love Dan Post boots.  This is my second pair.  No need to break them in, they're comfortable from the beginning.  Well made, look great.  I'll definitely buy more!

They do run a little big, so I go down 1/2 size and they fit perfect."
"I also like the material they are made out of and
am thinking of getting another pair in a different color"
Nice but bigger than anticipated.
I used it for a costume. It wasn't the most comfortable belt but it was gorgeous
"This athletic shoe provides lots of cushioning and is perfect for holding an orthotic.  I personally like the neutral white/gray design, which avoids the garish colors of some of today's athletic shoes.  Feels wonderful!"
I bought these every summer for my kids when they were young. I loved them. They loved them. Now i'm buying them for my grandkids.
awesome gift for daughter
"Love these sneakers. Have 2 pairs.
Would purchase again."
This is a great product and would recommend to anyone-----bought my wife a second pair and a pair for my daughter in law.
What a beautiful necklace. Very pretty....even nicer in person. I got the large one for me and the smaller one for my daughter to wear on her first day of school so that we would match and she would know that I was thinking of her. Very happy with the purchase. Looks like a great quality sterling necklace.
Love this nice quality soft plaid scarf.
Good warm hat. Fits my husband's large head great
Bought these for the wife she loves them one of the most comfortable shoes she had including Nike Adidas
Just what I was looking for. Watch works great
"I have been wearing 501s and 505s for years and decades. Always fit the same, always look the same. SInce they've moved manufacturing to China, Egypt, etc. The stitches are uneven and the worst of it is the pockets. They are not the same depth! Some are halfway to the elbow and others only to the wrist!
Other than that, always the same, always great"
"I like this brand, it's my second Grace Karin petticoat. Nicely stitched and fits according to the size chart. Color is as expected for the red-violet, it is hot pinkish."
I loved the design and the subdued grey colors.  It looks great with black pants and pumps or flat shoes.  It fit perfect--true to size.
"I bought this ring for my husband due to the fact that his original one was getting super scuffed, and messed up. He works in a tire shop. He wears this one everyday, and it still looks brand new! He has had it since Christmas. :)"
"The hem is not even all the way around, it has a bit of a train, probably called a ""brush train"".  I should have checked the photos more carefully.. I fell in love with the dress so kept it, also, it is an easy fix as I can sew."
"i use them as undershirts or out and about, love hanes products.  FYI their premium cotton shirts in v neck are super super soft and comfortable also, just a bit more pricier but not too much."
The different compartments are useful to my needs!
don't know why people say the sizes are off ordered my right size and it was perfect.  love this belt with jeans.
"great deal ,nice looking, nice fitting,nice price,I got a great pair of sun glasses. I just have to remember where i put them .."
A beautiful charm that threaded right into the bracelet.  And promptly delivered when ordered at the beginning of December for Christmas.
"I hardly ever put 5 stars on any of my reviews.  Love is an awfully strong term for a material thing.  However, This is a very nice piece of jewelry, my Wife also likes it a lot.  Unfortunately, there was an issue with getting it on time so it DID NOT arrive in time for Mother's Day as promised, but rather the day after.  I was told it was an issue with UPS, but I personally think there was more to it.  Anyhow the moral of the story is that this is a very nice piece, but allow a couple of weeks to ensure it arrives as promised."
Very nice looking and so comfort
really comfortable and light
Much better looking in person and fits well!
Looked just like this pic ! Super cute and a great size !
Great value.  Wasn't sure how I would like this style of wallet.  Been a pleasant surprise so far.  Works great for me.
"Good quality shoe, but the straps rub by the ball of the foot.  Also, at the back of the heel the elastic rubs and it is uncomfortable."
Great comfy shorts!
"These are great. Look great and comfy. They came in pink,nude and black. I am very disappointed they changed the color selection. I hope they eventually bring back these basic flattering colors."
"Beautiful color, not to small, not to large just the right size for an adult or older teen. I trust Star K quality, have purchased from them before and will do so again. ( a little to big to be real ) But who cares they are PRETTY."
"This bag was the perfect size for travel.  It held my phone, credit card size wallet, and several other small items.  The only complaint I had was that it smelled weird when I first got it.  A dryer sheet placed inside took care of the smell."
Was very surprised by the quality and the material of this swimsuit! I absolutely love it. I usually wear a 10-12 in a swimsuit but purchased the x-large and it fits fine - not too big or too small. Very flattering on. I recommend this swimsuit very cute!
"I have not used it yet, but anticipate that it will work out nicely as it has the special feature of RFID blocking, which is the reason I purchased the wallet."
Love these sandals and wear them all summer long. Great sandals and I have a great collection of them!
Exactly as shown in the picture
Great feeling underwear. Good for exercising or for desk work.
"These are great shirts.  They can be worn for casual or semi-dress up.  They go perfect with a pair of khaki slacks.  I have bought several shirts during the last couple of years.  They are little pricey, but worth the extra little you have to spend.  Order a size up for adult because they are fitted which they need to put in their description.  I usually wear a medium, but order a large.  I put fit as expected because I knew that I needed to order the large size."
Gifts - we'll received
"I ordered these shorts in my normal size for all other brands and they were too small.  I ordered them one size larger and they fit fine, so at this price I ordered six more pairs.  Great deal.  Great quality."
My Husband and I have traveled the world with these pouches. Fantastic way to keep everything together and safe. I gave one to my neice who is going to Italy to take College courses. Not  sure if she understood the safety of this corny pouch. She'll learn she's just starting to travel 21 years old.
This flip flop is very comfortable. I ordered my regular size and it's a great fit.
"Feminine and good coverage, nice style, especially like the soft, chiffon sleeves . Gave as a gift, she loved it."
This ring really is stunning!  It sparkles like its the real thing.  My only issue is I wish it came smaller as I would love to wear it on my left hand.
"These were very cute, but they were too small. They do not have 1/2 sizes and I generally wear a size 8 with a rare occasion where I would wear size 8 1/2. Based on the price, I may have to try the size 9."
"It is a beautiful shoe; however, this style does fit a bit more snug than my other size 8 Keens.  I'm thinking because it's leather, so I'm hoping it will give with wear."
"Loved the fit. Stretched in all the right places
Sexy as heck"
"I have a slim body and I was afraid this was going to be baggy, or too short at the waist. It was rather perfect and will not need alterations. Thank you!"
"Great boots...love them.

Helena Paka"
They are very finely made  fits me as I expect are are very nice.
Perfect for my daughters play and she can wear them after! 5 stars! Beautiful shoes!
I have a short torso and this waist cincher fits much better than my underbust corsets. The mesh material is strong but comfortable for summer. The quality and price make it a great buy!
Very nice piece. A bit in big but still very pretty..
"Is beautiful and different, super cool and fashion"
Good socks though sometimes I forget that it is necessary to choose a pair of right and left))
"I read the reviews stating that this shoe runs a whole size small and also runs narrow.  I usually wear an 8 1/2 in a sneaker-type shoe and can ONLY wear them if they run narrow. Since I love the look and the price of this shoe, I ordered a 9 1/2 and held my breath. The shoes arrived very fast and they actually fit!  Any shorter and I couldn't wear them.  They are light and very comfy.  They are well padded in the heal and perhaps that's part of the reason it takes a larger size.  I am very pleased that I took a chance and placed the order! I love the shoes."
Have only worn it once but it seems fine for the price. Don't know if it will fade or shrink quickly yet.
"I bought this based on the good reviews, but I'm a little disappointed. While the material is very soft, it runs a little short and I suspect it will shrink in the wash."
Love this sgame skirt my granddaughter looks simply adorable
"Wow!  The photograph on Amazon does not reflect the sporty styling and impeccable craftsmanship of this hoody, which is really more of a parka.  Made of a quality breathable and water resistant gabardine type fabric, the torso and hoody are also lined with a soft and warm shell sherpa.  The sleeves' elasticized cuffs feature snaps that allow me to adjust the width to my wrist, making it much more comfortable to wear.  I also like the fact that it is not too tight around the torso and arm areas, so that I can layer the jacket over a sweater if needed during extremely cold temperatures.  In addition, it has roomy zippered side pockets to keep my gloves safely when not needed, as well as an inner pocket to keep my sunglasses.  (The latter 2 are not included.)  The hoodie has an elasticized drawstring, to adjust if desired to keep my ears warm during very cold days.  I am now set for the cold season ahead, rather it's dry, rainy, or snowy.  I HIGHLY recommend this sharp Tommy Hilfiger jacket."
For my husband. Super lightweight and flattering. Hes a 34x32 and the L fit perfectly.
Bangin!  Wife uses this all the time and is on her second one in about 5 years.
"I am very happy with these shoes. Both colors are rich and pretty. They are pull on, so keep that in mind. They fit just right and would probably be loose if not a bit longer to get on. So glad I got both cuz these will be worn!"
"I've bought a number of cheap corsets online and I have not say that this is the only one that did not give me any trouble! Not only is it really nice, but very true to the picture and description. The only complain I have is that the back lacing is black (nothing else on the corset is black) and it looks like a giant shoelace string. I can't complain for the price!"
Shopping from home for something you like and can't find in town. Perfect.
"I have worn this particular shoe before and it is very comfortable .  I wear it for gym workouts rather than  for running, so I can only vouch for comfort and fit."
"I was completely surprised by this swimsuit!!!!  It fits and it's actually pretty cool!!!!  The style is very interesting and good for a full figured gal without looking like a grandma suit.  Now, I am a size 18 in pants right now and this fits me.  I like to leave as much info to help others determine if the fit may work for them.  However, I'm plump but kinda small, if I lose 5 pounds I can fit a size 16.  Hope this helps a bit.  The material is thin and not binding which is a huge plus for me.  I hate a bathing suit that makes me feel like I'm wearing a girdle.  I can recommend this suit for it's quality and look.  For the price it's more than anyone can expect and as I said a very pleasant surprise.  It does have cups built in but you can remove them easily or keep them.  I feel a true size 16/18 can wear the size I ordered.  But that's it.  I love my new swimsuit :D"
"Fits a little larger than ""Jr. Fit"" and ""Stretch"" would imply, but all in all a great product!!
These are my new favorite work pants, I won't go back to the other brand I was using ever again. They are much more stretchy than other scrub materials that I typically see. Great for when you have to bend and stretch. Also, the pockets are WONDERFULLLLLL."
"I absolutely love these shoes!  I had been wearing my beloved Simple slip on shoes for a couple of years.  When I went to order another pair, I found they were out of business - at least for now.  So I was forced to find something else.  These shoes are even better because they have a little arch support.  They are easy to slip on, look great, and are very comfortable.  I ordered the gray ones first and then ordered the black ones.  Also worthy of mention is how lightweight they are.  They weigh next to nothing!"
"Gave this to my daughter for her 16th birthday.  Comes with a very nice chain, is a good weight, doesn't feel or look cheap.  In fact, she wears it more than the necklace her boyfriend gave her!  One she'll treasure for years to come"
"Stunning ring for the price! Im in the process of losing weight and needed a place holder ring until my wedding set can be sized, this ring is so pretty and is of very decent quality, and I honestly love it way more than I was expecting."
Perfect fit.  Love my fit flops. These are the only flip flops my foot doctor tells me to wear.
This dress looks fantastic. I love it. I wore it on a recent cruise and got many compliments.
I got a 3XL and it was a bit too small but I've been doing some weight loss it only took me a 2 months an a Half to fit into properly I say order it 2 or 3 sizes bigger to be comfortable. The lace and over all look of it is stunning i love it!
I ordered them a little bigger because I wanted to wear heavy socks in these.  They fit perfect.  Very comfortable.  I would purchase them again.
Person whom I gifted this to loved it. Nice overall but a little small. Good quality for price.
The size of this waist trainer is accurate and it fits great.
"I have been taking a liking to Cubavera after buying a pair of their casual drawstring slacks. When this went on sale for under twenty dollars, I pulled the trigger and bought one. They have a very stylish and chique look, like a Perry Ellis. The inseam are high up to give you that elegant and sophisticated look. The fabric is high-quality and very comfortable. Overall, I have no problems and only good things to say about these Cubavera's. Highly Recommended!"
"Great dress for the value. Wore it for a full day at work and lazing around on the couch for a few hours waiting for trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Have not washed it yet, but it held up well and did not stretch out after wearing all day. I am 36DDD on top and size 8 pants. I ordered the M/L size. It hugs the body, but is not skin tight, which was what I wanted. Wish it was printed on the back (I knew it wasn't when purchasing, but that would boost it to 5 stars)."
Keeps great time!
I like it. Good wuality for price
I really like it its like my dog was a part of me I treasure it my love for my dog his name is oreo
"Nice ankle socks. Material on the thin side, perfect for dress socks and sliding around on wood floors."
"I bought these for my sister's ""20's themed Birthday party,"" and they are perfect! Also, they are pretty comfy which is rare in super cute dress shoes. Also, they came very fast, which is awesome! Will be buying from this seller again! :)"
It's nice but is not very flattering on me. Great color. Maybe I can make it work. The sleeves are not as long as they look and are kind of poofy....
"I really like these! so soft it almost feel like there not there but still hold my package well... I bit pricey, they need to make a bulk deal!!!"
"Purchased as a gift to go with palm tree pendant from same jeweler...nice quality, nicely presented, promptly delivered...recipient was pleased."
"I've bought 2 pairs of Steve Madden shoes for my husand and my father. And both of them are very satisfyed with these boots. Perhaps, it is not perfect. Yes, you can find more comfortale shoes - but not for this price. I've bought them for $12-14! Leather boots! It is a little heavy - but just a little! It is not for real winter -15-20F your feet will be cold. But for the temperature of about 0-5 - in the car - it is perfect proposition!"
It's super cute. I had to return it because i needed a larger size and they didn't have it. Why i wrote somewhat small is because the top is small and cropped.
jeans are well made and hold up to every day rigors very well. It's good to know the size I need is available at Walmart.com as the short length for my stubby legs is hard to find in retail outlets.
"MY FAVORITE CARHARTT BELT! Own this in brown and black. Love, love, love!"
Great dress love it  If your on the fence order it can't go wrong looks great and feels great  Follow size chart
Great anklet. Love the style and everything about it.
Very pretty and the size for me is just right.
"This shocked me! I have been looking for earrings like this, but can never find them this affordable! $6 earrings... 3 pairs?! This is such a good deal! The earrings look as pictured! I wore one pair for a week straight and didn't lose any pieces. I highly recommend!"
This review is from what I have observed since these are for my wife. The build is quality. My wife has a wide foot so the straps needed to be oiled and stretched. She did get blisters the 1st time she wore them. They do require breaking in and from what Ive gathered may take a few months to do so with allowing the blistered to heal.
I like the earrings.  They are very sparkly but the gold is very thin so they tend to tip down and not hang straight up/down.  I find myself constantly adjusting them to hang straight to get most sparkle.
We ordered these as bridesmaid dresses - wow.  Best bridesmaid dress ever.  So flattering!
"I could not have asked for a more fitting dress for my graduation. I felt beautiful and classy while wearing this. I am 5'2 and 160lbs. I have a fit body and this made me feel very feminine and grown up, which is what I wanted. I will wear this dress again and again."
"I usually get size 10.5D in New Balance shoes, and those have always fit comfortably out of the box. This particular pair of shoes are still tight against the medial and lateral edges of the foot after a couple of weeks of wearing them, but I can feel them getting more loose. And the toes do not have that much clearance which presents as a downward pressure on the toes while walking. I jog in these and they still work great: they are comfortable after a couple of miles, give great support to my higher arches, allow my feet to breath a little, and look awesome."
"Great fishermans sandals! Easy on and off. Comfortable and lightweight. Our son loves these, he can run around all day. I love the added protection of the toe, no tripping, no stumbling and no jamming toes on rocks.  Quality sandal!"
Beautiful dress but the material is not very stretchy which can be uncomfortable on little kids but overall we loved it!
"Love these shirts, fit well in all the right places, and super soft!"
So much more comfortable than Toms. Super cute accent stitching and cording. Breathable canvas for spring/summer. My second identical pair!
Son loves this jacket.
These are great socks for jeans or even office slacks.
"Great color, fit & style. These shoes fit like a glove and are super comfortable. Yeah! They are definitely a keeper!"
"Bought a size larger (XL) to be safe, a large would have been fine for my 220lb 5'10"" hulk.  But even so it fits very nice.  Fabric is an expected quality for the price, not bad. Only issue is the graffic is a bit far to the left, placing the knife image under my arm.  However, that is a perfect position for cashiers to notice at the checkout and ask if you're a chef. Great work shirt for the kitchen.

TL, DR:  Fitment is good. Fabric quality is decent. Buy a more expensive shirt if you like to complain though."
I read other reviews so I bought a 9 instead of an 8 1/2 but I love then
"This jumper fits perfectly, is very stylish and is a good quality garment."
Just what I needed.  Worth money paid for it.
"When I first opened the package I couldn't see why they called them shiny. I have other satiny shiny soft to the touch leggings and I couldn't see the shine I expected. When I wore them outside and the sun hit them they were sparkling. Nothing offensive, just a subtle sparkle in the sun. I assume they will also sparkle in strong spotlights. They don't feel any different than other leggings. They are comfortable, opaque  and I like them."
Great! They are comfortable and my daughter loves wearing them!
Really nice shirt with a nice fit.
I saw this and thought it would be nice to wear to my son's wedding.  I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  It looked much prettier than in the photo.  I wore it to his wedding and on other occasions when I want to feel dressed up.
"Had been given a pair last Christmas.  Loved how warm they were, but the medium size were were way too big.  Shoe size is 7B.  Wore them as bed socks.  Wanted another pair to wear in my winter Crocs.  Ordered size XS.  Perfect!"
I like these a lot but they are kind of see through and are getting a little big now that I've worn them a few times.
Quality coveralls. Fit great.
"These Seiko Sport 5 watches are an amazing timepiece for several reasons: they are very accurate; they are very well-built, they look great; and--at the price, they are a great bargain! A twenty-one jewel watch that is this good is almost unheard of. Thanks, Seiko!"
This is my first Sporran and I believe it is in line with the price.  The hook and loop fastening seems to take away from the overall aesthetics but it is a good first time purchase.  I think a Rob Roy style sporran will be my next purchase.
"I wear a 10 shoe and these are a bit large. I'd say they are a medium to thin thickness (4 on a scale of 1-10). They aren't too thin to be an issue, but not thick enough to make them cushiony. Overall a good sock so far."
I was worried this would be cheesy but it's super cute. It does run a bit small. My son is almost 4 but still wears mostly 3T and this for him perfectly.
Very nice but would better if it was padded more.
Very comfortable Thank You.
This item arrived earlier than expected.  The workmanship is fine.
Excellent material and very stylish.
I used this in Europe this summer.  Only problem is it is very narrow so hard to get your wallet in and out but I felt better knowing that I was protected from theft.
Great buy. My grandson loves them. Wore all day with no blisters.
"Too cute and comfortable, great fit too!"
Satisfied with the color and the way it fit not too small and not too big i decided to get my usual size and it fit perfectly.
"I LOVE IT, but was sad because I expected a pair. lol totally my fault though, I just didn't read the top"
A little small but not a negative. Great hat very comfortable and warm.
"I love the shimmering and silky tights.  Very durable, no runs yet.  They are so silky, and very warm.  I have worn and washed by hand many times already."
Ordered this to wear during maternity. Ordered the XL at fits pretty well. I am 5'7'' and 170lbs now. This skirt hits below the knees a little. Skirt is pretty see through but was good with a slip under it.
Nice sleep shirt. Just the right length and comfortable.  Does not get all twisted up at night like some can. Works great on trips.
ok but small very small
"I found this on sale (about $7) and with Prime it shipped super fast. I got it the next day, immediately put it on and it was SUPER comfortable. It was just the right thickness, the colors were incredibly vibrant and it didn't fog up my glasses as much as a scarf does. I wore this on a walk with my service dog and when I had this on, the wind didn't hurt where it was covering me.
I fell in love with this product and that evening placed an order for two more. I am so excited for those to arrive. If you're thinking about trying this, find one you like that is on sale, and GO FOR IT!
No seams, no tags, comfortable as all get out and so much more.
-Written by the daughter of the account holder, after placing the order herself."
thank you so much..these shoe are really comfortable....
Definitely worth the price; well made and fun!! My son loves this costume and pretends to be Mike the Knight. I purchased a helmet to complete his appearance. Buy this costume with confidence.  My second Melissa and Doug costume; I had previously purchased the pirate.
"Great bag for someone like me that carries a survival kit in their purse. Large and spacious, perfect for my needs. Everything fits without me having to trim down the amount of ""necessities"" I carry."
"We love these shoes and will continue buying them!! Very easy to put on and take off, easy to clean when they've been outside playing in dirt or mud. Every mom needs their kids in these shoes!!"
Very pretty set.  Does run large. Beautiful fabric.
Lovely dress I my husband  buy it for me for mother's day is very pretty dress
"I am nursing my second baby so I have tried a lot of nursing bras.  Almost quit a time or two because nursing bras are SO horrible.  Last time I mostly used the medela under wire bras, but I got a lot of clogged milk ducts.  Plus I am really busty and they did not support as well as one would think from an under wire.  With this baby it was a week before I finally put a medela bra on and I ended up with a clogged milk duct.  So I decided to do some research and find the best nursing bra around no matter the price.  I ended up buying this bra and its surprisingly great.  On their website they have directions for measuring to get the right size.  I followed the directions and was on the border of a L and an XL.  I went with the XL because like I said I am busty.  Its pretty good.  A little big around, but I needed the cup size.  I may end up buying L later on when I am not quite so big.  They support pretty good for a nursing bra.  Maybe even better than some of the under wire nursing bras I have.  And they don't cut into my shoulders.  I would recommend this bra.  And especially from Amazon because its a little cheaper than other places.  I would also recommend getting it toward the end of the pregnancy.  My bras were so uncomfortable toward the of the pregnancy and these would have been much more comfortable."
Shoes fit my son as expected. He likes wearing them so they must be comfortable.
"Aside from the fact that I have trouble matching these, they are awesome.  If you like slightly mismatched socks, these are for you."
"This is a great hat for what it was designed for. Don't wear it and try to pick up chicks though, that won't go so well. It kind of makes you look like an old man or some strange nerd if you wear it in a bar at night in public. Trust me from experience it won't go well with the ladies."
This was a great buy. I bought this for my boyfriend for his b-day.  He absolutely loves it.
"Great quality, plenty of space. Only complaint is narrow spacing on bottom racks when trying to remove or replace earrings"
this is a great watch with very few down falls. this watch is very lite as far as wieght. not bulky at all. it is hard to read the date and minutes and second screen. i would highly recomend love it.
The quality is great.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and went up a size on the band and the fit is great too.  I get a ton of wear of of this bra with no worry about my straps hanging out of my racer back tanks.
It is a beautiful dress....my daughter looked so cute in it!!!!
Great nursing bra for the price. I have bought 2 and will buy a 3rd soon
need to order 9
Fits perfectly.  Seems to fit true to size (but I have a pretty small foot).  Comfortable right out of the box.  They are just that nice keen quality.
"Fits perfectly!  My daughter just loves the fit and feel!  Looks real cute as well!
Also arrived promptly!"
These are the most comfortable flip flops I have every worn.  You can tell that they good quality made shoes.  They are very stylish too.
Son is a NIKE collector and loved these shoes for his birthday.  Very lightweight and breathable fabric.  His go to shoe on a daily basis.
Very comfortable shorts.  Had purchased at Costco previously.  Gloria Vanderbilt never lets us down.
"its really pretty, thin but pretty"
Works as expected. Good buy.
"I like these shoes.  They fit my wide feet well, had minimal break in time, and have room in the toes.  They have a classic look to them and look cute with all my casual dresses."
"Very well made garment , i am 36 C, round, wide spaced  breast, bought 36. I really liked this bra itself , but unfortunately its very unflattering for my breast type - my girls flop out . Return was easy . Anyway, 5 stars for a good quality lingerie - its pretty and sexy)."
"Listen to the reviews to order bigger! I'm a shoe size 7.5, but always like my boots an 8, for thick sock room and I have thick calves. I ordered a 9 and they're great! There's still space above my toes with thin socks. They fit my calves perfectly too! I wish there was more of a tread, the bottom is kind of like slippers it's so slick. I actually like these better than my Minnetonka boots because the fringe is longer! They have great movement when walking."
They are comfortable and flattering. I remove the inserts when I wash them and they slip back in easily and stay perfect.
perfect for baby. Easy to put on her chubby feet and they stay on! WIN
Very nice and a thin material which is perfect for summer weather
"I've been on a whirlwind of buying new bras from many different companies lately, after my physical therapist told me I needed a professional fitting to get the weight off of my shoulder straps and onto my rib cage.  Turns out I was wearing 36DD and I needed to be in a 38H, which is 3 cup sizes larger!  This is finally the bra that the sales girl put me in that actually FIT, probably the first bra I've ever had that fit since my first training  bra.  The quality of this bra is amazing, and the fit is just as expected.  Every other company I've purchased from seems to have issues with the fit and/or construction.  You absolutely can't go wrong with this one, in my opinion."
Very nice boots!!! I love them
Nice material great fit washed and dried perfectly
Best flip flop ever. Supports arch like no other. Only one recommended by running store and my trainer!
They did great for my son work . He has to wear this style and is wonderfull that he had so many to choose from
I love how this skirt fits so much I bought another one!
"Looks great, feels great! What else needs to be said."
I am very pleased with these flip flops. They are nicely colored and go well with everything. It is a good thing I only ordered the size 8 as they run very large and wide. I normally use an 8-1/2 to 9 but had taken other reviews into consideration and glad that I did. They are very nice for the pool deck although I have been wearing them around the house as well as they are very comfortable. I definitely recommend them.
Love them. Perfect fit and really comfortable
"I absolutely love this top finally something that fits a full figure gal & looks cute nice material very well stitched I'm 5'5"" 170lbs & it's hard to find tops that can look flattering on 38DD Fast shipping I AM VERY PLEASED WIRH THIS PURCHASE"
Great board shorts and fit as expected.
"I owned the original LE and wore those out. Purchased the LE 2 6 months ago and actually like them better. These shoes are very comfortable and wear very well. I walk 3 or 4 miles a day and currently weigh 230 lbs. I have walked for years and these are by far the best shoes I have purchased.  Be advised though, that you should buy a half size larger. I wear a 12 street shoe and the 12.5 fits perfectly with no cramping in the toe area while not being too loose. They are somewhat pricey but as with everything you get what you pay for. A definite recommend."
I love this coat. It is a very flattering fit...cute and stylish.  My daughter and husband love the way it looks on me!
Good socks.  Fit well.  Would prefer that the top have a band of ribbing as socks normally do; with no band this causes the sock to roll down a small bit.
Fell in love with this when I first saw it. Very good quality!! I would totally recommend this for anyone who likes a classic design.
"Very nice looking, feeling, and a great fit for grandpa. He wears sweats all the time (he even sleeps in them). I will be buying these again"
"Good boots. Hurt in a few spots before they got worn in, but ya..."
"Great boots. Very comfortable, lightweight, and warm."
Love this shirt!  Head turner big time.  Its a tighter fitting shirt so compliments my body well. Great design too.
"A gifted these shoes and got a really good feedback. They are soft, comfortable and they fit well. I ordered the double wide (ww) and they don't look extra wide but they feel like it. The color is as depicted in the picture, a perfect gift"
my daughter's favorite sleep shirt...so cute
"The chain seems pretty strong, the quality seems nice. Not sure how long the finish will last based on the price, but so far it seems like a really nice necklace for the price."
"Very nice shirt but is extremely slim. No worries as it does stretch. If you are more athletic fit with longer arm, definitely order a size up. I am 5'7 180lb. Athletic build. It's snigger than most of my slim fit shirts, but feels great and I appreciate the stretch material."
Very comfy and u get the result u want !! Easy access for bathroom !! Recommend this product forth Every penny
"The product meets expectations, arrived quickly and is accurate to the description page. Great price point for what you get and the magnetic clasp works great and secures strong because once connected you can slide to secure."
"Finally a great polo shirt that fits, feels good and is not too small (euro-size), hard to find these days!"
This scarf doesn't cover all the way to shoulders as it showed in a picture.  But other than that it is ok.
great lounging pants - would recommend
"This ring is exactly what I hoped it would be.  It is a thin tri band interlocked ring that suggests the union of me, my spouse, and God in holy matrimony. It fits perfectly alongside the sterling silver engagement ring I bought elsewhere. We will treasure it always."
Got these for my husband and he loves them. Says they fill great on his feet. Would buy more later on.
love the feel of the material and very comfy
Really  like this  watch.
"I wear a size 12 in women's shoes and I'm 5'10"" and they fit just under the knee, which is what I prefer. Despite them being called ""over the knee"" socks. Maybe only if you're like 5'2"". I've gone through many pairs of knee-high striped socks and yes most are thin regardless who you buy from, and do wear out very quickly, so I recommend using the ""delicate"" setting on your washer. Don't throw them in with a bunch of jeans."
One is coming apart at the shoulder seam already.. But for the price who can complain? My girl sleep in these every night. Should probably order a couple more since I know winter is coming.
It fit didn't srink
Even though a little large they are my favorite lounging shorts. So comfortable!
Very soft and comfortable. Wish it were longer
"These are great! They stayed on much better than I expected them to, considering that I had my nipples pierced when I wore them."
"1st off, this Invicta Grand Diver packs Seiko's nh35a Automatic Movement inside the casing, for those who didn't know. That's a really good workhorse movement! Will last for many years.

My original purchase of this model came with a slight haze under the mineral crystal. You could see light greasy, circular swirl marks when under direct sunlight. Moisture obviously got into the casing somehow? Not the seller, or Amazons fault, just a manufacturer issue with that particular watch. So I clicked on exchange, they emailed me a return label to send it back within 20 days, and the seller over night shipped me the new replacement with an apology. Quick and painless! But with the replacement under examination, it had a couple of small differences from the original, which struck me as odd . The original one didn't have the ""Japan Movt"" branding underneath the 6 o'clock marker, but the new replacement does. Also, the Invicta Wings logo underneath the 12 o'clock marker was slightly different between the two, using your eagle eyes, and the sweeping seconds hand on the replacement, was ever so slightly smaller than the original one that I'm returning. I uploaded a side by side picture so you folks could see what I'm speaking of.

Now to the details of the watch > This watch has a very, very solid stainless steel bracelet! It has a buckle down clasp to secure the bracelet. Screw down case back. And a screw down crown. Those 3 things just mentioned, usually ONLY come together in higher end watches, $500 + pricetags. You get all of that with this watch, making it a very secure, divers specifications watch! Some may ask, ""what's so important about that?"". Well, when it comes to water resistance and security, the screw down case backs and crowns doesn't get any better than that for superior water/moisture protection! Plus with the added buckle clasp bracelet, there will be no accidental popping off of the bracelet while swimming or diving, and losing your watch. It's amazing you get those 3 important features with a $100 watch! That just puts this Invicta Grand Diver up there to compete with other diver watches well into the thousands of dollar costing watches! Another cool feature you don't see too often, this model has a yellow fly wheel under the case back! Usually companies put the standard silver steel wheel, but again, it's yellow on the Invicta 3045. That gives it a more sporty look with the blue bezel and blue dial on this watch. It just makes it feel more ocean sailing, sea boat captain, nautical light house feel to it! I just absolutely LOVE that combination  (sorry for the emojis)  I just had to express that feeling using em lol. I also uploaded a caseback pic for potential buyers to see 

Overall, this watch does it for me. Especially with that affordable pricetag! Keeps great time as well! Haven't lost any noticeable time with the auto movement yet. If you're considering buying this watch, I say go for it. You'll be happy with it. If you like sporty type watches, this blue on blue won't let you down! It just jumps at you as a warm sunny day on a sailboat, wearing boat shoes with Nautica shorts and a blue striped tee shirt, sipping mojitos with extra lime! Lol #Enjoy

"I love how they feel when I wear them, I have 8 pair in three different colors, I am thinking of buying more just in case they discontinue them like the last brand I had"
This is a very pretty dress and I've enjoyed wearing it!
"For me this fit true to size.  I am 5'10 140 lbs and I normally wear a size 8, sometimes a size 6,  and the Medium fits perfectly. If you are on the bigger end of a size 8 (i.e. size 8 sometimes 10) I would order a size up. For the tall gals:  My inseam is 36"" and this skirt (unfolded and just above the hip) falls just above the floor, I might actually be able to wear a low heel! The skirt I bought was ""print 10,""  it has a bit of a green cast and is not as gray as I expected it to be.  This is actually not a bad thing; the skirt is gorgeous. The fabric is a nice jersey knit, that is just heavy enough to flow nicely without being see-through. When I get a chance to take a picture of the skirt n natural sunlight I will add a photo to show the color. I will be buying more of these skirts!"
"I needed some winter boots that weren't too heavy. These are easy to run in if necessary. They are light-weight, but warm."
"Nice, soft, warm!"
This worked really well for my son. He has a hard time find shoes due to his feet being so wired but these worked just fine.
Colors were true to pictures. A good fit. Delivered ahead of promised date. Two thumbs up!
"For the cost this is a great product.  I picked them up on Amazon for a little under $4 a piece.  This is my second time buying this product.  The first time I bought four and I just recently came back for another four.  I have two in the trunk of each car and two in my camping supplies and I have two that I use a couple of times a year in the garage.  The two in the garage I hung on a wire rack and coated with ""scotchguard"" to increase the waterproofing.  With out the scotchguard in the pouring down rain they are good for about 15 minutes of heavy rain before they start to let water seep through to your clothes.  With the scotchguard... a little over an hour.  The hole for my face was slightly to small so I cut a tiny slit with a pocket knife at the chin and it has worked great ever since.  This is a great ""stop gap"" type product.  It will keep you dry while you change a tire in the rain or any number of small chores while it is raining.

Here is the thing:  They are cheap and they fold up tiny.  They are great for something to use in a pinch to keep you dry.  They are not going to be great if you plan on standing in the rain all day.  For that I would spend a little more money and buy something that is a little thicker."
Awhile back I ordered this bracelet. It was so cute and I was so pleased with it that I ordered it again and now have a necklace to match. Both were a good value!
Super cute! Love the vibrant blue. My 4-year-old loves them even when it's not raining. He wears them every day!
"Jewelry Polishing Cloth, Large, works Great, jewelry looks brand NEW"
Nice fit for my son.
This watch works fine.
this works great and will probably get another one
They are okay to wear around the house but were smaller than I expected and look like pajama jeans.
THIS WAS A GIFT AND SHE LOVED IT.
Good support for runners. My son runs distance at least 50 miles per week and these are great shoes for him.
comfortable and just what i was looking for
I purchased this shirt as a father's day gift. My father-in-law received it this weekend and loves the color and pattern as well as the fit.
"The belt came early. The fit is great. The material is a little softer than I expected, which is great for comfort. Not so much for durability if it's a work belt you're looking for. Other than that it's a good product at a great price."
Wished it was a couple inches longer but I am 5'9 so probably should have been expected. Love the fit.
"looks nice good length, fabric is soft and comfortable."
These sneakers are the definition of comfort.  Perfect for my running and perfect to wear on a daily basis.  Asics new exactly what they were doing when they created this sneaker.
"Love these glasses, fits my son perfect!,"
Great size with lots of inserts. Would suggest you only place 1 credit card per insert and they may split on you but there are plenty insert to use.
"This wrangler cowboy cut shirt is a quality garment. The shirt is warm enough, but breathes, so is not sweaty. The double pockets are perfect, and the cut is roomy. The snap front is easier than buttons, and looks better, too. Recommended for guys and gals! For a heavier weight shirt, try:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrangler-Men-s-Cowboy-Cut-Work-Western-Long-Sleeve-Shirt/dp/B0007SMLB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrangler Men's Cowboy Cut Work Western Long Sleeve Shirt</a>."
"Very comfortable smooth material. Comfortable, great looking fit."
"True to size, however, not as long proportions as pictured. I'm personally glad it's not long and is an average sweater length, but someone else might make the same assumption as I did that it looks longer, is longer, and then be disappointed. I wear US women's size small, but I always go a size up when ordering sweaters and jackets. A medium fits me great. One thing worth noting is that the purple looks BLACK with a hint of midnight purple and not very purple purple - dark purple in person. Maybe it will lighten up with washes...I hope. It is extremely dark! Someone might think it is black if they didn't have a black piece of cloth right next to it. Quality seems pretty good. Overall, I'm satisfied, but really wish it was more purple. The whole reason I went with this sweater was that I couldn't find my size, style, and price range in the color I wanted except for this brand. I really needed it to be closer to how it's pictured."
"Very nice, however, these are not clip ons; they are screw backs, so my granddaughter  will not wear them."
"Bought this sandal in black and loved it so much that I also ordered it in brown. It's very, very comfortable...easy to walk in. I would really recommend this sandal, the sole is super comfy and soft, and it feels like walking on clouds. The only problem I have in general, is that the size chart is incorrect. I'm a US size 8...which is a 39 in European size. The size chart, however, says that a US size 8 is a European size 38. That is incorrect. I wish they would fix this. But this has nothing to do with the shoe itself. I knew ahead of time what size I needed, so I had no issue once it arrived. Wonderful shoe, I LOVE the Spring Step brand!!!"
My personal preferred brand for running. Very comfortable and lightweight. Held out for good price.
"YEARS ago I bought Isotoner Women's Pillow Step Slide slippers locally in a dept store.  They are the best slippers I've ever owned!!  Am looking for another pair as they are just now beginning to not be so soft (and I'm not a light-weight!)--maybe washing them would puff up the padding again.  I want another pair before they stop making them!--that usually happens, when you find something good it eventually disappears & that'd be sad for these slippers to disappear because they are just great!  Thanks to Isotoner for a great slipper!  Keep making them!"
"My only complaint is with the length of the shoelaces.  I don't understand why they are so long.  You have to make huge loops and double tie them to keep them from coming untied.  Otherwise, I really like them.  There is enough room for me to have my orthotics in the shoe on top of the regular insole (which I previously had to remove)."
"I bought these sandals after borrowing my daughter's to walk to the mailbox--that was all it took!  I had donated all of my ""flip flop"" type sandals since they either had poor arch support or I found my toes gripping too hard as I walked in them--neither of which I thought was good for my feet over the long term!  These have excellent arch support and are easy to walk in without excessive toe-gripping!  This is a great price on Amazon since these are pricey with a wide selection of colors."
"I'm a 9, bought a 39, flawless fit. These shoes are adorable and comfortable. I wore them for a full day at work, on my feet all day, and no blisters or aches. The arch support is minimal,  so if that is a requirement for you, you'll want an insert.  I don't like the size chart they have in the pictures. It's not accurate for my understanding of EU sizing. I went with what I thought I knew and I was pleased.
 I highly recommend these shoes."
"Great belt, will buy again!"
The sweatshirts are a little big but are in excellent condition.
I love this but have not had a chance to wear it
wife likes em! Boom!
pants fit and they last!
I bought these for my husband who works on his feet all day long.  Very comfortable for all day.  Would definitely buy them again.
I simply love this dress. I bought it to wear to a wedding. I always buy things that are returnable.  I am short and a little on the heavy side so i was worried about 'fat rolls' showing real bad. After reading all the reviews I ordered a size bigger. It fits perfect! It is not tight. Very comfortable!  And does not make any fat rolls hang out! I love it! Very nice quality and a great price!!!
"Love my yellow box flips.  I live in Az so they get a lot of usage! Four pairs so far.  So comfortable, very durable.  I have both the lower heel and also the 3 inch wedges!  Love love love"
Other reviews stated this shirt was tighter than they expected so I purchased a large rather than a medium however I definitely could have used my regular medium & been just fine. If I chose to order again I would do so. Shirt itself is perfect! I received lots of compliments even with me ordering a size too big!
"Wow its long and sharp, its so perfect!"
If you buy a wide get half size smaller.
"As an avid watch collector, this is my first Fossil and leather strap.  I must say the leather strap is very comfortable.  The dial is not that busy for a chronograph, the blue is darker than the picture.  The case is at 44 mm, which appeals to people who like larger time pieces and smaller ones.  I like watches that are 45-52 mm, and I an comfortable with this one.  Overall, this is a great watch for the price."
I got my Vionic sandals really quickly and I really like them. I have neuropathy in my feet and got these shoes to see if they would help with the foot pain. I am very well pleased with the difference in the way my feet feel.
"Super comfy. I live in Portland and can verify that they are definitely waterproof and a total life saver in wet conditions. The gray turns into brown with enough use, but they're still cute."
Enjoy wearing this caftan. It is very elegant looking and comfortable. Bought three of these!!
great add on
"I've bought the Carhartt Men's Canvas Work Dungaree B151 off Amazon twice now.  Each time I ordered 48x32, once in Light Brown and once in Black.  The brown wasn't quite the color I pictured in my head, but both times the pants fit great and are very comfortable.  I have not yet worn either pair long enough to judge their durability, but I expect it to be good given that they're Carhartt."
"Very comfortable, gives me just a little extra height. At 5'3"" every little bit helps."
I had no problem with the seller or the product in this transaction.  These are pretty light weight which is what I wanted.  Living in the south  lots of times things are too heavy. Also these were available in medium.  Lots of time things can only be found in a large.  And the pattern is pretty unique..  These are a gift and I know the recipient will enjoy them.
This fits great. I'm 199 lbs and usually wear a 1x. Ordered this in XL and it fits well. Will be wearing this under my summer dresses. Love it!
"Bought this for my dad. Great price. He loves the Carhartt brand. I love that they come in tall because my dad is 6'4"" and has a hard time finding jackets that fit his arm length."
"An amazing product! I fits perfectly on me. The measurement was the same as advertised. I will only suggest that you do a better job on the breast pocket design and make it neater. Otherwise, I like it. Product was not as the seller advertised it. It was too small! The quality of the material is also very poor. Waste of my money. Can you please send me back my money or at least something that really fits?"
"Thanks for the great Amazon, can give me a platform, let me on the other end of the globe, also can buy a quality and cheap, good workmanship, send mother, mother love, praise incessant very much, so I feel relieved, this can give my mother happy, proud of you, great quality, great fabric, great detail, everything great, I love the Amazon, I love Tommy Hilfige,I went to the Amazon shopping, too good, and I want to introduce you to my friends, also hope that they can get the same mood. And I hope, keep quality, variety, brand, diverse, cater to our overseas customers wish..."
"I love the sweatshirt although I should add that I ordered a size bigger so it wouldnt be too small when washed, and it wasn't ""loose"" at all.. In fact it for perfect.. So I would def order one size up. But other than that  it's really nice/warm."
Top was too big but the bottom fit perfectly
Great dress...flattering colors for tropical tan
Nice fit - fits as expected.
This was not a 7.5; it was a 7 and too short.  The 7.5 was not available but would have been a perfect fit.  I love the shoe!!
Love them! Fits as expected!
Cute and soft! I will buy more of these.
"I love it. I want a watch. Then I saw this kind of watch. I love this kind, so I bought this watch."
"I have 2 pairs.  I love these boots.  Super comfy and long wearing.  I can wear these all day long and not be miserable. One caveat, the calf part is stretchy but will only go so far so if you have larger calfs, these may not work for you."
"First impression on opening the package was that the bandanas were stiff and not soft at all. I threw them in the wash and they did soften up, but I think it may take a few washings to really get them soft enough to use them without being scratchy. The colors were bright, but the cloth is not the highest quality and you can see where the dye is splotchy. There were also threads that needed to be clipped after washing.  The bandanas are made in China. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review"
Nice product.  I plan to order again.
good price. Bracelet changes the color
Wide hip pocket for wallet.  Washes and wears very well.
"I normally wear an 8.5, and knew that I had to order a larger size, based on prior Teva purchases. These shoes do fit a bit snug across the bridge of your foot.  For me, Tevas run smaller than Keen or Merrell shoes."
"Obviously you are limited to the numbers of cards it states it can hold.  So don't expect to squeeze in any additional cards.  You can't. If you can live with 6 cards, plus ID and cash this is perfect.  I've been using it for a week and really like it.  I had to ditch a couple of rewards cards, but I think it's worth it.

It holds the cards very well.  They won't fall out.  Easy to access your ID which is a nice plus.  Cash is also easy to get to.

Every time I open it I get some comments from the cashier.  I use an RFID card to for access at work and I have it under the cash which is not shielded and it works just fine!!"
I like this hat warm lite weight i wish the face mask snapped on instead of velcro but it doesn't take away from my stars
This is a fun little chef's hat for your young one to wear while they are helping you out in the kitchen.  It has an expandable velcro strip to help fit the hat securily on your child.
"I bought it for my boyfriend he loves it.
Size fits him perfectly and it also arrived on time :))"
Good product.  Keeps the wind and cold out.
"I was a little hesitant to order these because of the differing reviews about the size. I read a review on another site that said the back is soft, so I ordered a half size smaller than I usually wear, a 9.5 rather than a 10 and the 9.5 fits perfectly. The sole and heel are thick enough to get me through the slush and some snow without wet feet. Love Skechers shoes!"
"I am a 34F.  Yup.  Considering how much trouble I have finding bras that fit and make me look human - even when trying them on in the stores,, this fit ALMOST perfectly.  It looks like I am about to fall out, but considering it's the PRETTIEST bra I have EVER worn in my life, and I still have about 25 lbs. to lose, I am very hopeful it will soon fit perfectly.  Gives me nice looking, rounded, firm looking, young looking boobs.  Very happy."
it's comfortable and just casual nothing fancy ok for the price.
Add a set of gel inserts and these shoes are practically perfect!
Super cute and relatively comfy. I'm not a heel girl but I could wear these all day if I had to. Only complaint is I wish they had my size in leather/pleather  not just this suede kind.
Mom can no longer reach down to tie a shoe.  These are great because you can just slip them on and they also help with an elderly persons balance.  All of the Therapist at the hospital and rehab wanted to know were I got these.
"Bought this for my husband & I love the symbolism, price, quality & spare necklace. I would highly recommend this :)"
Nice ! No ironing and fits a pudgy guy nicely. These shirts are easy to launder and they hold their color well.
"Love these shoes. Easy to slip on and off and they get noticed. My son wears these 6+ hours/day at his preschool and specifically requests to wear them. They're durable too. Although they are made of suede/leather uppers, I plan to just spot clean and brush off dirt when cleaning."
"This item is truly beautiful. The picture online had me believing that the print on the maroon would be black but that wasn't the case. The latches are solid and the lace in the back makes the corset really easy to adjust.

Cons: I ordered a small and I nearly ran out of lace in the back adjusting it to fit. There is even a flap in the inside of the back so your skin doesn't show after you've adjusted the corset; however, i had to adjust it so much that the flap didn't even cover the gap. I wear a size small in everything. my bra size is a 32-34, I wear a 2-4 size pants and am 123 lbs. The small was too small, way too small!

The corset is really lovely though, and comes with a matching thong. I recommend this purchase but definitely buy a size up."
Bought this for my husband because he doesn't like the typical geek shirts you see on everyone. Gets tons of compliments and he loves it. Fits good and is made well.
"I was wary after reading the reviews. I just moved back to MN, and needed some durable face protection. This thing is pretty comfortable and not too itchy. I had read complaints about needing to align the ""breathing vent"" and they're not wrong, but it's not terrible if it's a little twisted. I like the hinge feature a lot. Pull the face down, and the head barely moves. Vice versa, flip the top back and your face is still covered. It does put some pressure on your nose, but I imagine all of these type of masks do to some degree. I do end up adjusting it more than I would like, but for the price it seems like a keeper."
"This beautiful Italian leather handbag just arrived yesterday and I absolutely love it!! I read the other woman's review that this handbag had too many zippers but there's only two zippers on the side. Ladies, talk about having a handbag as if you bought it straight from Italy. The leather is definitely Italian handmade and I can tell that it will last for many years and will not go out of style. So it's worth the price."
"This is a very nice sweater vest! The colors are very white and very black. The material is pretty soft, not itchy at all. This vest can be very versatile, you can dress it up with slacks and a tie, or go for a more casual look and match it up with a pair of jeans. I highly recommend this vest!
I did receive this for a free or discounted price for my honest review. The opinions are 100% my own."
"My daughter is 9 years old and wears a 3.5 sneaker, and they fit great. She loves the colors. She is wearing them for indoor soccer."
WILL BUY MORE
"It's a very nice pearl necklace. I think it's more dark green then black pearls. Some imperfections, but I really love my necklace anyways."
"This is a great buy! It came on time, it looks great and the material is quite good!"
nice pocket watch. great for a person who collects coins. nothing like the old half dollar
"I usually buy nikes or asics,and decided to take a chance on these since the reviews looked pretty good. Love them for walking and running. Very comfortable without a adding additional inserts! Considering getting another pair. :)"
"Super comfortable, a little long but I am only 5'3"" so I'm used to that.  Wish it was a V-neck but it is great with a long necklace to add character.  Receive lots of compliments each time I wear it."
"Cute robe, glad I listened to other reviews and ordered a size up."
Nice shoe horns. Much better than plastic ones.
overall good pair of shorts. Fabric isn't too cheap feeling and the distressed look is exactly what I was looking for. I saw how it ran small so I got a large and even worried that it would be too large but it fits snug! I'm 130 lbs and 5'3 with larger hips. Cheeky but not too revealing.
"I purchased two pairs over the holidays for my teenage girls, they like the boots and say they are comfy and warm. Both of my girls had UGGs previously, but these are much more affordable and they say they like just as much. The fit true to size, they don't look or feel cheap. I would recommend over UGG because of the price and comparable quality."
"The shirt arrived today sooner than it was stated to arrive. I opened the package and was pleasantly surprised at what nice quality the shirt was. The material is a nice weight and very soft. The PEACE design on the shirt is absolutely gorgeous!  It has both sequence and silver material paint and you can't miss that it says PEACE! It seems to run a little large. I originally ordered it for my granddaughter but when it came tried it on and saw that it fit me and how nice it was I decided to keep it for myself. I ordered the medium and it is quite roomy.  It has a nice length to it with the VO logo on the bottom corner. It falls nicely on the shoulders and has a nice neckline. It is not a fitted shirt so its lose and extremely comfortable. I am very pleased with this shirt and was lucky enough to receive it at a discounted price for my honest review. I have attached a picture and the picture doesn't show how pretty the shirt really is.

I am updating my review after washing the top, it washed beautifully. I laid it out to dry after washing it in the machine on gentle. All the bead work stayed nicely in place. The shirt kept its shape. Also when I first got this shirt it came with additional beads should any come loose and need to be replaced,  I forgot to mention that  in the original review."
Cleans great what can you say.
"Excellent quality! Awesome price! I'm a 2-4 in clothing. After reading reviews, and expecting it to run small, I ordered a medium. Both pieces are too big, so I reordered small. Top has hook in back , so it has to fit to stay on."
"They are Levi's.  50 bucks a pair.  They last forever. They've been around for years.  if you want the best, most comfortable jeans, then these are it.  Just make sure to review the Levi's website and learn about what the different numbers mean so you get the fit you want.

However...due to recent Supreme Court Decisions regarding healthcare and States Rights, soon NOBODY will have a job, healthcare, or money.  So why are you looking at jeans anyway?  The upside is that the US Government will finally have achieved equality of outcome.  We'll all be equal.  Very glad I bought these before the fall of civilization.  You should buy as many pair as you can afford right now and you should buy them from Amazon while the internet still works and the US Transport System still functions."
8 year old granddaughter is a Happy Camper
the steel toe is a little uncomfortable
"Perfect for the occasion. Fit as expected my niece is 2 months away to be 4 years old and size 4-5 fit perfect. Comfortable, she didn't complain about the lace been itchy or rough. It is white and versatile."
Good fit. Good comfort. Still alive.
This nylon pant keeps me warm during cold mornings.  The quality is really good.
"The design and materials are very good, especially considering the price. I've bought quite a few sets of these and always get compliments on them, even from people wearing $200 ties."
Bought these for my husband. They fit as expected - his regular size. Somewhat slim fit.  Good quality. Would recommend.
"The spaghetti strap denim romper received two compliments from strangers on the first wearing- that's the good news. The denim is a little heavier than expected with a description of ""thin material"" in the fabric choices. Buttons were bigger than button holes, and I employed a seam ripper to get them to fit. It washes and dries well. It is as comfortable as it appears."
Beautiful chain. Looks much more expensive than what we paid for it! Very happy!
"This shoe fits well, and was true to size. My size is 12W. I also have the same shoe in navy color. I receive compliments every time I wear them. They are very comfortable. I would recommend to all who like this style."
Beautiful boots and I love them.  After reading reviews I ordered half a size up because I have wider feet. If you have narrow feet you could probably wear your regular size.
I'll admit I was hesitant to buy anything with tulle on it for an infant because it can be scratchy - this is the SOFTEST tulle I have ever felt in my life!!! My grand-daughter had zero reaction to it and it didn't bind.
Very good quality gave to my wife as gift
Great design and quality; perfect fit right out of the package!
Love hue socks!
"these saved my butt from slipping in the Sequoias!  these are a definite must when walking around icy snow because it gives you the confidence that you can walk fast without slipping.  these do run a big large but I was able to tighten up the Velcro strap to make it more snug.  I'm a size 5.  they are kind of hard to put on but once they're on, they're stabilized until you take them off."
LOVE KANU!  That have taken care of us when the fit isn't right!
"I absolutely LOVE these earrings! They are my new favorites. They are simple but elegant and go with almost anything. I have had them for a few months, and they are just as shiny as they were the first day. I also love that they are light and comfortable- I hardly know I am wearing them. I highly recommend!"
"good quality, nice look, proper B width"
sofar i like it
"Perfect, as well as the service."
I  love this wedge sneaker!!! It's stylish yet comfortable. They really look great with skinny jeans. They fit true to size. These are HOTT!!!
"I live in Massachusetts and this coat does a great job at keeping me warm. It's well-made and stylish. I like that the fur around the hood is detachable.

It fits snug so I'm unable to wear thick sweaters underneath but the coat still manages to keep me warm.

My sole complain, which is pretty frustrating, is with the zipper. It has two pulls. When fully zipped, the bottom part of the zipper starts to unzip. This shouldn't happen with a $300-ish coat. I deal with it because the rest of the coat is great. I just hope I don't end up with a snagged/broken zipper as a result."
The waist coubd have been higher but overall these are terrific
"Beautiful, functional, soft, roomy wallet. Quality is superb."
"I am smitten with this bag ! The graphics are fabulous, and the construction very sturdy. Quite well made, with cute touches. It is not stiff, but again, very substantial for a cloth product. I would highly recommend for someone who wants to expand the usual black or brown options.."
sent back. small band. that said very good watch for the money
Great pants.  Didnt get any bug bites at all from a 5 day hiking trip.  If you got to hot you can zip off the legs and turn them into shorts. Very lightweight and dries quickly.  Ideal for hiking
"My husband love's them...wears them to work everyday, says they are comfortable"
This necklace is stunning! Can't wait to wear it. Comes in an elegant black box. Would make a great gift.
Love love love these! I've decided I'm buying all of the women in my family these for Christmas!
Adorable - small fits a 10 year old.
"This is a really nice swimsuit. The fit is perfect. I'm 5"" and weigh 164 pounds. I carry most of my weight up top with a 36F bra, I'm surprised I don't tip over, lol. I love this swimsuit and would buy more if they had them."
I love these crocs. So comfortable. So pretty.
Beautiful headband! All the stones and pearls were intact. It fits my 2 year old's big round head perfectly!
"Subtle pink color with exceptional shine. This glides on easily with the spongy-tip wand. The container is made to be connected to other Jouer products and has a slot on one side that you can slide onto another product. If you're just purchasing this one item the slot is a little annoying because your fingers catch on it. If you're using it for its intended purpose it's nice. Really nice to see that this is paraben free and that it has plenty of good-for-you ingredients, such as vitamin E, Shea butter, and jojoba seed oil. This is fragrance free."
Got this and love it - its lined so its not itchy like some of the other petticoats I have bought before.
"This did fit a bit smaller than I expected but it's a BEAUTIFUL, sassy dress. I contemplated sending it back, but chose to lose a bit more weight instead. ;-) GORGEOUS dress for the price."
Holds up to many washes and still looks great. What else could you ask for. Fits loose which is a plus for me.
"Very nice looking shoes for cheap, doesn't even look cheap, love the style and color, only concern I have is that its very slippery wish the heel part was rubber."
Love these shoes. They really accent my legs. They are very comfortable too.
Just what he needed.love it.
"Good fit, feels light. Very easy to take off and put on the lower portion of the pants. Sadly, I was postholing through snow and ripped the pants as I scratched my shin on an unseen granite rock. I still loved it so much, Ive ordered a replacement."
This item fits well and is stretchy. I love the back cut out. I would recommend to others. Nice dress.
"the clock is very good and many blows have resisted me because it use during the work day, is of excellent performance and very comfortable to use, nonweight and in spite of using it in the work has an pleasant appearance."
"Thin, but as seen. Fits well. Good price."
Fits good. make sure you order watch pins with it.
I love the dress is exactly what I expected; I'm 135lb hourglass shape and medium fit me perfectly. No bra needed for this dress is thick and well made.
"Standard rain boots. A little tight around the toes, but I've wide cave man feet ;)"
great bathing suite
Perfect in size color.. As shown
Great pants fits well  will buy more
These are my girls' favorite! The are low enough that they don't stick out of their pants but cover them up. They stay put and don't bunch up or tug around the elastic. We always get this kind now!
"Very nice bra. I like that it goes on in one piece like a sports bra. I usually wear sport bras because I can never find a regular bra that is comfortable.  Which brings me to the fact, since I usually wear sport bras, this push up bra makes me feel like I have the girls on a platter ready to be served. I'm not complaining,  it will just take some time to present my newly busty self to the world. I'm  38/40B, possibly C cup ( Menopause has added a cup size) , but I've always been athletic and not one to flaunt my assets.  But I think I'll get used to it!  BTW, I ordered the x -large and it fits fine."
"these socks are worth every penny. very comfy, fit perfect (i ordered small and wear size 5 adult women). I used them in a half marathon- no blisters. I will be replacing all my socks with these."
Perfect fit and so comfortable....and they stay on.
Comfortable durable boot !
These are very comfortable and keep my feet nice and toasty
Good Product.  Works well.
This skirt is one size only but the drawstring elastic waist gives plenty of room to grow!
"F'ing adorable. I opened them up and they were much sleeker than I expected. They are a little tight and hard to get on, but I expect them to loosen up as summer rolls on. The arch support is great! I walked about 4 miles in them the day I got them, and I had to aches or pains in my foot, other than the strings started to rub on my toes making them tender. The next day after walking I got a blister on the top of my foot. I do not plan to return these, but maybe ordering a half size up is something to consider. I still love them!"
"Daughter wanted this for a costume, no complaints from her, she was happy with it."
Beautiful and delicate. Exactly what I was looking for. Excellent quality. Would use this seller again.
Lee women's relaxed fitted  jeans  are very  comfortable.
"very nice article - a bit see-through, but Works!"
Does the job and look good.
"Very nice, bright, on time"
I loved it! I don't think my brother felt the same way about it though. It arrived on time and the quality was exactly as I expected.
My Daughter absolutely love this sweater! Great Quality
"love slip-ons, love vibrate ""barefoot"" shoes."
A little small but still a great shoe
Adorable suit! Just a little small for any girl who has somewhat of a butt! Lol Very flattering though in the chest area!
So incredibly soft and comfortable!!
I love how this dress fitted....quite elegant and the size 4 fitted perfectly.  I wore it with a coral shoes and bag to a morning wedding.
"Comfortable, durable, and they don't ride up or anything! I bought three of these so that I don't run out anytime soon."
"great purchase, the quality is not bad either."
Love these nighties. I have about eight of them. They are the only one's I will wear. Super comfy.
Great shoes!  No need to break them in.  Wear right out of the box.  Most comfortable shoes ever.
Perfect tote for quick stops to the store.  Thick canvas.
Very cute and well made cap.  Cute as a bug.  Great gift.
Very pretty ring. Fits well and looks expensive!
Who doesnt love Blingy FitFlops?? I have seevral pairs of these .. Super comfortable.. an all day shoe for sure..
This pants fits my boyfriend just fine. It was a good buy.
Beautiful blue color! fits true to size and made very nicely!
"This Hoodie Jacket was a Christmas gift for my Grandson, he just loves it. Good quality material, colors are sharp and looks Great."
"I ordered a size 3x 29"" inseam they arrived in a couple of days, & they fit very comfortably. These pants are thin and a bit see through, but that can be fixed by wearing black under wear. The material is light, cool, flowing, and the length is almost floor length. They fit comfortably snug around the mid section, buttocks and upper thigh area. These Palazzo pants were a great buy for me, I really like them a lot."
Great quality slippers.  Comfortable and true to size but not as cushiony as I expected them to be.
Very nice shoe one of the only one I could find with composite toe and waterproof!
im loving it
"These sandals are very comfortable and are perfect for dress casual. They easily can be worn for a 2 mile walk, but would probably wear a different type of sandal for greater distance."
"Looks great, but fits just a touch smaller than other pants of similar size. I figured that for the price it would have been pretty cheap material, but its actually good quality linen material. Wearing this on my wedding day for my beach ceremony and couldn't be happier."
"Worth the money, in surviving my 12 hour clinicals"
There's still an issue with the straps! The bodice is great but there's something on those  overlapping hooks that scratch/irritate my shoulders.
"I've owned a lot of pairs of Tom's over the last couple of years, but this was my first pair with the rope sole.  I've had them for a few weeks, and the rope is already pulling away from the main part of the shoe.  Don't think these will last as long as other pairs I have owned."
I was looking for a black shoe that could be use as casual or dress casual. I've owned Merrell shoes in the past and have always been pleased with their shoe. This shoe is comfortable and is just what I was looking for in appearance. I was unable to find this shoe in my local area. I took a chance ordering a shoe online without first trying them on. It worked out well.
Cute and my daughter loves them.
"I get many compliments whenever I wear it. It is true to the picture, so it will not be very shiny (a plus for me). It will keep looking good for a long time and can easily be cleaned and restored to its original beauty with a little bit of baking soda and a microfiber cloth."
"For the price, these sunglasses are very nice & well made. The are comfortable to wear and light, and the hinges are sturdy.  For me personally  these are too narrow a style for my oval/round face.  Nonetheless, the quality for the $$ is first-rate"
Love the hi definition
Very minimal shrinkage
I wear an 8.5 and these fit perfectly
Gets a lot of compliments.
"I really like these.  Have had them for a few months now, no complaints at all."
"It got me free drinks, even with my boyfriend next to me sooooo I'd say it works well"
"I love these shoes.  However, they are ""stretching"" out fast and are starting to get big already.  Didn't expect that to happen.  Also the heel is getting a ""chewed up"" look because the covering material doesn't hold up to regular wear and tear."
"Good product, great price."
"These are my favorite shoes! I bought them to use as slippers. I wear them everyday all day if I am at the house. They are sized perfectly. I wear a size 8 and they fit me to a tee. The color is just as pictured. They are a firmer bottom but I like that they aren't think like Dearfoam slippers. I wear stillettos all day and my food doctor advised me to transition to a soft shoe afterwards due to the shock it puts on your feet to go to a flat surface. None the less, they have exceeded my expections. I love the Skechers brand."
The sunglasses are great! But the question were about shoes....in this review
"I really loved these shorts but unfortunately they were smaller than my normal size, so try to size up!"
These are sturdy and can hold a lot of clothing. They pack well into small suitcases and help in organizing clothing for prolonged travel. Not the most stylish on the market but they work and the price is right!
"Great purse, doesn't wipe clean as easily as advertised, but holds everything really well and is nice and light."
"These are great. I wear them alone, under clothing for layers and just to accentuate my legs and butt. They're long and have a lot of stretch. Would recommend."
So cute and good grip on bottoms
"These bras are way better than I was expecting them to be. They're very comfortable, and fit perfectly. The band has a decent amount of stretch too. Nothing was poking out, no hanging strings and the colors are very vibrant and true to the image. We'll see how long they hold up, but for the price, so far I would say that I would buy these again."
"I didn't expect such soft, nice leather. It's thin, but will hold everything I will ever need it for when I travel.  Way better than any plastic cases, or the smaller passport holders that were actually too small! This is a very nice product!"
I think this is a great sweater.  Love that you can machine wash.  It looks more dressy than other sweaters.  It was a gift for my husband.
"My husband loves this brand of underwear bc of the fit and the material.  I didn't understand all of the hype and the expense, but he says it's worth the $$. Buy your husband a pair and I guarantee he asks for another!! We've only bought the fiesta and modern fit."
These Skechers were a really fabulous buy.
The dress is beautiful and fits perfectly.
"Really nice till the oil from your skin swells up the rubber part and the eye glasses fall off.
 Good thing there three. Would like to see them last longer though."
LOVE this stuff. Hair feels amazing after. little goes a long way and concentrate on the root areas more.
"Beautiful wig! Exact same color as shown. If I were to buy this at a wig shop, would cost about $30! So worth it. Fast shipping, too!"
"They are consistently Levi's in quality, fit, and durability. There is a green cast to this gray, so be advised. I wear them because I have narrow hips and have always been too skinny for the ladies cuts."
Quality merchandise.
Kids were happy with gift.
"Good looking, stylish purse."
"Nice stockings, perfect color, stayed up great, loved them"
"For the price it is wonderful just don't expect years worth of wear.  The backing comes off easily after several wearing but as I said, price is wonderful and easy able to purchase several as the years go by.  Variety of colors is wonderful too.  Great company."
"This is a pretty nice watch band, maybe on of my fanciest, but is for sure not the real deal, a nice hand made completely leather watch band you'll have to pay more for, but it at least looks the part! using this for my seiko snk803."
My husband looks GREAT in this beautiful jacket.  Good quality fabric.  Excellent fit.
This is a beautiful quality ring that my son was pleased to receive. And you can't beat the price. I'm very satisfied!
Great Halloween costume!!
These are fantastic shoes!  My son is delighted to have a new pair.  He did not want to wear anything else.
"Love it!  I received this in the red wine color and it looks just like the pictures.  The material is stretchy and soft - it feels very nice on the skin.  It is a medium weight material, so it is not too light or heavy.  The material is thick enough that it is not sheer at all, I could not see anything under it and it lays smooth on the body.  The front is a little higher at the bottom than it is in back, which is consistent with the styles that are out there right now.  The sleeves came to a little past the wrist bones and the bottom comes to about the point between the ankle and the knee.  Although the instructions said to hand wash, I put it in the washer/dryer and it came out looking good (I did use delicate settings though). I think it looks especially good when paired with some skinny jeans and some boots!  It is so comfortable to wear and I like it so much, I just bought a navy one at full price! If they had a brown, I would have bought that too.

I received this item free in exchange for using it and providing my honest, unbiased feedback.  The price I paid had no bearing on my review, as I have no relationship with the seller and I never guarantee a good review."
These shoes are very stylish and comfortable
Very comfi
In rainy NorCal this Seattle Sombrero preformed perfectly.  Looks great fits great.
"How did I ever live without these boots?  They are so easy to put on with the grab holes on either side, and once on they are the warmest boots ever and the most  comfortable too.  I usually wear a size 8 shoe, so that's what I ordered and the fit is perfect with a fairly heavy sock."
love these slacks!
I got a XL after reading a review from a woman that said she was 5'3 and 250 and that's my exact height and size..safe to say I should've went up a size only reason I'm keeping it is because I plan on losing 20 pounds by August
"according to the reviews thanks to them, l ordered a full size larger. I wear a Men's size 9, I got the size 10. they fit great a size larger. very comfortable shoe. I love them."
Not great material (thin) but good to knock around the house in...
Love the look and fit. Great casual pants.
Took a little bit to get here- but came from afar- but love it!
Good quality it'd fit perfect if I  was a little shorter if your tall get a bigger size
"When I first tried these shoes they were very stiff and hard. I was very disappointed for a day or two, By the third day they started to soften and at the moment I wear then all day and can tell you they are very comfortable.

A note after 2 months using them:  This shoes are staining my socks after 2 months of use. This is a problem I find in some black fit flops I own. I was expecting it to go away, but it hasn't."
Nice skull cap.
"My 3-year-old girl wears size 8 shoes, and these size 8 ballet shoes fit her just as well! After only a few wears the inside started to show signs of use, which didn't bother me but may bother others. My toddler loves to wear these shoes whenever she is in a ballet mood."
"Fabulous!!!Gorgeous!! Looking for shoes with unusual heels....well let me tellyou, these are the shoes for you gals or guys that feel the like I do .The more different the better. I have the black and nude colors and iam giddy about both,however the black pair had some nicks on the heels,but I would probably be making the same nicks once iI wear them a few times. No big deal and as I'm concerned. I wear size 8  and fit to a tee."
Love these! Well made! Adorable!
"This little tool is just what I needed! In less than five minutes, I was able to remove a link from a bracelet I'd shrunken out of. Removing the two pins was an easy processtwisting the large knob controls the actual pin remover, and the smaller, metal knob on the side controls the height of the remover tool, depending on the thickness of the band you are trying to adjust.

This tool also comes with three extra pins with which you can push out pins on the band of your choosing. I tried to see if there was a difference between the three extras and the one already in the tool, and I couldn't find it, so I believe they are simply extras should you lose or break the one in there (though I can't imagine it breaking or wearing down easily, given its function). The plastic is thick and sturdy, and was easy enough to figure out. If you know this is the tool you need, but aren't sure how to use it, there is a small slip with instructions on it in the packaging; a quick Google or Youtube search can give you a visual walkthrough.

If you have several accessories, or even just one, that have a chain link band that needs a tool like this, I'd highly recommend iteven at MSRP. In my experience, jewellers will charge around $5 to perform this simple task for you; buying this will, in the long run, save you time and money.

"Go just a half size up, not a full size. My daughter is a 12 regular width in street shoes and the 13 regular is too big. She just wears thick socks and they are ok, but a 12.5 would have been perfect with room to grow. Otherwise they are great. Not sure why some are advising the wide for average width girls - regular is fine."
"After reading all the reviews I ordered the next size up and glad I did. Fits the 'girls' perfectly and it's nice and long. Although I didn't use the bottoms it came with, paired it with a swim skirt"
"I'm always scared to order swimwear online. But this is perfect - great fit, length and quality. I am very satisfied."
read that they run somewhat small so we ordered 1/2 size up from normal and they fit great.
Love it!!! Very happy with my purchase!!
too large for s size
I've been wearing converse all my life. They don't have much foot support but I'm willing to deal with it. These shoes last for years and years.
"These are the best to go ""slogging"" around in the garden on those muddy days and are comfortable enough. My only lament is that they are not as ""tough"" as work boots for shoveling in this Central TX. clay type soil. I keep mine right at the back door and slip them on and it is too simple."
Loved these! I bought them to go along with a soccer girl costume and they worked very well. they were soft and comfy as well as good looking.
"I am a ten that can rarely wear a 9.5 and these fit perfectly.  They were comfortable enough to get through a long wedding service, cocktail hour and the first part of the dancing reception (I was seated for dinner).  The suede is a gorgeous and rich wine color, and the craftsmanship is impeccable!  I often buy shoes online but they don't always possess the incredible quality of these.  I wore these with a gold cocktail dress, but they are also great with jeans. Very happy!"
True leather and good ventilation for peoples feet that sweat a lot. Not a cold weather slipper and toe box is wide enough for my 4e feet
Top perfect for summer...very lightweight and good for layering...
"Perfect size, it worked out well for something simple that my son wouldn't mind wearing. Although, the hat was almost useless and definitely not as nice as the one pictured."
Very comfortable. Best work pants I bought in a long time
"I have looked far and wide for a cute, lasting set of rain boots that also fit my wider calves. These fit the bill perfectly. I've only worn them for part of winter, so time will tell if they hold up for an extended period of time. As it stands, they are working wonderfully. They fit well and I can wear skinny jeans or leggings underneath without discomfort. I've already gotten multiple compliments on them!"
Can't beat this for the price. My son loves it. It shipped so very fast. I was impressed.
"My favorite shoe for 2 years running (ha!) Love the toe box, adjustability,  and how durable they've been. Will order more in the future."
"Fits perfectly. Fabric is light, and no static. Soft, and sewn together well. Great for casual work wear, as well as socially.:)"
Great for walking and running.
"I have ordered 2 of these now in a couple colors for my hubby, they are excellent quality and arrived quickly. They do need a little time to break in. Excellent price. Very stylish!"
"I wear a 7 5/8 hat and these fit me PERFECTLY.  They might be loose on some. The lenses are a great opacity... I was just walking through the woods at dusk and these kept me from squinting when the sun was coming through the trees directly at my face, but didn't get too dark when I was in the shade. Great sunglasses for the price."
"Great fit and husband loves it.  Softer with each wash, and keeps him warm."
"They are very comfortable, the wides are still a little too narrow, but it isn't that bad.  I highly recommend them."
Nice dress boots. A tide snug but they should loosen up in time!
"These are rad socks. They are knee-height and THICK. A little too thick and tall for my purposes, but that was my fault for misreading. I wear a 7.5-8 size shoe and the M's seem fine, perhaps a tad long but nothing to fuss over. Going to buy a different pair because how can you go wrong with a high-quality product with a lifetime guarantee?"
"The lace seems strong, the colors are nice, but I ordered I think 32 inches and they are too small for an adult shoe. For an adult shoe I'd probably order 42 or 46 inches next time. These I'll probably use and just not lace the shoe all the way since it's just for an extra pair of jogging shoes, but definitely order longer lace for adult shoe"
"This is a good shoe but it feels like it needs to be broken in.. The arch support is great but the shoe doesnt breathe very well and this will make your feet really hot. They aren't the most comfortable shoe but if you are going to work out in them, or keep them on for only a few hours, its a great shoe.."
"These are exactly like shown. I knew there were small, i think they hang down just the right amount. Super cute, super comfy, slept in no problem. Not super sparkly on the stones, but i still like them.

Only complaint is the leverback portion. It's really, really, lightweight / flimsy quality. Was expecting a thicker wire, these are super easy to bend out of shape so be careful opening and closing them.

Overall for the price these are a cute little casual pair of go with anything earrings."
Just what I needed to finish my costume.
I love the curls
Color is exactly as represented in picture.  This fabric is extremely soft and comfortable while still being durable.  I expect this shirt will last and get worn a lot.  Will definitely buy more in other colors. Wish the sleeves were a little tighter fitting but I still love it.
"Fit great, good quality."
Nice material but the fit is a bit snug in the waist.
"This is the first scarf that I've purchased and overall I'm happy with it. Since it is synthetic, it's not itchy and is relatively soft. The fabric isn't very thick but it has worked well so far."
"WELL-MADE AND ATTRACTIVE
THIS CLASSIC ISOTONER IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.
ALL THE COLORS ARE LOVELY AND THE GLOVES ARE WELL-MADE AND VERSATILE.
DRESSY OR CASUAL, YOU ALWAYS LOOK PUT TOGETHER FOR ANY OCCASION."
"Holds all it needs to, son loves it."
The little lady I bought this for immediately opened it and tried to spin around like the ballerina inside.  It was a total hit!
Pretty and dainty.
"My husband LOVES these socks  They are thick and warm enough to wear in his work boots.  The packaging is so beautiful, too."
"Absolutely love the swimsuit! As someone with large thighs/butt and a tiny torso, finding swimsuits can be hard! This one fits me perfectly while providing my 32DDDs with support. Would buy again."
"I bought this for my husband, and he raves.  Plus I steal it.  So soft and warm."
"Would not expect anything less from Justin Boots. Just like the pair I've worn for 8 + years.
Can expect another long lasting comfortable pair of boots."
Looks great the length is perfect it is just a little narrow if your feet are skinny you are fine but if have medium feet go 1/2 size more otherwise the high is confortable
"These are so very comfortable! Lightweight and cool. I sound TAPS quite often for military funerals, I had one yesterday. 92 degrees here with 88% humidity. And believe me-a cemetery is either the hottest place or the coldest place ever! I was hot but not terribly so. The pants are very very thin. I would not recommend a short top with these. I have a desk job, the pants hold up nicely and don't seem to stretch and pull. I usually wear 24-26 petite pants, these fit me nicely."
"Love this watch!  Packaged safe & securely & arrived on time. I am not a big wearer of watches, but this one is very comfortable. The beads/bangles & watch face are securely on the nice thick leather bands. Thank you."
"Great chef coat, fit as expected and looks fantastic."
"Comfortable, fit well, and very cute!"
It was fine but I ordered a 1.3 and it worked out better for what I wanted it for.
Great fit and very comfortable. Light on the feet.
"Haggar casual pants are the only pants that fit me well, wear well, and are a great value!"
very comfortable- give great ankle support. the laces stay in place and don't slip at all. they are a little difficult to get on and off but not a big deal.
"You get what you pay for. Sure, they're a little tight around the top of the foot, but they just need to be broken in. Very cute"
It was a gift and my son was very pleased.
It actually fits perfect and I kinda wish I went one size smaller to get more drama out of my waist line and bust. But it is comfortable and soft. Looks great too.
"As far as Bras go -- this one is relatively comfortable and supportive. Full disclosure -- I hate to wear bras and almost never do, but sometimes you just gotta do it. I bought 4 in different colors."
Lots of compliments. Love it.
These are beautiful Beads they have such a deep green color with a slight translucence I can't wait to make something with them
These jeans fit well and are well made. They didn't shrink much at all on the first washing. I'm pleased with this purchase.
"Handsome looking tie, well made, good quality. No complaints at all. It looks very nice on my husband. :)"
This was a great gift for my sister  who has a floating locket.  They just go with everything you can possibly wear.  She was so pleased and I believe her because I always see her wearing them.  She has also let me know of how many people compliment her at work.  I am very happy with this purchase.
"These. Are. Amazing. They fit true to Levis size even though they are skinnies... I expected to have to buy a size or two up but nope. They fit. Even around my ginormous calves! I would say if you are between sizes, at least in the lighter color, go down the size. They are a great weight, not light leggings but like legit jeans, and are soft and stretchy. I'm in love!"
"I have received many compliments on this watch. It is eye-catching and unique because of the see-through design. There are, however a couple of things that could be better. First, the Roman numeral for the number 4 is ""IV"", but this watch has ""IIII"". Not a big deal, but noticeable. Second, it is a bit difficult because the knob is slightly recessed into the casing. As much as this watch needs to be wound (every other day), it can be a little rough on the fingertips. Third, the blue numbers area a bit harder to see against the black background than I anticipated. Even with these minor annoyances, it is still a great value for a good looking watch."
"It's a pretty bag and I have gotten compliments on it.  My only complaint is that the inside pockets are not deep enough and things fall out of them.  On other reviews I have read on this bag people were not pleased with the outside pockets.  They said that things fell out of them because they did not have any type of closure.  I came up with a solution for this.  I sew quite a bit but this is one that takes very little skill. I purchased a small amount of gross grain ribbon the same color as the ribbon on the bag, blue thread the same color as the stitching, and a package of velcro closures.  Cut a piece of the ribbon to make a little strap, fold the edges under and sew a portion of the velcro closure on the strap and the opposite part of the velcro on the pocket.  Presto, you have a secure pocket for cell phone or what ever you want to put in there.  You can even sew two pieces of the ribbon side-by-side to have a thicker strap if necessary.  I am happy with this bag. I can fit what I need in there for everyday use and my i-Pad fits nicely also.  The weight of a cross body bag some times bothered by shoulders.  The price sure beats Vera Bradley"
"Now I have the power. It is exactly as described. If you like the lord of the ring and want to impress your friends, this ring will do that for you. The writing is engraved inside and outside the ring and you feel having the real ring except you can't disappear and that's a pitty."
"Order received quickly after purchase and the shoe is comfortable and warm.  Very good in poor weather where slipping is a issue due to rain, ice or snow.  Fully recommend them for others."
"So one fit the all works, when it do works it works."
MY SECOND PAIR--GOLDEN RETRIEVER PUPPY HELPED WEAR THE FIRST PAIR OUT!  LOVE THEM!
Cutest bag ever. I get so many compliments!
I like to carry a handkerchief with me.  These are just the right size for my purse or pocket.  I like the pale colors as well.
"This is a very nice bag, well made, with lots of wonderful details!  The bag arrived in a timely manner, in good condition, and I was pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the color! I recommend this bag, good price too!"
Great belt and really fast delivery!!
"I have a seriously bad back, and can't wear flops - even rainbows. But these shoes are comfortable! Wear them around the house and walking around the yard. They don't fix my back, but their the most comfy summer shoes I've found. Plus, they look really cool, and they're way cheaper on Amazon."
Great product.  Helps posture. Helps eat less and clothes look better. It pays off after couple months. I wore a skirt without one and i looked awesome! Gonna buy a smaller one now!!
This vest does not attract lint/animal hair that is the bane of fleece vests.  It has a nice feminine touch with the hood and fits well.  Order your regular size.  Bought one for me and liked it so much I bought one for my sister.
"This pair of dockers khaki big n tall pants are awesome !They fit great ! There is definitely quality in the manufacture of these pants. The fabric has stretch and there are about 2"" of strectch in the waist. They are very comfortable to wear. They also wash up well. These are excellent pants and I can highly recommend them ."
"Overall very comfortable, though my heel does slide out a bit. Only have worn them twice so it may be just breaking in sitll."
Nice denim newsboy cap.  Adjustable fit.  Faded denim look.
Cute top and skirt.  My daughter is pleased.
"So I am not a real heel wearer however, I wear this like a slipper.  It is very comfortable.  The sizing is exact and I am a 10 so no room for swelling.  LOL"
"The fabric of this skirt is fairly thick. I love the high-cut waistband. It's nice and stretchy, but doesn't give TOO much- you can feel that it's tight enough to have a bit of a ""girdle"" effect, smoothing you out and not leaving thong or panty lines.

Nice grey color- looks exactly. like on the pic. I'll wear this in summer with pastels, and in winter with cute tights.

I've had skirts like this before, and if you HANDWASH them, you would NOT BELIEVE how long they can last! Throw em in the dryer, and they won't last a year. The elastic will start to dry and snap. Honestly, if you have several of them, just throw them in the sink and then over the shower door- voila. They'll last at least 2-3 years. Otherwise, I give it six months. Something about these stretchy skirts... they just self-destruct. Probably because you have too much fun in them!"
I have been buying New Balance for years.  It is the only shoe that gives me the option to buy wide (2E to 4E).  They fit fine and are comfortable.  Great price at Amazon.
"True to size, very pretty ring."
"Bought one of these for my mother, as a xmas present.  I ordered the burnt olive version without knowing how it would really look, as I'm colorblind.  I knew my mother liked green, and she said this color is fantastic.  The shawl is very nice.  It is huge and amazingly soft."
Color is fine. And they are confortable
"Loved this wig!! Wore it last night to a Halloween party! I poofed it out more to and curled it, it was great!!"
These were purchased for my son and they fit great
The sizes run very big. I'm a size 10 but having read others people's comments and looking at the size chart i decided to go with a 12......big mistake i bought a bunch of them n they were all way too big. The quality of the pants are excellent though. I would get one in every colour
"This robe is so nice! It is so plush and soft. The quality is high and it arrived exactly as described.  It is a little bit large; I am 5'8"", and weigh somewhere in the low 200's (lbs). I normally wear a size 18 or 20 in clothing, and this robe gives me plenty of room, wrapping around my body well."
"Love these- soft, easy to put on and take off!"
Tremendous product. A must-buy. We bought another after this one.
These seemed a little tight for my daughter. My boys have the atwoods that fit perfectly.
Great eye catching small necklace. Very comfortable choker for my big neck. Have worn it to the pool and beach and no green !
Great organizational tool. Looks like the picture.
"Amazing deal, cute designs! They all appear to be pretty well made and sturdy."
Very nice shoes exactly as what I expected
"The Buffalo jeans styles I like are the stretchy kind as they are very comfortable and lightweight and look good. These jeans I received are exactly what I expected. However I have several Buffalo jeans and there are now two that are ripped out two more that when putting them on and pulling them up, tore in the area of the pants pockets. I can still wear them as they look like a certain style but I assume for not much longer. I still buy them though because of the fit, feel and look and it was good I found them on Amazon cheaper than in the store. If you can handle a short life and a price that is more than average jeans, then I recommend them. They are really the only jeans I wear anymore."
The dress is nice and well made -- the wig is terrible and the tiara breaks easily -- the dress can be worn way more than once and used for dress up
"Beautiful in the turquoise! Very nice quality, material! Just the right amount of sparkle.  Lots of color choices too.  Pretty whimsical pattern."
"These are great casual shoes, with just enough style to be different, but understated enough not to be mistaken for tennis shoes.  Fit is snug, as these are meant to be hybrid approach-casual shoes.  I use them for the casual part only, and love them.  Like moccasins.  Size up without fear, as they are fairly snug.  I wear size 43 EU, 9 US.  Went with 43 in this shoe, and would go with 44 if I could do it again.  Already wore them for two weeks in Europe with no issues.  Footbed is removable for easy inserts.  I will buy another pair of these when my current pair wears out."
"Very cute, but beware, they are super tiny!"
Arrived quick super cute granddaughter loves it
Nice shoe for the price. But not waterproof. Had to return.
Every body just loves my watch
My husbands favorite sandal. Very comfortable. He wears them everyday.
"Love this watch!
I alternate between my Fitbit  Charge 2 and this as my everyday watches!
Definitely Recommend"
"These go with everything, super comfy, and well made. I've never bought Jessica Simpson anything but seeing how high quality these are I'm willing to spend the extra if all her other shoes are like this."
"These are great pants, my mistake was not checking to see if they had the expand waist band, which they don't, but that was my fault for selecting Classic fit.
The return process was fast & easy."
"Beautiful twin sweater set.  Hard to find these in the stores.  Glad to fine them on Amazon.  Excellent quality and look very sharp.  I have not washed them, yet.  But, from other reviews I read, they seem to hold up well.  Worthy purchase."
"Even though the cooler doesn't hold ice and leaks everywhere, the concept of this bag is awesome! I've taken this bag to the beach twice already and will be taking it to the pool this summer. It's a nice size and holds a lot! I have two small children so it's nice to be able to pretty much carry everything in one bag without having to carry a separate cooler with snacks and drinks. You do have to have items in the cooler in order for this bag to keep it's shape or otherwise it doesn't stand up on it's own. If they could perfect the cooler part a little more, this bag would be 10/10."
My mistake should have ordered a size up but hoping will fit into soon. The material is rough but in all its a nice wear .
Love the sandals and the price was right.  I did follow the reviews that advised ordering one size larger and I'm glad I did.
True to size and so very comfortable. Loved them so much I got a second pair in another color
The earrings are even more beautiful than the picture!!
"Really cute, but definitely not the most comfortable boots ever. I am a true size 8 and they were a little bit too large (not immensely, but I wish I would have ordered a 7 & 1/2). I just wear really thick socks with them. They also scuff up really easily... but they were only $30, so I think all in all they were worth the money."
"My daughters favorite dress. Fits exactly according to their size chart, and my daughter is tall and plus-size. These dresses are so feminine, so modest and so sexy. All my daughters are wearing them and getting many questions and compliments from men and women.....and some double takes when walking down the street. Great price."
"I picked this ring up for my daughter since her birthstone is an opal.

Pros:
1. The packaging is definitely gift giving quality.  I wrapped it up in the box it came in and it looked very nice.
2. The ring is beautiful.  It is very shiny and sparkly.  The silver really shines.
3. The simulated opal is perfect and has a lot of color to it.
4. The sizing seems to be very accurate.

Cons:
1. With all the diamond issues (slavery, violence, etc.), I try to steer clear of anything that has real diamonds.  This ring does, but they are so tiny that you really cant see them.  I would have preferred they used cubic zirconia or nothing and the I don't believe it would have impacted the look at all.
2. The size of the opal is bigger than I expected.  I felt like it overpowered the blue topaz.  The ring would have had a much more delicate look if the opal had been a bit smaller.

Overall, I am very pleased with the ring.  I am interested to see how well it holds up.  I have numerous sterling silver rings that start out beautiful and quickly lose their shine (even with proper cleaning) and the stones dull.  If this happens to this ring, I will update the review."
Perfect shaping!
"I love the shoes. I bought size 6 even though I'm usually size 5 when wear flats. But when comes to sneakers, I usually go 5.5. Since they are wedges, I decided to go with size 6 so that I'm sure I will have enought room in toe area.  It works out perfectly.  Size 5.5 may have been worked out as well but I didn't want to risk it.  Size 6 is good for me too.  If they stretch over time, I'll just put in some insoles.  They are really comfortable, as the wedges aren't too high. The sneaker style(laces, padding, cushion) makes them a lot more comfortable than the regular wedges such as wedge sandals or boots. I bought a pair in gray/orange, which is actually a pretty subtle combination, not over the top or boring.  The combination goes well with many other colors too.  Amazon has the cheapest price.  I stopped wearing sneakers a long time ago.  so when my husband saw me in these Puma sneakers the first time he thought it's funny...then I explained they are actually wedges, he said cool.  I don't know why I'm telling this.... ( maybe because I'm going crazy as it's 4am and I still can't fall asleep...) I don't care what he says anyway because I don't trust his fashion sense; he always wears oversized pants with unmatched socks lol......overall, I'm enjoying the shoes, they are fun and comfortable to wear."
"Very warm and I find them quite cozy and comfortable. Seems my hairless cat does as well as he had his face smooshed in the foot, or my feet smell really good. :)

I've received several compliments and the price was better than I had found at outlet stores and malls.

My only complaint is when lacing up. It seems to take forever and it can be difficult, for me, to get the tongue to look even. So it usually takes me 2 or 3 tries to get it all lined up to where I am happy."
"This is beautiful.  I really enjoy wearing it because it isn't too hot, and my arms aren't as thin as they used to be."
I love this ring so much!
Very soft with hard bottom soles.
Nice boot. However it runs a little big I usually wear a size 9-1/2 sneaker and my other pair of sketchers boots are a 9. These I seem to need an 8. Working as an auto mechanic they get grease and oil on them and they hold up pretty well. For the price I'd def buy another pair when these wear out
love!!!!!
"No iron, easy care.  Fits my 5'1 110 pound 10 year old well"
fits good... even for my dd's!
"Bought these in prep for a trip over seas.

Been wearing them before my trip to break them in for a period or time.

Super comfortable and light, great traction.  Only concern I have is on the top of the shoe, while walking, sometime pinches my feet. It doenst happen all the time, but I suspect its only part of the breaking in process to soften the shoe a little."
"These sandals are definitely well made and very comfortable. I am usually 6.5, but ordered them 7 because there are not half sizes. I wore them during the weekend with no complaints. I am looking to wear them during our vacation trip to the Caribbean."
order down a size and these are great.
"I bought this top twice...the first time in large...because all the reviews said that the brand of clothing was generally smaller ...but I had to give away as the shoulders were too wide and bust area was much too large as well.  I'm 36a 29 39...5'4""
I liked the style soo much that I ordered again ... this time a small and it fit me perfectly...I got soon many compliments the first time I wore to work...I love it...
An it washes well...no need to iron...just hang straight from dryer...Washington mild detergent...I use woolite dark...but any similar detergent will do."
Laughs abound!
I've been wearing and loving the long sleeve version of this Dickies tee-shirt for many years.  This short sleeve version is great too!  Really appreciate the heavier weight of the material.
I love this style shirt and the material is so comfortable. I have purchased multiples in the same and different colors.
"My first two purchases of Hi-Tec were from the cheaper Flagstaff Waterproof shoe. I had read reviews saying that the shoe sizes ran small and to buy them a size bigger. I am normally a size 10 and so I bought the 10.5s. When I got those they were HUGE! I returned them (Amazon, you are amazing! I love you!) and got the 9.5 and they fit well. However, the Flagstaff felt really ""clunky"" and was just not getting a good feel from them. I then returned those (THANKS AGAIN, AMAZON!) and bought these boots. People saying that the insoles of these shoes are totally right. My calfs and arches were hurting not 30 minutes into wearing them. So I've replaced them with my own and they feel great! I love how light they are for hiking boots. They are coming with my to the Grand Tetons in a few weeks and I will update this on how they hold up. I will give these 4/5 stars because of the insole discomfort (having to buy insoles), but so far, I like them!"
Love this sweater!!! Ibrought it in the olive color and  got so many compliments! everyone was asking where I brought it! I will be buying the other colors
"good quality, no crease, wash very easily"
Love!!!!! Will be buying more. It is so hard to find thin hoops.
"nice quality. mine fit to small, had to return."
Nice material and good pocket space. I used for biking one day which the shorts are not good for but for hiking they are great.
"Very comfortable,  perfect fit, nice sole and I love the way the fabric feels  over my toes.  This slipper is not to hot or to cold the feels just right.  Thank you. Highly recommend!!!!!"
"My husband loves these shirts, They are heavy and tough, yet comfy. I buy them for all the men in my life, (husband, brother, and Dad) they all love them!"
this is beautiful.  i love it.  i bought it as a gift.  it looks way better than the picture.  my friend collects owl things.  so it was a sure hit.
Beautiful very well-made
PERFECT!  Reminds me why I love Birks!  Now i'm having to justify getting the normal leather pay for myself as well.
"Great fit, great price, very comfortable"
The product is very good quality and arrived in good condition. I would recommend this product to others. Very Beautiful.
"Rides up some, but cute."
Comfortable.  Look good.
"I bought these for my teenage son. The fabric seems soft and nice, they fit just like the product photo, and he says they are quite comfortable."
The ring arrived faster than expected. It's really cute but the only thing is that it gets caught in my clothes quiet often. Other than that it's very good for the price.
Like a piece of jewelry! Simple elegance.
"It is perfect for my work id, money and credit cards."
"Love fit and slinky fabric, but wrap top is a little too low for big chested women, I'll have to get a lacy tube top to go under."
I really like this shirt. It has the relaxed but not big fit that I wanted and wicks the sweat well. Overall a good buy.
"Was searching for a comfortable shoe to wear for interviewing in NYC after having chosen a new pair of Michael Kohr's flats for the first trip to the city.  I did not want to wear sneakers and pack pumps, so I went for flats. Big mistake.  After ten blocks the lack of support in the shoe and the 95 degree weather, causedswelling and pain.  I searched the internet for the best shoes to walk and wear to work in NYC and ecco was one of the brands that came up.  I wear an 8.5, so instead of going with 8 - 8.5, I jumped up to the 9 - 9.5 and with the strap on top, they fit well.  The cushion support is great and I don't have to worry about walking out of them as the strap does the job of keeping them in place.  These are great for every day running around.  I would recommend this shoe and to investigate their entire line."
These are great for the price.  They stay in place and I'm not afraid of them coming out .
Favorite thing
I love the earrings. Pears are absolutely beautiful! Gold part  little too thin and easy to bend. Because of the pearls quality earrings  still deserve 5 stars.
Bought this for a costume. I have large hips and it fit. Good buy.
Arrived on time. Just as described. Recommended. Looks slightly faded after just a wash or 2.
"The boots I received were a bit lighter color than the ones in the picture, but overall I love them. They have a thick enough heal/ base to not feel rocks when walking on gravel and I can comfortably wear them all day."
I expected more of a cotton sports bra. The sides are too narrow. The craftsmanship is very good.  I think as I wash and wear this the size will be less of a concern
Nice but seem to run a little larger than other Uggs
"Very nice, fairly plain and small."
Decent. Print is strong and clear and beautiful. I got the feather one. But it just looks cheap. I bought it for a business casual outfit. I wish it was a little nicer but that's okay it's great for the price
"I LOVE this scrub top! Since we have COWS that hold all of my nursing goodies, this top works great. I can imagine however, if you are a nurse that has to carry all of your supplies in your pocket, this style may not be the right choice. The black side panels are soft and flexible, the gray main fabric is soft yet sturdy (feels like it will hold up after numerous washes). I will definitely be buying more colors!"
excellent shose comfort for work and wallking
2nd pair of the cliftons I own. Lots of miles no pain!
"I was looking for a delicate long chain to put charms on. This necklace is the right length but the links are bigger than I had imagined from looking at the product picture. Still, it will do the job."
My son was happy with the gloves.
Very flattering and great price!
"I'm not sure I'd wear this outside the house but recently I fell and injured my arm. I needed something to stay warm in and this wrap is perfect. It's light, warm, and roomy.  It's easy to put on and take off. It's not elegant faux fur, it's a little cheaply looking but for a bed jacket it's 5 stars.  I even wear it to bed and so far it's retained it's fabric, not looking worn or wrinkled etc."
My husband loves these.  He wanted them for a birthday gift
"Excellent, stimulating."
Keds are my everyday go-to shoe!
"Bought this shoe from a camper store because both of the sales associates were wearing them.  They are comfortable right out of the box.  Very soft leather and the insole has support.  They are pricey and my 9 year old daughter's pair has pulls in the elastic but overall they are great.  You don't need to break them in but order a size up!  They run small, short it the width is average to narrow.  Most other campers run true to size."
"Not a maxi length as shown, it comes just below the knees, and fits a little snugger than what I like."
I like very much how it looks and feels on me
"Any shoe from Clark, in my opinion, is going to be great! Ive always had very good wear out of this brand! They look great and are comfortable!"
Bought it for a business trip and had more then enough room for a week.  Rugged design and love the turning wheels.
"Very clear lenses, crisp polarization. Frames are very light weight, but expected with the price only $14. After wearing outside in bright sun I realize that I'm squinting a bit. I wish the lenses were a tad darker. But I love the shape and they sit on the bridge of my nose well without resting on my cheeks."
Fit as expected..good quality BDU..
Lovely!
"These fit my husband perfectly, just as expected."
My man usually where's an 8.5 to a 9. After reading the reviews I ordered them in a 10. The left one is a bit bigger than the right but he loved them and claims they at every comfy.
"Very nice, liked it very much."
This is a very cute headband. It is adjustable so my daughter will be able to wear it for a long time. The headband its self did not leave marks. It looked very cute with her Thansgiving outfit.
"Super comfortable.  5' 7"", 125#.  Fit exactly as pictured on model.  Ordered two more pair in different colors.  Expect to live in these around the house this winter."
Classic style and comfy!  I want a pair in every color.
My husband passed away in June and had previously lost his original wedding band.  We were very low income but I was able to afford this beautiful band for him and we had a recommitment ceremony about a week before he passed and I had him burried wearing it with my heart in his hands.  Thank you.
Love the design  I don't really like regular uggs because everyone got it so I'm happy with this purchase.  Since it slim at the front a little exact I would of maybe ordered an 8.5 rather than an 8 which is my regular shoe size
Well satisfied.
"Great hat! Bill wasn't too short, which i find to be a frequent problem buying hats online."
Chain was just the right length and very delicate (just what I had in mind).  Shipment was correct and prompt.  Who could ask for more?!
Very nice. Will get more stuff. Wish it was just a little bigger.
Nice sox.  Fit well and feel good on.  wash well.  soft and comfy
"Love them, it came quicklyz Definatly a darker wash blue."
Love these pants!  Wish they came in more colors!
I bought this through my husbands account for my dangly earrings. Love it.
"Fit well and looks cute. I'm not super fond of the extra long length because I usually wear these under low-cut tops and they either stick out far below the over shirt's hem, or they bunch up over my waist. But they can be hemmed for an easy fix."
Nice shade of grey. Fits well.
"It fits great, my husband is 6'5"" and it fit him really nicely.  Long enough for him even which is hard to find at times"
they were perfect and recommend them to everyone that needs new sandals!
"I put off getting these for a while, thinking they just wouldn't look good for my personal style for some reason.  Now that I've finally caved in to everyone else's positive reviews, I can totally understand why.  Absolutely the most comfortable boots out-of-box I've ever put on.  I thought the crepe sole might look cheap or tacky, but it fits the boot perfectly and goes with any clothes.  Nothing but good things to say about these."
Nice and soft I love these leggings.
This dress is awesome. I am normally a 6-8 in the waist and 8-10 in the hips. The Medium fits perfect. I just ordered 2 more in different colors. I get compliments every time I wear this dress. The green and beige colors are vibrant and it looks very classy on.
"FIT GREAT AND THE MATERIAL IS EXCEPTIONALLY SOFT.
 IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE FABRIC MIX THAT INCLUDES VISCOSE AND POLYESTER AS WELL AS COTTON AND ELASTENE MAKES THE FABRIC VERY SOFT , STRETCHY,  AND WELL FITTING  DUE TO WHATEVER SHAPE IS PUT INTO THE GARMENT!!"
Great fit and feel. Love the adjustable loop on heel.  Color of blue are beautiful
I wanted a pair of Mephisto's for ages. They are a bit pricey for me unless on sale. They are so comfortable and have great support . I can wear them 12-16 hours with no problems whatsoever. If they go on sale again I will buy several pair.
Great shirt. My son loves it. Very soft and fits great.
Great slippers. Quality product
"Im 5'9 and 150 lbs, and this is slightly big on be around the armpit. The material is nice and it looks great with slacks. I just need to take it to a tailor to get it fitted."
Awesome ring......and awesome fast transaction.....
"super cute, super comfy, super great! love the wood heel contrast with the black leather - looks badass chic. very happy with these little numbers.  worn with dresses, skirts, pants, skinnies, leggings - anything!  you should get a pair :)"
"Great looking watch, great price!"
I saved a ton buying this costume.  All of our costumes end up getting lots of use.  I liked the mask especially.  This was a deal of the day and was half the price of the same one at Spirit of Halloween.
great product. Runs a little small.
"Simply put I like these better than my under armour. Everything holds perfectly without strangling, rides at ideal spots on both leg and hip. Cool & breathable. and for the price this is what I will be purchasing more of."
"Great quality shirt, I fall a bit in-between with Alternative sizing. I'm a 37 inch chest and bought a large and its a loose fit but still looks good."
"Colorful, pretty robe. Only washed once so far, I am hoping it will soften up a bit more."
"I love these cultural blouses for wearing everyday during the hot summers. They are easy to clean and nearly always look fresh.  I work in the yard, paint, wash dishes and hang out like a couch potato wearing these and then, I am appropriately covered when the neighbors come by.  Love it!"
I bought size large after reading previous reviews and they are still a bit snug but very good quality and the price is outrageous.  I love having all of the colors.
My daughter has already had many compliments on her ring.
I bought this item for a gift.  My father wanted something larger therefore I returned it.  While the money belt was in my possession I examined it thoroughly.  This product is very well thought out and nicely constructed.  I would recommend this item for anyone in the market.
Very cute. But too small for me
"These are very form-fitting.  I like the feel, though some may not.  These are not really compression type, so they are not really tight.  They are 87% nylon and 13% spandex.  There is no fly.  They have a slickness to them.  They are tagless, which I really like. At the current price, for a single pair, I think they are quite expensive.  I thought they might be hot, but they are breathable, so no issues there.  Just think you should get at least two or three pair for the current price."
Very nice sweater and a great price.
it works great for my sunglasses or I sometime stick my reading glasses in.......someone asked me where I got it.........
I love this case! It is great for most ring sizes as long as the band is not super thick. A lot better that just having rings laying around and looks very organized.
"I went through a few returns on these before I finally got a pair that fit me properly. I normally wear a size 8 but got a 7.5 and they fit me nicely. The little leather bow on the front is always coming untied which is really annoying. It'd be nice if they sewed it down or something. The shoes look exactly as pictured and are very earthy and comfortable. I would buy them again but if you have the option of going into a store and actually trying them on first, I would do it because the fitting on these is unusual."
I do like the vest but it bunches up when I sit down. To stay warm I want to keep it zipped. So it would be a great improvement it it had a 2-way zipper. I won't buy another without that. But I have to say it is cute in addition to being warm.
"I like it so much, I bought two of them, I love the color, how it fits, how comfortable it is and the fact that it lights up! AND it's TIMEX!!!!"
Love this hat. Great material!
"Beautiful.  I usually don't like flip flops that go between my toes, but on special occasions I will wear these when i am walking just a little.  I always get compliments, they are very fancy and sparkly.  Still hurt between my toes if I walk a lot but they all do.  Sensitive Toes?"
I love how these jeans fit ! The color goes with all my shoes . They catch all the eyes in the party .
Very comfortable and seams do not show.
My 13 year old Son loves them. He's a skateboarder so he has to have the shirts to go with right!
unbelievable dress for the price. bought 3 different colors
"great product, and even better price...will buy again"
"Pros: Skirt is soft and comfortable, a nice length, can be dressed up or down, folds very compactly for travel, elastic waistband (not foldover which I feel is not flattering when you already have plenty of padding in that area!)

Cons: Overpriced, very thin, unlined, kind of clingy

I will have to wear a long shirt with this to feel comfortable, but it's ok"
"I love them, they are the perfect size"
"Works Great, no stain either"
Pair of pants were awesome
"wife liked em so much bought three more pair said the soft on inside and keep her warm.
if you're looking at keepin wife warm also look at these socks (35 Below 2 Pairs Thermal Looping Socks ) got two pair for wife same result warm and soft socks"
One of my favorite rings! It's delicate looking but sturdy. It's very comfortable and I found it comes true to size. Every time I wear it I get a compliment.
These socks are incredibly soft and seem to last longer than others I've bought for my daughter over the years.  She won't wear anything else!  I buy the large size for her and they're a perfect fit (11 years old/size 4 shoe).
"So soft and so comfortable. Material is nice and thick - doesn't show any unmentionables. Length really is long but that's how i like my yoga/lounge pants. We'll see how they hold up after normal use and washing, but very happy with initial fit/color."
Love these too.  Nice 2 inch heels that doesn't bother my heel spur or planter f.
"Bought these to replace our old ones and it looks very nice it is a step up from our old one with only two wheels. Did not use it yet, so I will update this review then."
"So far i love this suit! I got an 8. Super comfy... sadly, I've only tried it on not used it yet."
"I ordered several for my elderly mom. Perfect for her. Gladly, I sized up from an XL to 2X; shes not too heavy (171) but has a belly. Theyre soft, long enough (56). Shes pleased. Would purchase again. Prompt shipping."
"Warm and cozy ""fuzzy"" socks.  Very happy with them!"
"Beanie fits well, but is not as much a neon blue, as an ocean blue. It is 2-3 shades darker than pictured (I have bought clothing off amazon before and always take into consideration computer monitor differences and lighting. But this hat was noticeably several shades darker to the point of not reflecting a ""neon"" at all). However, the color wasn't such a big deal for me and I do really like the hat and it arrived right on time, so I cannot give a bad review, merely a cautionary to other buyers."
"I bought this as my new carry-on luggage and I couldn't be happier! I have had excellent success with all of my Osprey backpacks, craig bags, and day packs and this is no exception. The build quality is excellent and the storage configuration is amazing. I can fit a ton in this bag and it does a great job of staying organized!

PROS:
-High quality materials and construction
-Easy to organize and pack a lot into
-Hideaway straps protect it for gate checking

CON:
-Attachment points for optional Daylite pack are difficult to use."
Seems a little cheaply made but it looks nice.  A solid improvement over the last wallet I purchased on amazon.
Love this wallet!! It's not too small nor too large. Holds just what I need it to. I have to keep my purses light weight because of my back & neck & this holds all I need & is not heavy. I can actually use it without even taking my purse. I ordered the purple & it's absolutely beautiful! Such a vibrant color! I highly recommend this wallet to anyone. I am very please with my purchase!!
"The blue topaz is striking.
The ring is rather flimsy lloking, I hope it is strong"
"These little gems were perfect for my wedding! In fact, I didn't have to wear a necklace because the earrings were sized right and shined beautifully.  I will be wearing these earrings for years to come (with proper care, of course)."
I loved my shirt! Loose in the right places and comfy material. I typically wear XL/XXL. I got a 3X and it was a good fit.
"Used to replace existing blousing straps, work just like the original."
"I love color so of course I love these sneakers!
After reading the reviews, I decided to order a full size up, and am glad I did.
I normally wear a size 7 shoe (sometimes a 6.5) and I ordered these in an 8.
This is a very snug-fitting shoe and even with the 8, my toe is still pushing a bit at the front (on my 'bigger' foot), however once I got them laced-up properly, they seemed OK.
I bought them for an upcoming vacation so of course wanted to try them out before then to ensure they would be comfortable, so got on the treadmill for 45 min. and all was good - no rubbing or discomfort at all.
I do like cushier inserts however, so will probably look for a good pair to replace what is already in there.
I purchased the yellow (so cute) but am now looking at also getting a pair in the powder blue."
"They're pretty good, what I expected."
I loved this shirt. It's just my style. However it was to short. I'm a taller woman so it looks odd on me.
"These shorts are great. Soft, comfortable, not too long, not too short, and fits true to size. I'm 5'6, 135 and the size 8 fit perfectly. I do wish the waist was a little lower on the shorts, but it doesn't bother me too much. They are comfortable and not shawty shawts, which is what I wanted.

Thanks, Dockers!"
Have owned several pairs of these gloves.  They are a staple for winter.  Fit great and super warm.
These pants look and feel great.
I bought this to take to the hospital with me.  It's very pretty and seems durable.  I know I'll find many other occasions to use it.
Every penny u spend on this worth it.. Very nice
"These are so much fun.  Cheap, but not uncomfortable, and they are hinged.  Decently dark for blocking bright sun."
"I am so happy to find this style of Crocs shaped like a normal clog, not the original Croc clog  which is bulky and duck-foot shaped.  It is light-weight, comfortable and very durable, a perfect round the home kind of shoe.

Size-wise, depending on shoe I can wear a 9.5 or 10.  I used the link on this listing to the sizing guide which said I needed a 9.5.  Too small.  I just received the size 10 and it is just right.  I'll be ordering more colors."
great fit conferrable ware ever day
"I get compliments on this vest EVERY time I wear it. I have even started seeing variations of it on Pintrest under style watches. This product is fantastic quality and I would definitely recommend anyone contemplating this purchase to go for it, you won't be disappointed."
"we got several colors, very sexy fit.  Perfect at LS clubs."
"Seldom do I say that something is too big, but this top is a bit more than I bargained for.  I will still make it work, but when I order it again (because I'll get the other colors), I'll order a size smaller.  :-)"
CUte idea.
This dress is a bit of a swing dress and super comfortable and classy.
"Cute. Material is slick, not like cotton, if that's what you're expecting."
"Way better than I expected. Super warm, comfy and stylish!"
Love it! Super cute. Had a slight wardrobe malfunction so it's important to be aware!
Love the ring.  Will wear it often
These are the only shoes my son wears! He loves them and will wear them on stage when he receives his doctorat!
"Excellent product! Fit was perfect, an additional nosepad was provided, together with cleaning bag and hard case
The Prizm lens is really very clear and this is the pair I will use for running and cycling now..
love the Green Fade color which is a limited edition color created for Rio Olympics 2016"
"Same as the pink ones.  Fit well, wash well, look adorable!  No weird smell like other reviews state.  So cute!"
"Loved this outfit for an all White party. Only thing is that it's cut low and if you have a small chest, I would recommend getting it sewed up a little."
"Cute gift! The directions were clearly explained. There were three colors of included paint that would each easily make two hand prints. So you can have your child use their favorite color to make two hand prints, or I had each of my three sons make a hand print in a different color. My husband was thrilled when he opened the shirt to see his three sons' hand prints on the Best Dad shirt. It has held up well through several times of normal washing and drying. This plain white shirt would be better if it was thicker cotton, but it made a perfect gift for dad."
"Beautiful, jewels are large and beautifully shaped. Does not look cheap!"
"Reviewed by my wife: The fabric is substantial without being rough or stiff. Very nice look and feel. The dark wash denim is really attractive. Almost black, but still in the blue spectrum. The waist band sits right on the hip bones, which I like very much. I don't do well with pressure at my waist, and it's not problematic at all. The cut is more like a trouser than legging or jegging. I'm a little thick in the waist, and proportionally standard in the thigh (just a normal-type shapely there, not very straight or very curvy), to give you a frame of reference. The fit on these is not snug in the thigh, not gaping either, with a nice taper to the ankle. The inseam is probably about 32"", maybe a little more. I'm 5'11"", and I DON'T wear pants that are too short. These are  not. I would say that a much shorter person would probably need to hem them, or wear them with heels. For me, they were long enough to wear with flats, no question - and probably okay for a moderate heel. Flat footed they'll touch the floor in the back. Very happy about that.

The one thing that I didn't love is that the tush has a tendency to pull down a little, like they'd be better for someone with a flat derriere. I wore them for a couple of hours before I had to change into something else to go to a meeting, and I'd say I tugged them up into place 4-5 times in that time. For me, it's not a deal killer, because the comfort and styling combo is too hard to get this good elsewhere; but because of this minor issue, I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars."
Cute but a little wide so my foot slid forward.  But I have a slender foot and wanted to wear tights.  Might be better under other circumstances.
"This suit is great! I have a long torso and I'm also 5'9"" so one pieces tend to be hard for me but this one is great! Love the boyshort bottoms and retro style. Totally looks like something out of Sandlot. Great quality and has held up well, one of my favorite suits. Only thing is that I would recommend washing BY ITSELF before wearing. I wore it and it dyed my skin a reddish pink. Not only that but it stained my underwear from rubbing off my skin! I would be concerned about washing it the first time with other colors as they might end up pink LOL so wash it by itself before wearing and you should be good to go."
"The graphite is a great color and the pants are nice and sturdy. Slim and sexy. I love these. One drawback is the giant leather stamp on the back displaying the size-- kind of awkward because they are pretty slimming but they declare their size! Just take it off. My boyfriend has been wearing skinny levis for years, and he likes to roll these up which looks a little silly. They aren't as slim as the skinny ones-- slightly bulky in boots."
Nice heavier material than the cheaper brands I've tried. Never shows wrinkles out of the dryer. Feels more dressy than others. I've worn these both in Summer and Winter.
"I got the wide for the first time and they feel so much better than the regular width.
I'm very happy with these."
These are now my son's favorite pajamas.
Cute shirt. Even better in person. Details are so cute!
"Are you sick of those cheap, uncomfortable Wall-mart shoes that make your feet feel terrible after five- minutes of wearing them? If you are Toms are the perfect shoes for you! Toms are supper comfortable and cute , you can wear them in the summer or winter. They are made with canvas, with and arch support on the inside.
 Toms come in a lot of different styles and patterns. You won't have the same Toms as somebody else because they are all so different. Toms are fifty dollars that's a little pricey but, some of the money buys a little kid in need of shoes Toms. So it's worth it!
 I like Toms because they are comfortable. When we went to Disneyland we had to walk around a lot. I was the only on e in my family wearing Toms. All day everyone was complaining about how much their feet hurt, and my feet didn't hurt at all! Me and my friends all have toms we all wear them all the time! You can wear Toms anywhere, to school to a football game anywhere you want! If you are looking to be in style and comfortable then these are the shoes are the shoes for you!"
Classic tagless white t's. Good price.
"I got these for my very sensitive 4 year old. She is petite, but likes her clothes loose, and very comfortable and soft. Just be aware that you may get a different pattern than pictured. We received peace sign designs (in green, pink and orange) which she liked anyway. It's really hard to find true-to-size very comfortable underwear, so I hope these will do the trick."
Great and resistant!
"Harley makes the best boots.  Strong, durable, and stylish. I will buy again and again."
My foot is average width.  These boots fit very tight for whatever reason.  Never had this issue with any other Timberland boots.  They are waterproof and very warm.  I've stepped in puddles of slushy snow and my feet remained dry.
"I bought this for a week-long trip to Iceland because it looked like I could carry it on if I zipped off the 15L attached pack. I was able to carry it on without challenge, but on smaller aircraft had to gate check while on larger aircraft (767) had to turn it sideways to fit in the overhead bin. On the way home, with gifts, it was stuffed and heavy so I decided to check it once I got back in the states for the last domestic leg of my itinerary. I flew American Airlines domestically to the connecting US international airport, where I picked up IcelandAir. Im a tall female (68 inches) with a long torso so the mens version is fine for me and with the adjustability it was comfortable and easy to use. The full open zipper (rather than stuffing the thing from the top) made getting to my gear easy without always having to unpack then repack. The zip-off pack was convenient and also easy to get things into and out of without necessarily having to unpack and then repack to get a specific item out. It was a great day pack on the trip. The whole thing is low profile compared to other packs and especially book backpacks. I have the reddish colored version and checking it got it a little dirty, but spot cleaning was easy and it held up (no scratches, picks, or tears). I looked at the smaller version (40L) but Im glad I got the 55L instead with the judiciously selected winter gear I needed and saving a little room for gifts (I squashed an Icelandic sweater into it for the way home). I recommend this backpack. Its roomy (all things considered), and allows flexibility."
I love this Wallet. I also ordered a Giraffe Print Large Bucket Purse and this Wallet goes great with it other then the fact the reds are just a little shy on matching but that's ok. The only problem I have with the wallet is the snaps. When you try to use the first snap that makes the wallet a little wider it doesn't like to fold to that wider width but after a little coaxing it will work but I think it could be a little more supple in that area instead of stiff and hard to work with but other then the one problem I have with it I love how much room the wallet has. It doesn't just have one place for my extra cards behind the card slots it has 2 separate pockets so I can place either my cash there or any extra cards I may have that didn't fit in the card slots. Most wallets I have used when I go to place my drivers license in the clear slot when I go to take it out I have to fight in order to get it out but this slot has just the right amount of give to it so its easy in and easy out. A great little wallet for the price. Highly recommend. A+++
"Owned  hi-top Reeboks in size 7m over twenty
years ago and am happy to say that these sneakers fit perfectly and are seem  as well made as in the past."
"On delivery I tried it on & it seemed a bit large but not large enough that I couldn't use it.  It's too heavy to return despite who's paying the freight.  It will work for me.  Typical Carhartt it's very well made, but pricy.  Available locally for a bit less even with sales taxes."
"We really love our Oakiwear rain suits. Both of my boys have one and they've been fantastic for snow play for our Utah winters. With wool base and fleece under neath, these keep the snow out of pants and let my boys go crazy in the snow. My oldest has said over and over that he loves his Oakiwear when he's sledding because snow doesn't get everywhere when he wipes out.

My ONLY complaint is a small one, I wish they made these well into kids size 12. My oldest is 7 and is wearing the 8/9 and I doubt he will still fit it next winter."
True size fit well
Ordered came very quickly and was the exact hat I was looking for my husband.
I rocked this till it broke lol but thats another review not for Amazon!  This top fit fabulous and it definitely dressed up almost any bottom!
I absolutely love nine west shoes and these are no exception. The platforms make them ultra comfortable. Very elegant and classy shoes.
Really comfortable and I love wearing it with a long sweater and eggs.
i bought these for my mom and she loves them they should come in colors
I bought this for my 2 grand daughters so they have a place to put their newly pierced earrings in so they don't lose tyhem. The can see through the glass and pick out a pair to go wth thier little ouftis
"Love this coat. It's warm, comfortable, stylish, and has an inside pocket. I can't believe I was so satisfied with a coat purchase online!"
"Excellent belt, looks great and feel like a good quality belt."
"Great costume! My fianc wore it for our halloween party. It fit great and the quality was good too. Most halloween costumes bought at the halloween store are made of a cheap material, but this costume didn't rip or tear at all (after his whole night of drinking lol)."
I love these socks. They are hard to find. They came quickly and are very beautiful.
"Cute hat, just didn't like it on myself, jealous of those that can pull of hats and be able to keep it."
worked great for my 16yr old cousin. True size medium
"The leather on these shoes is so soft and color is great. They are very comfortable, I love them."
great strong quality
"I love my charm!! It fits on my bracket perfectly. Every time I look at it, I'm reminded of how much I love my country!"
Wore for a costume. It was a little large on my head and that made it perfect!
"The dress looks just like the picture. I'm surprised at the quality. The material feels very comfortable and the dress fit my mother perfectly. She's normally a size 6-8 and I ordered her a 10. Guessing the asian size vs american size. The dress is actually very nice and elegant, not flashy."
"Great product for those HIMYM enthusiasts, especially to those who worship Barney. The tie is definitely a conversation piece and just overall feels and looks great."
"I like it , I purchased all colors , setup was easy without instruction and the shipping was 1 week , working as expected and i like the mirror hehe playing with the sun outside and my cat lol"
"Love the color, and the style is so unique.........great shoes"
Back chair fragile.  Need the end loops tightened.  This is a piece that will be talked about.
I wear a size 6 and a medium fits perfectly! Very happy with skirt!
These are well made boxers.  My 14 year old son loves them.  The fit is as described in the sizing chart.
Fit good. Large is for really big ears. I recommend medium for med to lg ears.
thick material keeps me warm
These jeans are not 99% cotton. The tag inside reads 73% cotton 27% polyester. The jeans to look nice and fit well. I did look at the label of jeans I currently had on prior to trying these on (Nine West Vintage America) and the label read and looked the same but are a lot heavier material. Some comments are that these are not like Levis used to be and they are not but as I'm finding out not much is. I was really hoping these were at least 99% cotton which is super hard to find but I do think these will make a nice pair of summer jeans. I don't regret buying these jeans.
Super comfortable and nice support.  Love it.
Very comfortable and provides good cold protection. Easy to wear under jeans.
"i used to wear 9.5 and i bought the same size which is 9.5 and it fits perfectly , so nice and very good quality"
"The body fits really well, it's just too short for me. Others may like it."
"Very wrinkled but nice
The blue isn't a powder blue its more of a turquoise or ocean bright blue."
"This is my go-to shirt.  It's very comfortable and goes great with leggings and boots. I wear this shirt more than I should, therefore I plan on buying more in every color."
"I purchased this dress, I was nervous since I read some of the reviews and the sizing is so different, I purchased a size 3x I wear a 16. It's fits great, I am smaller in the waist I will probably get it altered, the fabric is beautiful the skirt is fill and the style is classic. I would recommend this dress to anyone who loves a classy vintage look.  Simply Amazing"
"my 7 yr old niece loves Hello Kitty.  So, I was very pleased when I received this free for review.  The soft silky bag it comes in is very nice. The necklace itsself is perfect for a young girl. It is solid, very sturdy, and beautifully crafted. It has just the right amount of ""bling"" with out being gaudy. The chain on this necklace, is strong, and thicker than you'd expect. Over all this is a perfect gift for a young girl who loves hello kitty."
My nephews love superhero pajamas. Big hit. They wear them all the time.
Great present for the kids and friends!
These are by far the most comfortable flip flops I have ever worn. The black obviously gets a bit warm in the sun... but very comfortable and holds up well to salt water and sand.
"Really cute, fit my 13 mos old son really well."
Comfortable hardly know I have it on. Lots of shine
Bought to wear as a pinky ring.  Looks great alone or stacked with other rings.
Like the color and purchased three the black and blue as well.like the feel and the color goes well with just about all of my suits
I wear it a lot. They feel like pajamas!
"It seems big, but good quality"
Good looking and comfortable fit
"These are nice, the pockets aren't very deep though. This to make makes them difficult to wear casually."
"I purchased these screwdrivers to size the band on my Omega which has tiny screws instead of push pins.
They worked great, were very inexpensive and come with a complete set of replacement blades."
"Ha ha, my husband loves this.  We got a good laugh over it when it arrived because it' so long.  He has a bad back and it saves him the pain of having to use a shorter one.  Great product.  Heavy duty and very helpful for anyone who cannot bend down easily."
these fit better on 'some days'...as all things seem to.  I like the way they're cut.
The toe box is a little tight but i expected it to be. Having a pair similar to this sandal but without the ankle straps. Having stretched the edges of the toe box make the sandal fit better for me . It's a nice style sandal and a good stable foot bed.
"I've had these sandals over 2 years now, and love them. I've walked through lake mud, across coral and volcanics in Hawaii, as well as on the airplane(they're easy on/easy off).
The only place not to use these sandals is on long walks - there's no arch support."
"I had to laugh when I received this. It was all by itself in the box with a couple of packing plastic bubbles that only took up 1/3 of the box. The strange thing was the rattling inside as I was carrying it in! See the picture with the box cover under the bottom of of the box? That is how it arrived! No one bothered to put the cover on the box. The tool and 9 of the twelve bits were just  rolling around in the box under the flaps, wherever. The tool box was undamaged (fortunately so were the tool and bits).
  So I could not turn the adjusting screws for either the top or the bottom until I sprayed on some WD40. Then everything worked fine. With enough fussing to get the top pins at the right width and the bottom snug, I got the watch open, replaced the battery, and closed the watch. So it worked well for me."
So darn cute! Using for a Halloween costume then with outfits for winter.
This is my 4th pair of M Mooz and I love them all..great quality..instantly comfortable and unique style. Highly recommend!!
"Fit to just below the knee on a girl that is 5' 7""."
"The title says it all.  It's beautiful, sparkly, and the perfect size.  It's not too big and not too small and I love that there is both a long and short strap, because I typically need my purses to be cross body (even the long strap is super sparkly!).  I can't even describe how sparkly this purse is...it's just too amazing.

The bag is very well put together, and has feet on the bottom which gives it structure.  It also comes with a cloth bag for storage.

The mini gambler tote is definitely a pretty penny, but oh so worth it.  So so worth it."
"Been looking everywhere for blue boots.  These are warm and comfortable.  I did spray with Scotch Guard after reading all the complaints about not being waterproof - I don't plan to wear them in deep snow or rain but sprayed just in case.  They go great with jeans - I would order again in a different color if I needed any more boots,  Very cute and easy to get on and off but don't slip when walking like my Uggs do.  They are pretty light weight so your feet don't get tired wearing a heavy boot - I usually take shoes off right when I get home but find myself wearing these because they are so light, warm and comfortable."
"They're Levi's (one of the sexiest jean on the planet)!
Great fit.
The end."
use them all the time
It looks like a more expensive dress.  I wore on my Birthday and all my Family and Friends just loved it.
"I really liked the shoe. Smart looking and sophisticated, Unfortunately the shoe runs really large."
"great shirt, very thin and slightly tapered fit.  Extremely comfortable and the logo has stayed through multiple washes."
"I have never had a problem with playtex bras. They do what they advertise. They hold everything in and shape/lift me where I need it. And, they are very comfortable."
Love them but they are tiny.  No room at all for growing.  If thats what you like in baby fit go for it.
"Where has this been all my life? When I first put it on, I realized I hadn't bothered to figure out how to release the clasp, I was mortified! After a little bit of panicking I found the lever on the top (or bottom) of the buckle :)  I love that there are so many notches in the ratchet that simply cannot be available on a ""standard"" belt.  A couple of things to note: The belt buckle is a little heavier than normal so if you hang your pants up at night as I do, expect the belt to slip out sometimes. Second, you can't see it on this belt but the end that threads through the belt loops is more square than tapered making it more difficult to align; I'd try to get something more tapered next time.  Looking forward to my next one, too!"
I think the sizing is a bit off and runs much larger than the sizing chart. I wear a size 12 and ordered a large and it fits perfectly. Not too tight. I like to show my hourglass shape but not every curve on my body so this was perfect! I also like that it's longer so it covers your rear when you wear leggings. It could be worn as a dress. If you follow the washing instructions these wash beautifully.
"I was really shocked that buying a pair of shoes on the internet could be so easy. These are not only very well made and better than i had hoped for, the prices are better than reasonable and the shipping time was spectacular. They came in a very durable plastic bag but why not? The shoes are rubber and don't need a lot of packaging. These are so comfortable. I really am amazed. I wanted something to be easier on my ankles and legs on my hard tile kitchen floor. That is where i spend the better part of my days. I got these in black but will probably get lots more in other colors as well. Great customer service!!!!"
"Looked nice but returned them because they were too large in the heel area, however, I have smaller than average heel. I wear a 9.5 and ordered a ten."
"I am very happy with them.  The color, size and quality are all good."
"These are good, but just might be knock offs. Since Im not sure, they did something right. Not bad for $30"
I love this dress!!  It fits perfectly.  The material is great and contours very well to my curves.  I would highly recommend this dress.
"This is a frosted white rain poncho by Aircee that you wear over your normal clothes so you don't get your clothing wet. The material is pretty thin so its not meant to work a coat. The material used is similar to PVC but is not PVC. Rather, it is made of EVA which is an environmentally friendly material. The white material is sheer and partially transparent so your clothing can still be seen underneath.

Because the material is thin, a bit thicker than a plastic shopping bag, the material can be caught and scratched if not careful. However, it can still be reused quite a few times before its disposed. The hood is a good large size so it can efficiently cover the whole head and more. I like to wear a high ponytail and many hoods don't cover the entirety of my head due to the extra bulge of my hair.  You can also use the strings to cinch the hood around your head.

The buttons are plastic snap closure and reach to the middle of my calves. The rain poncho is lightweight and can be folded up for storage. It is very roomy so even if you are wearing a lot of layers, this can still fit well.

This rain poncho is practical and not very stylish or fashionable, but when its pouring outside and I don't want to look worse for wear at an important meeting, this is a helpful and super important item to have on hand. It can be easily folded into a tiny square and stored in a plastic bag and then stored in my purse. I received this rain poncho at no cost for testing and use and this is my honest and unbiased review."
Ordered for my son for Christmas who ears and XL since there was no XL to Select I chose the 1X big . The shorts are very nice I like the style Im sure he will too and I know they are supposed to be baggy but they are pretty big. Might have been able to get away with a Lg not sure. All in all would order again wish they had more colors.
"love the loafer, love the color---brown loafers in the perfect size heel are hard to find---"
"A good deal, you deserve"
I love these Nautica T-shirts they fit well an look great.
"This necklace is exactly what I was hoping it would be.  I think it might be an inch longer than 30"" as described in the advertisement for it.  It's perfect for my pendants that are also yellow gold without taking away from their luster at all.  A 2mm thick chain is exactly the thickness I wanted.  I was a little bit worried about buying a 10k yellow gold necklace online but, knowing Amazon from previous purchases, I shouldn't have been at all!"
"This is a very sexy and flattering dress for dinner or party. I'm 5', busty, curvy and I got a size medium. I got large in the color GREY but because the dress is stretchy, medium worked well. It will show all areas of the body but the color black makes it flattering."
"Beautiful scarf! Small and triangle in shape, but plenty big enough!  I have a new Great Granddaughter coming in November, and it will be just perfect"
"love the fabric and style, and the fact that star vixen has finally created a garment that's not too small.  their plus sizes are the main too-small problem.
  I ordered a different star vixen long dress (same fabric) in 3x and then the same dress in a xl and measured them together. they were the same size.  both fit.  maybe I can come over here with the thin gals to order their dresses- cool!
 have purchased the  turquoise and coral.  the coral is more orange than pictured."
"Good mittens for getting the baby's hands covered easily. I wish the cord was just a tad bit longer, but other than that they're great. Good quality and wash well."
Great looking and Versatile bag!  I use it to carry my iPad Mini and chargers.
Perfect match for my necklace. Thank you!
"These aren't my favorite bottoms, but they are cute and fit very well!  For reference, I am 5'4 and around 132, and the mediums fit great. I think a large might fit also, but it would likely sag or fall off if doing anything more active in the water."
"It's cute but the stitching around the neck and right shoulder is off a little. Im 5'3 between 160-168 lbs; I ordered a large and it fits just right. The lady from Amazon who delivered my package literally threw my package at the door, she didn't even knock. Had I not been in my living room, I wouldn't have even known."
"Being 5'2"" 100 lbs I struggle finding clothes that fit me without needing alterations. This top is perfect for me, very easy to dress up or down. The material is great quality, I am very surprised how little it costs. The sleeves are easy to roll up or down, and the buttons are hidden behind another layer on the lapel. A great amazon buy!!!"
Had a girls night out coming up but no time to go to the mall and so glad I found this dress. It is super sexy and fits so good. I am 51/125 and got a medium and it fits so well. The material is so soft and easy to wash.
fits as expected very cute on
"Woks very well, easy to use and quick, would purchase again."
"Great dress! Love the ruffles!

I had a wrap dress once before but it was cut all wrong and not very flattering (I was also smaller and less busty, so there is that.
It's really meant to celebrate your shape, not cover it in a stiff layer of fabric. So, while the fabric is on the thin side and only printed on one side, leaving it feeling a bit unfinished, I was still pleased! I kept twirling around the living room in it after trying it on for my husband (who loved it).
I got the ""Parisian peach"" print, but it is definitely more pink, less nude or peach which I expectedly am 5'2"" and 20 jeans - I got the 2x and the fir was excellent - of course the fabric is stretch. It is not see through. Hits around my knees in front and about mid calf in back. Ruffles all over when you walk! I will probably use a mini safety pin at the bust to be sure there are no slippage issues.
I will likely purchase again in this brand/size/material.

[edit] no safety pins needed! Would love this in a shorter version and more sophisticated print. I font a lot of the kiyonna clothes to have odd prints and colors I would not be comfortable wearing, particularly to work - this one really pushes the limits."
My son loves his sandals. He wants to wear them all the time and prefers them over his Stride Rite sneakers. So even in the winter he wears his sandals. He always wears socks with them.
Nice sleeping goon
"Good quality, but they changed the fit from the Speedcross 3. I have gone back to the 3s for everyday wear."
"Sometimes you don't really want to wear a full cami under certain types of shirts, These little clip on cami-look inserts are perfect for the coverage needed.  Being petite, many blouses are too low cut for me and I wear these a lot."
Pretty good.  The case it comes in is pretty weak but its functioned well.
"This is my ""little"" backpack for traveling.  It fits perfectly under even very small airplane seats, holds everything I need and is distinctive enough that there is no doubt about whether or not it is mine.  There are just enough pockets: a ""sunglass"" pocket that I use for emergency travel medicines, and two front pockets which are deceptively large.  The laptop pocket is accessed by it's own zipper (corner and side access instead of top) and only holds one laptop.  The main compartment is reasonably sized.

I receive many complements about how attractive this backpack is."
"I'm a big guy and I often work on-site at different locations where business casual is the minimum dress code.  I'm an IT contractor, so I often have a bag full of usb cables, external devices, legal pads, laptop, etc. and sometime to ge tto my destination requires long walks in overly heated office buildings.  These shirts are great because they breath and are cool even after a 1/2 mile trip to an assignment through skyways, streets, stairways and elevator trips in an overheated office building.  If you have to dress  business casual, but want to still be comfortable and look good, these are a great choice."
What a great buy! The material feels great and its very comfortable.  I have 3 colors and looking at getting the solids
very nice  earrings they were just as advertised
"Love love love Bobs, nothing bad all good!"
smaller fit that expected.  soft plastic.  comfortable and no cracks yet.  farming really does a number on these type boots - will check back in months to see about wear and tear.
Boots just arrived. I ordered two pair. They fit perfectly. I read the other reviews first so I did size up. They don't have a funny smell they seem warm and best of all they came way ahead of schedule. I'll be ordering a few more pairs this week.
Very nice just didn't work for my dress
Bought for Work during the holidays and LOVE this dress. I'm 5'11 and normally a size 6-8 so i ordered a Medium and it fits like a glove. Definitely recommend MUXXN! I have purchased 4 dress from them so far and LOVE all of them!
okokokokokok
"Awesome. Just what I wanted. They also fit my wide foot right out of the box with minimal need to break them in. Overall, very pleased with this purchase. Thanks!"
Total awesome.
Love love love these boots!! Super cute with leggings and a dress
Nice. awesome
"Amazing style, fit, comfort!!"
"Can't go wrong with white Air force 1. Love, love love. Perfect!"
"Fits lovely and as expected.
Buying my next pack soon"
"Perfect and Beautiful!!!
Broke while wearing it the first time, the company was really nice and cool by sending me another."
"My wife loved this pair of jeans. They fit perfectly and the quality is excellent. They make a
perfect gift."
"I've been trying to explain to my small fry that what a shoe has on it and if it lights up is secondary to how long it lasts, if it is comfy, and if it helps him run fast and jump high!  He is less convinced.

However, after the Thomas shoe debacle of 2013, the 'how long it lasts' bit is essential :P He is fairly hard on shoes, and am usually a See Kai Run mum, but the begging wore me down -- hence that unsavoury Thomas business. I vowed Never Again, and went looking for something that might please both of us.

I was delighted (seriously, I squealed) to find a leather, sturdy-looking, comfy, trusted brand shoe in FIRE TRUCK with LIGHTS? Shut the front door! My joy was totally eclipsed by my son's delight :)  He's a picky little tiny hipster and I was really afraid he would be disappointed, especially with having to wait a few days before they arrived. No such concerns.  He was thrilled with the look, I'm thrilled with the quality... I'd say it's a win.

The extra added awesome on top: the lights blink in fire-truck pattern.

You can't lose with these shoes. Seriously."
"It's made very well, holds it's shape and doesn't stretch out. Was exactly the color I expected from the picture. Runs a tiny bit small. I just ordered one size up to be safe. And that fits well."
"I love this shirt. I'm a fan of The Walking Dead and comfy t-shirts, so this shirt is perfect for me."
Nice long sleeve thermal to ride on my motorcycle with would recommend
"I love these jeans.  The are soft and very comfortable, has a little give at the waist.  Great buy"
"I worry about them lasting through the winter properly.  But they are everything I expected, plus they are very comfortable.  Great to wear for business or to a night out."
I as week every other day and this swim suite is with me. It  fits perfectly and stretches a long with my belly  grow.
Love it!  Thanks
I wanted these for spring and summer they are cool for the warm weather and look nice to go shopping.
"Fun got a pair in classic ""Who Me Trashy?"" grey.... have popsicle pink ones in my shopping cart., take my single girl self up a notch. Awesome with a lycra tank top and push up bra on a hot day.... if you are that kind of girl, which I proudly am... reasonable shipping speed... Decent novelty type item in terms of quality... I like the high draw string waist... a cute old school accent."
"These are great if you don't want to spend $100+ on a nice pair of boat shoes. Wish the sole was a different color, and they fit a-bit large, so make sure to get the exact size of your foot, not a little bigger, and not a little smaller."
i love it. i'm usually a medium and it fits perfect.
Muy buena campera.
"Superior quality! Always last a solid 2 years.  Coming from a hunter, fisher, and a first responder, BUY THESE DAMN BOOTS!!"
"Very comfortable, and waterproof. Theyre perfect for hiking the Washington trails"
"Easy to put on and comfortable.  Look good, too"
"Absolutely love the fit, fabric and style.  More than happy with the purchase!!"
"My daughter needed a summer shoe to wear with her graduation robe. A wedge or flat was required since no heels are allowed on the artificial turf. This is a pretty shoe, fit her slender, long foot well, is sturdy and had a bit of shimmer than went well with her gold robe."
"Always apprehensive about buying shoes online as shoes for my feet range form size 10 to 11. However, these are spot on as far as sizing and are comfortable. For the price, these are quality boots and I feel they are on par with more expensive boots."
Got the new size and I LOVE them
"Don't be a cheapskate bast mate.
Buy 1, 2 or 3 in different colour."
perfect size for everything you need safe and not killing your back
"Nice looking, good quality.  My husbands only complaint is that it is a little short.  When he lifts his hands above his head, it goes way above his belly button.  To fix, I plan on sewing a tshirt to the bottom to look like he has a tshirt on underneath as many of them do.  Probably would still buy it again even though short.  Fits absolutely fine otherwise."
I have had cheap sleepers in the past.  I live in MN so everytime I would go outside my feet got wet.  These are very warm and I can step out on my driveway with a little bit of snow and not get my feet wet.  Really happy with them.
"I have to admit, I needed help getting everything in place, but with help from hubby, all is fine. It's comfortable, and not ""hot"" like I expected."
This was a gift for a twelve year old female who totally loves these boots. The quality and workman ship is obvious.
"Like walking on a cloud.  I'm one of those people whose feet hurt all the time - until I found these shoes.  The inside is cushioned and the tread is soft as well.  My feet have thanked me many times for purchasing these shoes.  I wouldn't recommend them for outdoor use as asphalt and the like would probably tear the soft tread up pretty quickly.  I wear them inside on a linolium floor.  I've been wearing my current pair for ten months.  The sole does show wear, but they're still remarkably comfortable.  I do have a second brand new pair in a box waiting for my current pair to wear out and will probably by more spares to put away for future use out of fear these may some day no longer be available.  I have never ever had a more comfortable pair of shoes.  I did find the sizes to run a little small and had to go a size bigger than I normally wear.  I recommend going to your local store and try them on and find your correct size and then buy them here for the best price."
"Very nice quality. Be warned, the pants are more of a slim fit. Ended up wearing the jacket with another pair of pants already owned."
Fits well.  Washed well.  Very pleased.
Loved it. Sheer and light.
Definitely will be buying more as needed. Very good quality.
Nice to find a source of many bright colored mens socks.
I like the pants but they fit a little tight and the fly button hole is a beast to get the button through.
"Great shoes, always have been.  They do run large but converse always have so be careful of that.  The optic white is awesome for personalizing, i buy about 3-5 pairs per month that i draw on and sell and they are always great quality.  Compared to vans however it is a courser canvas so you do have to spray them prior to drawing on them to give a more even surface"
Love it! I bought it to tie dye it and it turned out awesome!
"This was a replacement for a similar bracelet I lost,  Because it stretches it would fit anyone - it is a little loose for my small wrist, but I like it that way.  The crystal beads and hematite are beautiful"
This hat fit my large/extra-large head with a little room to spare.  You can tighten the fit with the cords.  I like the venting all around the hat.  It seems that a little breeze will cool you without getting a burn.  It's definitely better than a baseball cap.
These earrings look great and have stood up to several months of near daily use. They still look new; no tarnishing.
"They are PUMAs they feel comfortable, but tend to run 1/2 a size too small or a full size if you have narrow feet."
"larger than others that I have found after purchasing, but overall, worked perfectly for the occsion"
"I recently had corrective eye surgery [PRK], and my eye doctor said I need to find a pair of polarized sunglasses to protect my eyes from UV light. (During the healing process, it's extremely important to protect your eyes from UV so the cornea's don't become scarred).  Searching for sunglasses is a nightmare!  Prices range from hundreds of dollars to just a few dollars.  I wanted polarized and HD and found these glasses on Amazon.  I'm a prime member, but these weren't eligible for 2 day shipping, however, shipping was free through the company.  Much to my surprise, the day after I placed the order, I got them!  FANTASTIC!  They are everything I was hoping for!  GREAT sunglasses!"
These are the best winter boots I have ever owned! So comfy and warm. I got half a size bigger so I could wear thick socks and they are perfect.
"I thought the costume was great, but my son wouldn't wear the main part of it because it kept falling off his shoulders."
Use them for slippers
Protect your feet from hot concrete and enjoy water aerobics or the water park.
Shirt is really good Quality and on the thick side and the print color r is vibrant and well made. Its a little on the bright side.
"I have another pair of the Chippewa service boots in crazy horse and had to get these when they were on sale during black Friday. They fit exactly like my other pair and have broken nicely after just a few wears. I normally wear a 9.5 in dress shoes and tennis shoes, but when it comes to boots I wear an 8.5. These boots will only get better with age."
"For the price, you can't go wrong with these. This product came up when I was searching for maternity tanks, but they're just really long and stretchy. The material is a little thin if you want to wear them on their own, but they're great if you're using them to layer. I am 7 months pregnant and these are long enough to cover my belly and still go to just under the fly on my jeans."
Good quality feel with the material and a snug fit like I was looking for. I worn this a couple times already to the beach and just around the island. It serves its purpose from protection from the sun and dries quick as well. I would recommend this product.
SO CUTE! Love this dress on my teenage daughter.
"These are a great product, best pair of boxer briefs I own by far! I wear them hiking and they keep me cool and well supported"
"On the actual received no photos,"
"I really like this necklace and like that it matches earrings with the same style. It can roll around and get caught a bit but otherwise, it's pretty and hangs in just the right spot."
"I think this ring is beautiful and am very happy that I bought it.  It is very shiny and sparkly and looks nice on my hand.  I've received quite a few compliments, too."
Best approach shoe I've worn.  Perfect arch support too.
These boots are super cute. I have them in tan and black and get compliments whenever I wear them. The only downside is that they aren't as comfortable as some of my other booties. My feet hurt by the end of the day (although I am a teacher who walks around a lot). Doesn't deter me from wearing them though and I'm sure an insole would help. I recommend them!
My favourite sport socks. Good for your sneakers or your keds. Very sturdy. Fit like glove. Very comfortable
Very beautiful ring! Well worth the money. I am going to order other colors.
"I love these Acorn slippers and have been wearing them practically non stop since I received them!  I wear a size 7 shoe and these fit great with socks.  They are extremely well made and so comfortable....I want another pair! :)
Great price on amazon as well."
"I will wear this jacket hoodie every day. It is well made, comfortable, looks great, and has Attack on Titan wings of freedom on the front and the back of it! What more could I ask for?"
"Dress up a plain outfit~!  Have a little fun with your footwear, & a little bling for your feet... :O)"
Husband needed pants for the hospital.  Great fit and light weight
"Bought the hat for my mother to wear to church,  she loves it! Received it quite quickly as well! Well made!"
"The most comfortable bra I've had in a long time.  I love that Olga pads the area between you and the hooks.  Well made, smooth stitching and pretty.  Good if you carry weight in the tummy as it is cut higher in the front.  Straps stay up and the padding around the underwire is very good.  I ordered two more after the first.  The center of the cup is a silky material and will not hide a nipple line; there is no lining in the center of the cup.  I hope they never stop making this model.  Very good price as well."
"I coulndt find black sneakers that like, so after search for some time i found this ones. Ill say it worth the money totally, are soft for walk or run and also looks great."
Nice dress nice fit
Sexy with or with out a cover.  Loved the way it made me look and so did my guy.  Great look at a good price.
I purchased these because my 3 year old keeps losing earrings that are supposed to be for children and not easy to lose. She loves all the pretty colors. I only use the smallest size on her but she has managed to come home from school with both earrings for several weeks now. the fact that they are inexpensive makes me happy. They do not have screw backs. Just regular earrings.
"This product looks as is presented in the picture, it fits great and looks great, hopefully it will maintain its color"
"My husband really likes this scarf. It's not scratchy and the color goes well with his winter coat. He is very, very pleased!"
"it's ok, could be a little larger"
Love the color an fit
Only 4 stars because the picture is misleading. I thought it would be at the midleg when it is pulled up above the hips to tuck into it. Its fairly short when I do that. However the quality is great. Very flowy and the bow on the back isn't too big that you couldn't wear it untucked. overall I am satisfied with my purchase
Very lightweight shoe which is really nice for the warm weather. I wear an 8W and they fit perfectly. Very comfortable although I have not yet used them for any athletic activity. I walk a great deal but I don't use them for running. I have high arches so I needed to put in a different insole to provide the support I require.
"I got it on but couldn't close it. So, I took it off closed the hook and eye closures and then zipped it up. It was a bit of a struggle to get back on. Once on it looked great from the front but not from the back. I had rolls over the top of the back of it. I was very careful to order according to my measurements but it was still too small. I returned it. I don't have time to order another one before I need to wear it but if I did I'd order one size up from the size that my measurements indicated."
"This is my 2nd pair.  I wear a size 71/2 and first pair I bought  was a 6 1/2, they were slightly 2 small.  Went with a size 7 and they fit fine.  If I was to go with a 7 1/2 they would be to wide because they are made with a stretch material.  These shoes will wash up fine.  Just air dry them.  I wouldn't say you would want to walk around Disney for 6 hours.  Because the shoe is spongy, it takes more of an effort to walk.  A walking shoe is much stiffer and you get a better push off, these are to flexible."
"These have not given me any blisters and the sole breathes, and has grip.  Will hopefully buy more of these!"
Purchased these to wear in the pool for physical therapy.  They fit perfectly and look great!  I wear a size 2 and ordered the small.  Nice price.
I love the climbing man ear cuff!!! How unique and adorable!
Matches the purse perfectly.
"Bought as a gift for a nine year old girl who wears kids size 4 shoe, these fit her nicely and she loves them, wears a clean pair every day and gives her mom heck when she doesn't have a clean pair, thinking I may have to order another set."
Really nice and durable!
I love this sweater! It's very soft and has a nice drape. Fit is true to size.
I'm wearing this ring now.  I have this one and a 4mm one I purchased from Sabrina Silver and I trade off wearing them.  They are comfortable and one I can wear every day and not worry about what I'm doing.  A really nice ring for a great price.
"We returned the small size and ordered the medium.  My husband has small hands and we measured to be sure we ordered the correct size.  However the gloves run small, so had to send them back.  They appear to be well insulated.  We'll have to see if they are warm when we get some snow."
Size is accurate. Fit is comfortable. Good enough for work jeans. Not super thick which keeps me from feeling too hot but knees do get holes after not too long.
Incredible shoes and service .  I cod not be happier. I was looking for basic white heel for a long time. Thank you
Cute little slip!  We bought these for both of our girls and they are perfect under their Sunday or play dresses.  Very cute!
"Fits perfect for working, I'm 6'3 225 and it's good. I tried the longs, but I don't see no reason for them unless you are maybe 6'6"" or more."
Had to tear neck bigger
Adorable!  My grandson will be Super Mario for Halloween.
Love these be sure to order ONE SIZE BIGGER.  They do run small
Reviewed this type of shirt on Amazon and decided to try one. A lot of reviewers suggested getting a size smaller because they run a little large. I took that advice and the shirt fits nicely but if there is shrinkage after washing that could change. Some said the fabric was a little harsh but I find it to be to my liking. Shirt has a nice fell and looks good. I can't say as to the comfort level when it gets in the 85-90 degree temps. All in all I like the shirt and I am going to order a couple more in the next larger size because I prefer a looser fit.
these fit my 5month old baby like her 6month clothing to say its 6-9months but i love it.
"I really like these pants, got a jean like vibe and comfort but you can get away with them for business casual. Slim fit, so a but of a skinny pant vibe but comfy and casual style."
"I got this Senpaic messenger bag in the coffee color and it looks pretty much as the picture looks in the listing.  The leather looking accents are a little bit lighter though.  I say leather looking because I don't think it is real, but it has a very similar look and feel.  The canvas is fairly thick and feels durable. The front of the bag has a couple of straps that have to be unbuckled to open the bag.  The buckles are attached to the pockets that are on the front. When you open up the front flap, you will see the 2 snap closure front pockets.  The top of the bag can be zippered, although it doesn't have to be.  Inside there is one zippered pouch and on the other side is a 2 pocket holder, which looks like they are meant to be the size for cell phones.  This 2 pocket holder does not seem like it is the sturdiest, unlike the rest of the features.  There is also is also a pocket on each side of the bag, so there are plenty of places to stick smaller items.  The shoulder strap is adjustable so you can wear this over the shoulder or across the body. The description says vintage style and that describes it well - I love it.

I received this item fee in exchange for my honest, unbiased feedback.  The price I paid had no bearing on my review, as I have no relationship with the seller and I never guarantee a good review."
My favorite shoes. I order a new pair every 6-9 months
"This is my fourth pair of Bearpaw boots but first of the newer style. So far I love these boots. They are comfortable, fit as I expected, but actually seem a little more firmly built than the previous ones. Overall, awesome boots. I usually wear a size 6 1/2 and have purchased both a 6 and 7 before; the 6 definitely fits a bit better as these will stretch a bit."
"A bit small than other shoes, maybe I should buy one more size with this shoes...h h h h h..."
I love this lightweight coat or fashion piece. I am size 18 get the 3x it worked it says size 16 on it.
"Cute and very comfortable.  I wear it as a beach cover-up, but it can transition to a casual dress easily."
Such a cute cap - bought the toddler size for my 2yr old grandson - he loves the cap and is wearing it - it is too big which I expected but he will grow into it. The cap quality is excellent - better than what I thought it would be!
Great Heels for a great price! My Wife loves these heels!
"So glad we spent the extra money to get quality boots. The edge of our property is a marsh and these get SERIOUS use. Stay dry, are comfortable and warm in freezing Wisconsin weather. Will never buy cheap boots for my kids again."
I absolutely love these boots. Comfortable enough for all day wear. True to size.
"This is a beautiful romper, unfortunately it does not suit pear-shaped bodies. I purchased the BLACK (that crosses over in the front) in LARGE and it fit my lower half well, but I could have gone 2 sizes down in the top part. I truly wished I could have kept it."
"This skirt was exactly as described and it fit as expected.  I am 5'4""/140 lbs/40"" hips and it reaches two inches below my knees. I wanted a plain pencil skirt and it comfortable.  The material for this black skirt is lightweight but thick enough to be opaque.  Can be worn in the office or casually when paired with complementary clothing.  I cannot speak to what it would look like after a wash but I can certainly say that the material is a magnet for dust particles.  It was a good purchase given the sale price.

Update:
I recently ordered the Olive Ladies Cotton Stretch Fold-over Waist skirt.  This order was cancelled by the seller."
"I can't say how much I love these. Perfectly comfortable, cute, not too baggy, just right."
"Loose fit, good soft quality material. Very cute! Will wear it for Halloween !"
Great quality.  Was larger than I expected.  Haven't washed it yet so don't know if it might shrink.
These are cute and very well priced. My only compliant is that they run a little big and long for a 2T. Better too big than too small!
"Great for my veterinary technician practice. I am 5'4"" and 140lbs and I got a small it fits great."
Took a little break in time but fits like a glove.
"i normally wear size 8, I ordered a size 9.  they fit like an 8 .  just order up one size"
Very cute and hasn't tarnished!
"Really nice. Comfortable. Well made. However, leather shows scuffs very easily. Constantly buffing out the scuff marks."
"love these! Did not disappont. Lightweight, stylish and comfortable."
"Love these shoes, very comfortable, worth the money."
"Bought these for my Mom. She liked the color,easy on /off. After the first wear she had blisters on some of her toes on one side. I was really disappointed about this. She has worn them since without a problem."
Perfect! Tons of compliments every time I wear this. I'll be ordering more from this seller
"The hat is just what I needed to protect my head from the sun.  I had a cancer spot on my head, and since I am not a hat person, I needed a light weight, brimmed hat.  Just what I needed is what I got,"
"As others have noted, these are ""warm"" inside, but great outside. I have not problem wearing them all day in an office environment."
"Does the job, held up well when we sent it though the airport. Would recomend."
"I bought this backpack for two reasons: nice design and the size (reviews said that it is good for a folder size). Well, it looks really nice, my son likes it, but I'm disappointed because it's not enough high for a folder inside, unless you force and squeeze the folder (with the document) .. my son needs a folder size backpack."
"If you don't care too much about the appearance of a wide shoe this one feels like you're walking on clouds.
It is super comfy and I have been using it to travel when I'm not travelling too light.  It's great if you have feet that swell up easily and feet that don't sweat too much. Comfiest shoes ever!"
"Absolutely perfect! they match the corset I bought and they're pretty comfortable. The Velcro cover piece with the gear wheels is a little cheesy, but overall doesn't detract from the beauty of these boots."
"This is a jog bra, not a sports bra. I am a 36 B and the medium/large fits perfectly. The girls don't move, so for jogging, it's great. I really like this bra it's pretty comfortable. I only took off a star because the fitting is small, but otherwise, it's pretty good. I would recommend it and would buy another."
They fit perfect and were beautiful. I agree with many other reviewers that using white elastic on black gloves seems a little strange.
"beautiful flowy chiffon fabric. the skirt is well made, full and looks just like the picture.  I  really liked it. the dangling belt has 2 peacock feathers at the end, which are easily removable, I did not think they added anything to the overall floral effect."
My son LOVES the Fruit of the Loom.  Fit as expected and wash well too.
"This jacket is great quality as expected from London Fog.  It is flattering, cute and functional.  The hood is big and removable which I love."
"As usual, Sperry provides an awesome shoe.  This is my 4th pair of Sperrys and these are just as comfortable as the others.  Love the fact they are a more casual boat shoe with a little bit of a twist from the standard boat."
"This is a comfortable shoe but the fit was too flat for me, I need a little more under the heel."
"It's form fitting, but overall a good skirt for any nightly shenanigans after work."
"Love it. Medium fit perfectly, somewhat form fitting but i like that. Fits true to size and length is perfect. Im a bit long waisted so its tough to find sweaters that hit at the hips properly. Im 5'8 and wear a size 8 normally. Washed it already a few times on cold. Hung to dry."
This is so beautiful in person! Great buy! And great quality!
230lbs and fits really good....gildan is known for a tighter fit around the neck which is a must for me
It's so soft and comfortable!  Not a skirt/dress person on a normal basis & got it for weddings and special events.  Lots of compliments!
the quality is great and the price is low.
"This dress is incredibly flattering and so comfortable! I typically have a hard time finding full length skirts and dresses the fit me correctly and aren't so long I'm tripping over them, but this one was the perfect length for me. I'm 5'4"" without shoes on and the hem grazes the tops of my feet. I can wear this dress with the thinnest of sandals or the lowest flats and still not be dragging it on the ground. The material is nice and light so as not to be hot in the warm weather, but thick enough to hide undergarments. I was impressed with the quality of the dress for the price I paid!

After my last child, I'm left a bit lacking in the chest area, and a bit ""over endowed"" in the belly. This dress drapes nicely, enhances my bust without the need for an uncomfortable push-up bra, and the shaping around the waist hits in just the right spots to hide ""mommy tummy"" and make me feel comfortable and pretty. My husband smiled big and gave me tons of compliments the first time I wore it out to dinner and my sister asked where I bought it and has ordered one in a different color for herself already. HIGHLY recommend this dress."
Okay this is the perfect light weight jacket I needed. I love that the length is pretty decent and the pockets keep your hands warm.
They are bigger than I thought and I can't wear them all day because of it but night on the town is good enough for me !!! Oh yes they do shine !!
Very nice. They were a gift for my daughter. She likes them a lot
I luv this bag!  It's the perfect size.  I carry a laptop back and forth to work every day and this bag is big enough to carry what I need personally without adding to my load.  I wish the black was still available though because one of friend's wants mine!  No way am I giving this one up!  lol
Great color and product. Essie is a great nail polish! This color was difficult to find at my local stores. So glad I found it on Amazon.
"Great duffel for the price.  It's also a really good size for me... fits a ton of stuff.  Seems durable, too, and the zippers are great.  I've used it on airlines, on ski trips, and on 2 week vacations.  A lot of people seem to look for one that stands on it's own, and as others have said it's all about how you pack it.  If there's not much in there it won't stand, but then you just lay it on the floor... if you can't bend down to pick it up then maybe you shouldn't be toting a big duffel...?  Fully packed it sottd up just fine.

I really can't think of any negatives.  It might be a little better if it had an internal compartment or two, but I don't mind the one big compartment."
"I bought these about a year ago and was so satisfied with the product that I had to order another pack. Finally, some socks which are confortable and not tight at the top. They are very soft and good quality!"
The earrings were just as advertised. This is the first earring that my daughter has been able to put on and leave in for more than a minute.  Because of her sensitive ears it's been very difficult to keep earrings on them.  I am so happy that I found something that workes with her body chemistry. '
i like do not it
Great shoes. I now have black and brown. No problems.
Very nice piece. Versatile piece that is a great size.
Sized very small.
"Gift for my mom, but she said they feel great on her feet."
"These are not capris!  They are full length!  Aside from that, they are soft and will be nice once summer is over."
"THESE ARE GREAT, ALTHOUGH THE COLOR AS SHOWN IS WAY OFF!! THESE ARE NOT TEAL/TURQUOISE BLUE, THEY ARE A ROYAL BLUE, I AM WOMANS SIZE 9 & ORDERED AN 8 SO THEY FIT PERFECT"
I loved these so much I ordered a second pair!
Good value. Fits great.
My son loved it!  Good quality and warm!
"good looking shoes, comfortable, good price point.

run a bit large, buy a half size down."
These shoes are decent for the price but not very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and not the best quality overall. You get what you pay for in this case.
"product as described, received when expected, packed well... happy customer!

I do like the shoes; just a person preference - I would rather have shoes I can tie.  This is not a reflection on the product's quality.  Very happy with the quality."
they seem a bit small for a size 11.5 feet.
"At 69 years of age, my feet and legs were beginning to protest at my walking around the house in just my sock feet - they were screaming for support.  I ordered the New Balance WX608V3 Cross-Training shoes to wear as my 'inside shoes' which means since I don't wear my 'outside shoes' inside, I wear these shoes all day inside the house.  They have provided the much needed support for my feet and legs."
Very cute and nice and lightweight! I will definitely be getting these again.
"4 stars because my son loves these underwear. However, they fade and shrink pretty quickly. I would advise to get the next size up when ordering these."
Excellent shoe. Good for individual's with wide feet
Replaced my old suunto strap with this one. Looks great and feels like it should. It was a bit pricey but i would rather pay a little extra and get good quality. Ive had it for almost a year now and aslong as you wash it every couple of days itll last a long time. I go out fishing and boating in salt water and it holds up.
Great fit . Well made
Excellent. Quality is top notch. Colors every man should have in their personal collection.
JUST WHAT SHE WANTED
"I lost my expensive gold claddagh ring at the shore and was so upset. Because I've worn a claddagh every day for almost 15 years, I NEEDED a quick and cheap replacement until I could buy a new gold one. This really is a beautiful ring and the best part is.. it hasn't turned my finger green! (hope I didn't just jinx myself!). I have put my gold claddagh hunt on hold as this is doing the job perfectly!"
Love the color. But shorter than I expected.
"Fits great and it looks great. Because of the adjustable chain, you can make it tight or drape it a little longer."
"Once again after scouring the local stores, I find what I want in minutes at Amazon...at a great price.  Daughter loves them and they fit perfectly...course I had her old ones to go by.  At least Ugg is consistent."
"I love that the pants are so comfortable for my son but I ordered a size 6 and the pants are slightly shorter or about the same as a size 5 dress pant and the shirt is also about a size 5. Definitely smaller than a size 6. I compared the shirt to a Carter's size 5 dress/collared shirt and the body is the same, and it's made of 55% cotton so it could shrink a little. I'd order up a size."
Very cute and fits well. Nice light weight for summer.
"Nice, basic hoops.  Closure is secure."
Its very tight and runs small so I ordered a large and I love it.  I usually wear a small/medium in other dresses.  I love the color.
So cute.  Second year we've gotten these cute water shoes for my grandson
very comfortable; very light-weight which I like but wonder how long they will hold up.
"Really enjoyed these the past winter. Being tall and curvy, good fitting tights are not easy to find. These were perfectly warm and comfy with my skirts. I have both black and navy, and the colors are good and wash well."
"These are just what I wanted, real soft leather and a beautiful cognac brown color! They look super cute on and fit true to size."
"I needed navy flats to wear with a casual dress.  I ordered these, and I am so glad that I did.  They fit very well and look great.  I can wear them with something more dressy, or with jeans.  A great shoe for the price."
Super comfy and the perfect weight of fabric.
My granddaughter loved this backpack.  It is well made and durable.  I love that the lunch kit was included.
The perfect shirt!  I was so happy I ordered this for my friend's birthday because she was able to use it for the Women's March!!  She received so many compliments and wears it all the time!!
Top was to large and not the color shown.
"These I was on the fence about and ultimately returned but I still think they merit a 4 star. The reason for the deduction and me returning was b/c my heel was slipping out of them, too much to warrant keeping. They were comfortable, insole-wise and cushiony and well made. However I have an avg. to narrower heel and slippage was too much(usually take 8M but ordered 7.5M and the length was perfect to go down half size).  Also, even though they are cute in a hipster/nerd type of way, I think to pull off this trend, for me personally, I need to either be 20 years younger or 10 years older! (I am about 40yr old)  :-) Maybe I'll come back in 10 and give it a try again..."
just alittle small after wash but nice weight and warm
My 9 year old loves this shoe. He has several pair of skechers and loves that they are so light and flexible. I love that they are made well and last fairly long for a kids shoe. The fun neon colors are his favorite. They are great for school and the price is right.
This was a  good value for an excellent sandal. The arch support takes pressure off of my knees and back.
Best mans bar soap
"great organizer for all my rings/necklaces/watches... holds a lot and i love the purple color. the height is perfect for drawers, with room on top of it to spare. highly recommend."
"Pretty good fit. Just a little large, but not enough to return."
Love love these sandals.
"Awesome! Great quality. I was hesitating on the color, but it's beautiful. The color on the picture is pretty accurate."
Love life is good shirts!!
"The color isn't the cream color that the picture shows it's more of a tan. I do like this the material feels nice. We use this for a comfortable outfit to send our son to daycare in. With every ""Asian outfit"" we have ordered they have came with hats. My son is 18 months old and does have a larger head the hats never fit him."
Gorgeous dress. Very long but so beautiful and well made.
"I needed the shirt pictured to wear under a uniform shirt.  The one I received had a Tesla logo on the neck.  It's a fine shirt for the price, just didn't want a logo on the collar."
"Great comfort, great looks, easy on the feet. Like it so much I got the denim color blue and I purchased the mid high style in grey too."
"I love these bags. They feel good, they look good and they are very useful - TSA accepts them so i don't have to pull out the laptop. The only thing (and its a big one) is that they don't have any padding to help protect the laptop from impact. You really have to be gentle when putting the back down on hard surfaces as the laptop only has a thing canvas between it and the hard floor."
It is made if real leather. My husband really likes it.
Slippers are well-made and look great.  Work perfectly for moving around the gym locker room and showers.  Very pleased.  Highly recommended
I love these type of t-shirts with bible verses on it. This is one of my favorite verses. The color of the letters really pop with the smokey gray background.
Sister LOVED it!!!
Better than what I was expecting. Great purchase. It's now my husbands favorite two pieces of jewelry.
"I have short arms, so the sleeves are a bit long. Otherwise they fit fine."
These are so comfortable! I would buy them again.
Good quality boot second pair of this brand I have owned.
I bought two of these dresses. Very glad I did. They will be my go to dresses this summer. The material and construction are good.
"Dress Fits well and looks great!  However, I am 5'4 and it hits me at the ankle with no shoes. Ordered a Medium, usually wear a size 10.
 Also, not a huge fan of the stretchy material. Received mine damaged but returning and ordered another one for the same price."
Best most amazing shoes I have put on my feet .... Mic drop.....
Only 4 stars because the top is way too tiny but I am in love with the bottoms! Ive searched far and wide for super cheeky bottoms that weren't tiny in the front and these are perfect. So comfy and flattering and the material is great!!
"Fantastic costume! Great quality for a costume. Better than I expected, very comfortable  and good size too! Love it wore it for Disneyland's struck or Treat event."
Just as hoped for and expected
"This coat is very well constructed with details that really make it look classy. One drawback is that it doesn't fit perfect because the instructions for measurements and sizing do NOT match the way we do in the US, and the manufacturer did not give instruction as to HOW to take the measurements to assure correct fit for their foreign manufacturing. Also, it is rather thin, so not very warm, but it does look very classy for more formal occasions."
"These will hopefully last as long as my last pair did.  If the product is still made as well, I should get 20 years out of them.  Doing great so far."
"I did receive a discount to review this item.
This watch isn't that bad. I haven't worn it to much but it does look pretty nice. The metal seems a bit cheap but the style is unique to say the least. I did not like the cheap leather watch band it came with. I switched it out for a nicer, thicker band and it really looks nice."
Works just fine and accurately.  I have used it for many years to keep my suitcases under the airline weight limits to avoid the embarrassing re-pack in front of the check in desk at the airport.
"Love it, looks so cute on my daughter. She thinks it's a princess dress because the back is longer than the front. Too adorable."
"Fits beautifully and I love them! After having twins I'm very self conscious about my tummy, these really help create a slimmer tummy, and I am glad that every time I sit down and stand up I do not have to keep readjusting them like most jeans. The practically come up to my waist, instead of the normal hip huggers that are now the fashion norm. It's so hard to find a pair of fashionable jeans that come up to the waist these days, so now that I found these and I know I like them, I'm going to be getting some more!"
"I am a severe overpronater- ""weak ankles"" and flat feet- which have wreaked havoc over the years by messing up my big toe MTP joints and affecting my hips.  My husband calls these my clown shoes because they do look a little different (not very sleek) but I love them. I could feel the difference immediately. The soles are designed to compensate for my inward-leaning feet, taking the pressure of my great toes.  There is plenty of cushioning, too.  I took these on a 15 day trip to Israel and Jordan (miles and miles of walking) and ended up wearing them every single day. I cannot comment on using them as running shoes. I ordered size 9, which is what I usually wear in other Asics models and the fit was as expected.  Just wish they came in more than two colors."
"So far, I really like these boots. They are VERY warm. However, they do run small...I ordered my regular size and exchanged for a half size up and I'm still deciding. The best way I can describe it is that the front of the boot is narrow top to bottom. I think this would be good for keeping your foot in place for walking/hiking but it takes a bit to get used to. Holding they will get more comfortable and hold up over time."
These things are great a little tight on my wrists but then again I'm 6'4 230 pounds lol so hey for most normal size people probably great other then that I've been rocking these for ah Month now and their great and stylish one broke because I snagged it
"Love this coat!  Runs a bit small/snug. It is form fitting. The zipper is a little tricky so don't be in a hurry...
Very long. I'm 5'9 , and the Large covers most of my body!
Fur collar is way cute. Love it."
"Adorable! Material not way to thin... love the colors! It's great! I'm 100lbs with moderate size ""C"" cup. S fit great! The tie in back really helps!"
"I used this for my Katniss Everdeen costume and won a costume contest so I was very excited about that. Good for show and for the entertainment value. I shoot arrows across my room all the time, I only wish they give you more arrows so I don't have to get up and retrieve them as often. The arrows though are pretty cheap and lightweight, but if this isfor a kid, that's a good thing. You might be able to knock down a plastic cup but not like a mug or anything with a good weight to it."
"My grandson loves this coat!!! For one, he is 12 years old and he is one who hates being all bundled up. If the coat is thick or similar to a down coat ... forget it he will not wear it. So it is hard to find a coat that it light enough, but still keeps him warm when he is walking to school. This coat fits the bill, I would say this is a medium weight coat and the quality is top notch! The fabric is in my opinion nice and the stitching are all done tight and even, I even had a hard time finding any loose threads. The sleeve length is perfect goes right to the wrist and the velcro straps seal the sleeves up nice and tight and stay put! I have seen other reviews concerning the authenticity of this jacket....while I can not comment on that for sure. I do know that the jacket I received was made very well and I am really happy that he likes it and will wear it.

I purchased a size 14/16 for him and it leaves enough room while wearing it to have a hoodie or sweater fit comfortably underneath. Pleased with the jacket. But again I can not confirm or deny it this is indeed a London Fog Jacket."
These fit perfectly. The sole is hard which makes it convenient for going out and getting the morning paper and also for getting the mail. The stripes are unusual but look good.
slightly pricey but good quality
love these jeans they are a great fit. I am 5'1 125 and the 27 fit perfectly so happy i ordered these.
This is a very soft nightgown that I purchased for my mom who is in a nursing home.  It arrived promptly and has been washed.  I gave it four stars because I do not know the durability.  So far...so good.
"comfortable, nice looking ,good price"
Wonderful fit.so nice. love. them.
"Finally, a backpack has been developed to suit the weariest traveler as well as the coolest coffee shop lounger.

If you're looking for bells and whistles in a sleek package, this is the knapsack to buy. That is, once you figured it out. After you've gotten the hang of it, though, you will enjoy all the various compartments, light weight, and options, like the removable aluminum support, or the nifty feature that allows you to conceal the straps.
(Wenzel even went to the trouble of including a bag for your beagle, though oddly they refer to it as a detachable day bag rather than as a knapsack suitable for a small pup.)"
"Beautiful tutu, very full!  Was a bit tight in my 2 year old daughter even though I ordered the larger size.  Looks adorable on my daughter!"
"Perfect, I wear 517's to work and they are very difficult to find in Southern California. But I just ordered here on Amazon and two days latter they are exactly what I need. I'm a Levi guy all the way!!"
"Previous reviewers are correct, this sleeper does run small. The description said that it should fit snug, but I think the arm and leg bands of the 3T may have been too small after a few washes for my 2.5 yo at 30 lbs. I'm glad I listened to the other reviewers and went with the 4T instead. It is a little long in the torso but it won't be tight in the arms and legs for a while.
As for the reason I purchased this in the first place, it does not prevent my LO from removing his sleeper and diaper at night. He was able to get out of it within the first 30 minutes. But he really likes it and stopped removing it after a week. Maybe the smaller size would have been harder for him to remove.
One more thing, the fabric is thin."
My 8 year old daughter loved them.
"My husband was very excited to find these at Amazon.  He's looked high and low and couldn't find the Gold Toe brand he wanted that didn't have cotton in the fabric blend.  He said they are comfortable and keep is feet cool.  As an engineering tech in a large, busy hospital, he's on his feet all day.  He said he likes the way they stay up and don't bunch as he walks around.  I immediately ordered more!"
"This is a really handsome watch for casual wear that certainly looks a lot more expensive than it actually is. It's larger than I expected it to be which makes it really stand out. It's an impressive piece. It takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, especially the clasp, as the manual leaves a lot to be desired, but it's just a watch. You'll figure it out. It's perfect for everyday wear - work or play!"
They are a bit hard to get in but I like them.  Very nice and different.  People comment on them because they are different.
These are good for my sore knees.
"I love it! I'm 5'6. 155lb, so I ordered small. It's just a bit small, but I don't usually wear it all bottomed up, so it's not a big deal. If you are like my size, and want to wear it loose,  try getting the medium instead."
My vest arrived early and fit like a dream. It completed my outfit and kept me warm.
Love the fabric and the way it hangs when worn.
"Sooo comfy and I got a lot of compliments on the style.  Also, I've had 3 kids so my tummy isn't what it used to be - this shirt covered up the belly without looking like I was wearing a tent.  The only ""issue"" is that it's a bit see through so I wore a camisole.  Normally that'd be no biggie but I live in Florida so too many layers are a bummer when it's warm but right now the weather is great so I guess it's not really an issue.  Overall very happy with my purchase."
"This winter has been so cold I decided it was finally time to buy long underwear. My waist is around 35-36 (most of the time) so I was a bit concerned about other underwear I saw which had medium as 32-34 (large at 36-38 sounded too big). Thankfully this medium pair fits perfectly - it's a comfortable fit without being too loose or too tight. I wear boxers underneath too for extra warmth and they still fit fine. They definitely add some warmth, though don't expect to feel toasty while the temperature is around zero. The nice thing is they aren't so warm as to cause sweating indoors. My only concern with them is ripping a hole in them with my toenails, but that can be prevented by putting on socks first."
"Best capri legging ever. Love the wide waistband, comfy fit...I have several pairs!"
Very nice quality and they are long enough to stay tucked in at work. I use them under my chef coat and they provide the cooling I need around the cooking area.
Got this for my BIG man and he loves it!
Wear these riding a horse.  Not bad.
I love how this dress feels and fits my body great.
Love these shoes. Look great and very comfortable. Danced all night in them.
"These are beautiful.  Very simple, but yet elegant.  And at a very good price.  Have a good feel to them.  I bought them as a gift, but did try them on and they are comfortable."
very comfortable!!!!
Love these - wore them last summer and will wear them again this summer.
"Love the color. I ordered an xl and I usually L. Because of the material,  I did not want it to cling to tightly.  Fits great. I am 5'9 and it hits me about lower hip. Which is a good length."
"My husband loves these shoes for work, he is on his feet for ten hours a day and they offer good support."
Very versatile shoe
Beautiful tan leather- they are so comfortable right out of the box.
I love wearing these with blue jeans.
"my grandson loves it, still looks brand new and easy for him to carry."
This is a very comfortable dress
The Shirt looks nice but very thin material!
My husband really likes the sleeves
This item works. It does the trick. The cost was fair. I suggested this item to serveral of my friends. I just wish the legs were straighter.
Super cute and comfort :)
"it wasn't quite the color I expected, it is more purple stripes than blue. Seems comfortable"
"Very pretty for so low costs. I'm satisfied. As a gift it is always a welcome having such little accessories. Thank you, will or would buy again"
"Nice-looking, comfortable shoe."
"Nice, comfortable, casual Friday jean for the office.
runs a tad large."
"I'm always hesitant buying socks online because I get worried about the texture. But, these are perfect! They have just the right amount of acrylic/nylon/spandex mix and fit comfortably on my feet. I wear a 7.5 how and these fit just right for me. They certainly could stretch more for someone with bigger feet.

The socks are thin but definitely not cheap. I don't like when my feet get hot so I think these will be great in the 90 degree weather we get in the summer. I LOVE that the bottom of the socks have a little extra fabric and texture. It makes them feel really great on the soles of my feet.

I love that they are all different colors, because it helps me match them when I'm sorting laundry, but when I'm wearing them with tennis shoes, they just look like white socks. I would certainly order these socks again! Hopefully I won't have to for awhile.

*Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount."
"I wear this necklace 24/7 (shower, sleep, pool, everywhere).  It has held up much better than expected.  The last (different) one that I purchased broke in less than a month, but I couldn't get myself to buy an expensive one.  So I gave this necklace a try.  It is sturdy, petite, and perfect.  It continues to look like new and I have had no issues with durability.  Would definitely make this purchase again."
I wore these boots yesterday and they felt comfortable all day
The only problem I have is that they did not last as long as I had hoped.  I have bought them again though.
Lovely Alex and Ani bracelet.
This belt can fit me as well as my Hunny and he likes it. We will see how long it lasts. If it does we will order another pair.
"I purchased this for my daughter 3 days ago and it arrived yesterday morning in time for her 16th Birthday gathering that evening. It is the first ""special jewelry"" that I have ever purchased for her. Not only did she absolutely LOVE it, but my mother loved it as well!  I gave my mom and Dad the information about NOVICA and they will be shopping this store as well.  It is even more beautiful than in the pictures and gorgeous on.  Simple, elegant, stunning, wonderful craftsmanship. We also loved the thoughtful card with the artists name and description and meaning behind the pearls and jade.  The jade is beautifully polished and the most gorgeous soft green color.  Looks stunning on my daughter.  It also means a lot to us to contribute to NOVICA and the artists.  Thank you so much for a wonderful buying experience.  For me this has been the best purchase experience through Amazon so far!  I will share a picture shortly."
So many compliments on this dress it is beautiful.
Its really cute! My daughter has two years old and I ordered the size 3.
"Great little pair of pool-shower slippers.
Plus the red makes them easy to spot."
"I've never had much success ordering clothing online, so I had low expectations when ordering this top. But to my surprise, when this came, I liked it! It is comfortable. I ordered my normal size and it is fitted (but not clingy). The material is medium-weight cotton. It feels very similar to T-shirt material. The length is perfect. I'm 5'3"" and it comes down just below my rear.

Wore it with boots and leggings today and got a lot of compliments."
"12 very, very attractive brooches plus a special treat of 1 extra free brooch as a thank you.  very nice."
"Awesome looking watch.  If you're looking for a cheap, water proof watch for jugging or performing your favorite outdoors activities this is it!"
Quite beautiful in person
Gorgeous & comfy
too good..comfortable and fit as expected
"Very cute, good quality, but run a little small."
Very cute summer outfit. Lace is cute and holding through numerous washes.
"Perfect fit, love the company"
"This watch has gotten me many compliments, and it looks good and is practical.  We live in the middle of the country and our children live on both coasts, so the three dials keep track for all three.  The watch looks sharp with the copper-colored faces, and the white hands make it easy to read.  The watch band is far superior to anything in or even more than it's price range suggests.  I highly recommend this watch."
"I love these shoes!  They are comfortable and give great support.  I wear them all year as my house shoes and for summer outings as well.  I will never own another brand of ""flip flop."""
Great belt. Nice quality and looks like it will be with me for years and years
"For me, this pair of 505 pants is a bit longer than the usual 505 jeans and the color of the pants is a bit darker than the pics shown on the web."
This is my second order so needless to say I am extremely happy with my purchase. These undies just holds n hugs all my curves giving a smooth outline. Works just as well as those expensive shape wear things...without killing your pockets
"So cute. My daughter gets compliments every-time she wears them. The material has the slightest opalescent quality, which makes them even prettier than I expected. Also, my daughter can wear them all day without getting sore feet."
Looks great & keeps me warm!
Snaggy threads around button holes.
"I ordered this costume for my daughter for a high school history project.  It fit perfectly...except the bust, which was too large...exactly what others had written in their reviews.  Other than that it was an affordable costume that was exactly what we were looking for."
Kickass !!
"My grandson is very particular about his shoes.  They have to fit perfectly and be comfortable or they will be hidden in the back of the closet!  He put these on as soon as they arrived, and he has worn them daily ever since! He has narrow feet, and most shoes are just too wide."
Girl friend loved it and gets tons of compliments
"T shirt is excellent, holds op under many washing's with no color loss or shrinking. Great fit. mine is Xxl and perfect."
"Love this one. The color goes well with many of my dresses: red, green, purple, blue, gray, white, black..."
Love it! Bought 2 for my daughters. Would recommend this product...
"my son wears this by the pool and wore it on our beach vaca.great sizing , good quality serves its purpose well"
"These pants are what I expected, good for work and lots of cargo space."
"I received these bags recently and was impressed with the options provided. However, the one I choose seemed like it was a nice navy blue in
the pic--when I got them, they were actually gray--now, the small icon over each pic does say the color and it does say gray, confusing!--however, the pic was definitely blue! Exchanging them for the brown set, I will see how they stand up in time. I am impressed, however, with the speed of shipping and free no hassle returns. I also think that even if they last 6 months, I will have received value as I wanted all of the matching smaller bags (to help me organize my handbag) and wallet."
These shoes are great for traveling and walking around.  They look nice with jeans and shorts and are very comfortable.  I recommend them.
"I've been wearing these shoes for years.  I just realized Amazon sells them and will be buying from Amazon from now on.  The soles do wear out really quickly and I guess thats a way to keep you buying more, but other than that, they are comfortable,  They don't breathe very well. If they had a Vibram sole they would be better,  For the price they are good.  I have thought about trying to get some resoled since the leather outlasts the sole."
"At the outset, I must confess to being something of a Yuppie.  I have shoes for every occasion.  That said, my trail running shoes were not doing a great job of protecting my feet from a rocky trail where I walk the dog daily, so I ordered these.  They are a bit large, as others have noted, but that's likely because they're meant to be worn with hiking socks.  With heavy socks, they're wonderful.  The outsole is firm, but not hard, and glides over rocks without a sense of sharpness.  Adding to that, the inner sole is a rubbery materials which softens the trail as well.  The upper is light and has the feel of a running shoe more than a boot.  They are a great trail shoe and I'm glad I ordered them."
Very pretty. Very dainty. Will be careful washing it.
It's absolutely beautiful! It comes with hidden handles on the inside which are optional to use and carry it like a briefcase. It's very soft and light weight. If you're a butterfly lover then this case is for you! :)
Nice and big. Arrived fast. Sofened up nicely after the first wash
"I love this skirt.  I'm 5'1"" and it's the perfect length, very soft and so far hasn't pilled."
thanks so much i love them...
"I only wear them when I run, and I can wear them very comfortably!!!!  Great looking shoe."
"Very good, 100% cotton. Just what we wanted"
"AS ADVERTISED.  DO NOT WICK THAT WELL, SLIGHT EARITATION."
I've been searching for something like this for a long time.  Super cute!
Nicer than described.
MY GRANDSON LOVES THIS OUTFIT.
Fit well and not a heavy short. Nice to wear
Bought this for my husband's new Martian watch. He loves the way it looks and had no problem putting it on the watch or sizing it to his wrist. He's been using it for several weeks and it's holding up well so far.
Very very cute
This dress is soooooo gorgeous on my baby!!!! It fits perfect.... I absolutely love it!!! She was very excited when she tried it on....
"Bought these as my Halfingers are getting old, and worn. I decided to try mens slippers as they are wider than womens. Not the case for these, they are narrow, but still keeping them in hope they will stretch a little, they also are a little tight in length."
I like the moisture wicking feature. No more sweating getting to the blind and then freezing once you get there.
I suggest get one cup size up to have full coverage. I'm a B and just for kicks got a c. Best decision ever! It covered almost everything. I used it for a backless gown and it look awesome. I'm happy with my purchase.
"Taking a bit to get used to the release, but seems a great value and works well. Don't know how I could rate any belt as 5 star but this is a solid 4! Would recommend to everyone."
"These are the most comfortable shoes I've had in years! I wore them every day on vacation, with no break-in time whatsoever. They are sturdy, but not hiking boots - wish there were more colors..."
love these.  Lightweight.  Comfy.  Easy on and off.
Awesome  official  Harry  potter HP socks!
perfect. Thnks
"This is a really cute shawl, and I look forward to adding it to the costume that I am currently putting together."
"great pant, very comfortable and warm. you can wear this anytime in the winter even in spring and fall."
"Same bracelet and same price as you can buy in a store. However, instead of the pretty box,  it comes in a little cheap plastic bag. Gave it a 4 because I expected nicer packaging to give as a gift."
very useful for boys slepping
I absolutely love love love it! It is gorgeous fun and so cool!! :)
These are the best shoes I have purchased on line period.  They may run a little small but I had assumed this so I ordered a half size up as every shoe seems to be running small that I purchase online.  This shoe fits well and is very comfortable I would recommend to anyone.
Very comfy and the fit is great. My only con is I wish they were about 2 inches longer.
GREAT PRODUCT..LIFTS AND GIVES ME MY 25 YEAR OLD WELL ROUNDED BOTTOM..SHIPPED ON TIME..I WILL BE ORDERING ANOTHER AND NOW BOTH OF MY SISTERS WANTS ONE AND MY OLDEST DAUGHTER...
Good shorts overall. They will shrink a bit in the dryer.
"""Kids Headquarters"" is a great quality product and adorable! Alot nicer than I expected for the price - very well made clothing."
"I wore this dress yesterday to a wedding. I ordered the blue (I've noticed in some items the color matters). I am 5'7, 200lbs and 40DD. From reading the reviews, I ordered a 2X...MISTAKE! The dress has a bit of stretch to it. I spent $50 on alterations (I did get it shortened to right above my knees). I should have ordered the L. My friend ordered the black and her length was perfect."
fits well and works as designed
"Clark's is the go-to shoe for me, and this one does not disappoint! I put them on with bare feet soon after receiving them and have not though twice about my feet since! Great quality for the price and cute styles~~!"
For a standard fit this shirt it goes well on v-shape body types & the color looks great when worn with a lighter pre washed or darker color jean.
"I have high arched wide feet, and these shoes fit really comfortably! Love them, unique, super cute!"
Good quality. But sizing is off. I'm 5'9 205 pounds. Xl was too big.. Have to exchange. Other wise it's made well. And a size down should do the trick!
"I received the Bat Costume! My son will be 3 years old a few weeks before Halloween, and wears 2T or 3T in clothes. I got this in 24 months, as it was the largest size they had. The long sleeved shirt is long (sleeves and shirt length) which is great! The pants fit him perfectly, which is fine, and if he happens to grow in height, I'll just put some black socks on him to cover his ankles. The bubble bat part of the costume fits him a little long, which is also good, but the one negative was that he couldn't get it on by himself (it isn't very wide for him to put it on himself like a jacket). The hood was a perfect fit!"
"Great product, great price! Fits great!"
"These boots look really cute with a pair of blue jeans or some daisy dukes BUT the color scuffs off very easily. I wore them to school one day and noticed that there was a little white streak on the tip of the toe from where the color has chipped. I'm still not even sure how they scuffed because I was sitting at a desk most of the day.

Anyways, I still like them and wear them all the time. I have these boots in Tan."
"These are great boots for the price.  The leather came up a little high for my height, and I will get them altered to be a little lower.  It's a shame that the same leather was not used on the top of the boot on the inside so you can fold them over.  As it stands, the shiny part on the inside looks a little cheap when you fold over.  Other than that, a true wide-calf, not too wide, but good if you're a little heavy."
"Very funny sweater. However, if you are busty...this is absolutely NOT the best sweater for you. Makes your girls look like they are touching your stomach because the stuffing for Santas belly isn't immediately recognizable."
"I loved this, but I like my bodysuits to be short in length so it hides my belly rolls when I stand up. This was normal length and didn't hide much."
"I'm a male nurse who prefers fitted clothing. I hate the baggy look of scrubs and find them uncomfortable and restrictive. It doesn't help that I'm 6'0 144lbs, with long extremities. These scrubs are amazing. They fit like skinny jeans, well tapered, and stretch almost like leggings. I wear Mediums for little extra space, but they are very comfortable for long 12 hour shifts. They also have a decent amount of pockets. I like to pair them with the Cherokee workwear unisex stretch tops. Loads of pockets, lots of agility, very comfortable."
Very soft just a little lighter than I expected. If you want a heavy absorbent bath robe buy Terry cloth.
I have owned these jeans in the past and they have not disappointed.  Strongly recommend these to anyone who is hard on there work jeans
So in love with these pants!  They are perfect!
"Very nice fabric, substantial. Flattering shaping and very comfortable. I have 2 colors so far."
"The green heart shaped stone is beautiful.  The rest of the setting is mediocre.  The ""hands"" are well done, but the ""crown"" is pretty weak.  Like all(?) Amazon Collection jewelry the chain is absurdly delicate.

This will have strong appeal to some, while others probably won't like it."
Beautiful dresses
BEAUTIFUL COLOR! GREAT FOR WORK
"its perfect for a quick trip. I've used it for Allegiant & Frontier to put under the seat for free. be sure to pack light as it's hard to fit a lot of stuff in it, I've rolled most of my clothes to get more room and it seems to work best for a 4 day trip."
These fit great and look great. I will never go back to ordinary waistbands after wearing the Comfortsoft Waisband!
My son picked these out and was so happy when they arrived! He likes them a lot and says they're comfy.
"My wife likes it very much, though the material is not cotton."
"Great fit. Exceeded my expectations, and I plan on buying another. They are certainly made to be worn under things, or with long shirts. Wish they had another black without the sheen."
Like the watch so much I bought another one for my son.  Keeps great time and looks really good on your arm
Im 53 and 117lbs and 28 weeks pregnant. I got a medium and it fit great. Fabric is thin which is why I got black I didn't want it to be see through. Theres still a bit of room for my stomach to grow.
"We bought two of these coats to use as a family costume (toddler daughter was dressed as a lobster), and it worked out great for that. In fact, this is the real deal, and I might be trying to sell them on Craigslist for some culinary student to take advantage of. I can't believe they were so inexpensive for a good quality chef's coat."
"I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them. I knew they ran small in size though, so I ordered a half size bigger and they fit great."
"Solid shoe for my son. Have had poor experiences with some brands - Nike for one make a great comfortable shoe but just does not last very long. This shoe has been a solid performer - has lasted 6 months so far, showing some wear but not tearing at the seams. Definitely a solid buy for an active kid. Size 5 for my 10yo was spot on."
"Super cute. Higher sheen than I was expecting (think swimsuit shine) but it's totally cute. Easy to pair with anything. Great quailty. If you're looking for a cute ice skater style shiny skirt, you'll love this"
"It fits very well. It wears beautifully, nice and soft. I love the color. It can be worn with everything on a daily basis."
It's definitely a loose fitting garment. But would look nice with just a pair of leggings or even a belt.
I'm an xl woman and the stretch is good if warn under my breasts. Way too small for my hips or waist.
"I was excited about this because 30 pairs for $25 is an amazing deal. I anticipated not liking all of them. Its still an amazing deal compared to Victoria secrets 7 for $28
So I ended up keeping 18 out of the 30
The 12 that i didn't keep are solely because they were too small. Thankfully, most of the ones I didn't love were the too small ones so it worked out in my favor.
On another note, 7 of the 18 I kept aren't thongs. in total 12 out of the 30 aren't thongs.
I might consider ordering a medium/ large size if they offer it because they seem to run on the smaller side even though I usually wear a small more than a medium.
I would 100% order this again"
"These are great flip flops as most Roxy shoes are great. The price is right at 9 or 10 bucks, I bought two pair for my seven year old. The bottom of the shoe is reinforced so they should last through the hard wear of a busy kid"
Very comfortable. I wore them all day but by the end of the day my foot started to slip forward.
"These little soft pants are the best for Baby Chubs.  The 9-Month size fit perfectly, so I wanted the next size up, also.  Bonus bodysuit.  Good colors, good quality.  Washes well.  Go Carters."
"Sturdy, practical chain that holds my heavier pendants effortlessly. Doesn't tarnish because it's stainless steel, which is very nice because it's easier to take care of than sterling silver."
"A litle expensive, but super comfortable.  Waistband is made to lay flat, and the material has a soft and loose feel."
Well-made trunks that look and feel good. I like the size of the pockets and an extra one in the back. Great for hot climate daily wear instead of regular shorts too. Made in the USA!
Totally adorable. Exactly like Barney Stinsons. Decent quality good price.
"Just received these, the length seems a touch longer than with other shoes I have, but fit is fine. Seems of good build, the heel section was a bit harder/stiffer than I was imagining, more so than the ball area of the shoe, I'm thinking it will soften with time. Will report back as time goes."
second set in this style i am buying
So soft and a little larger than others I have purchased.  The longer fit covers more of the foot. Great!
awesome will get years of use out of it and will pass it down to other kids
I was shocked when I received this wig. I did not know that a wig cap would be included. It helped keep the wig in place. I danced with no problems. Good quality for the price.
Perfect inexpensive watch with second hand and lights up in the dark.
Very lightweight and comfortable! I love how soft this is!
"I wish the numbers on the small dials were a bit larger. I tried a watch with a light background, and found the dark background much easier to read. Still not perfect for my eyes."
Well made. Perfect size for every day use. Even bought a DSLR insert to use it as a camera bag.
These boots are so classy.  I was so happy they fit my thighs as I am not a small woman.  They are so soft.
"I bought this bra in a local store, they just had a limited inventory. This price was slightly better."
"In the brown color. I was skeptical when I saw the wedge part was a weird fake wood look. I tried them on and they fit SO well! They did not rub in any spot on my feet, and even though they aren't a very low wedge, you wouldn't know it when you're walking in them. I wore them all day at a kids birthday party (through grass and all) and I was very impressed. I didn't have any ""toe issues"" (anyone with long toes feels my pain) Another positive thing that I adore in these shoes is they don't make a loud clippity clop when walking on hard surfaces.  Anyone on the fence for these wedges, do it! You won't regret."
I cannot say enough good things about these  or this brand in general. Had my last pair of Tevas for about 12 years of heavy use before they finally died. Well made and cute enough to wear with a dress.
The fabric is high quality and the look is cute.
I usually wear a size 38 - Which is usually a Us 7.5 or 8. I bought the 7.5 and fit fine. Very comfortable to walk in a very easy to match
Too tight at the waist and then too long for my daughter. She wore them to school for a while...
"These slip on flats are so light, it feels like you're not wearing shoes! I love the brown nubuck. The color is just right for casual or dress with brown leggings."
"Fit pretty well in 5x.  Was a little tight across the back of my shoulders.  Mostly because other shirts stretch a bit here and this material doesn't.  This is thin material which should be cool.  I do have questions about the construction.  Seams have lots of loose thread, ends hanging out etc.  I halfway thought seams would come loose after a wash.  After two washes they are okay so far.  Still shedding too much thread from seams, but will report if things come apart or buttons fall off in the future.

For a basic inexpensive chef shirt (this is no jacket) it is fine."
"Extra soft, sized accurately, extremely comfortable!"
My favorite jeans - looks good - fits well - long enough rise.
Nice Jeans a little on the dark side but okay.
These are my new favorite shoes replacing my Toms. So comfortable and cute. I was very surprised that I didn't get any blisters. Fabric is soft and just hugs your feet
"If you want a lightweight bag, one that wears well leaving your hands free, and has all the compartments to organize items in your purse,  then this is the bag for you.  Because of balance and mobility problems, it is essential that my hands are free, but that I can easily retrieve items from my purse."
"This bag i gift to my daughter Niti. She is happy with this product. Bag is medium sized and hangs nicely as a cross-body bag. Great organization.
The perfect accessory for an ensemble. This bagg is fabulous, and features two easy-access outside front pockets, an interior with ten credit card slots,pen holder, key, and detachable coin purse, and a large stuff pocket on the back with a hidden magnetic closure and a bottom zipper to convert into a sleeve so you can slide the bagg securely over the handle of your suitcase. Includes a 52"" adjustable strap and is made of lightweight water resistant fabric."
Great quality. Run a bit narrow
"I wasn't sure what to expect from the photos, but this is a really nice looking watch. The blue of the face is absolutely brilliant, and the stainless case frames it beautifully.  It is a rather large watch, but not overly heavy. The band is simulated alligator skin, and has a very secure closing mechanism.  It took awhile for me to figure it out, but don't be like me and try to figure it out without reading  the directions"
"This is a nice sports bra, good support, very comfortable.  It lifts and separates the girls, does not give you a uniboob look.  My only complaint is the band rolls up.  The bra has held up well, and is well constructed. The straps are very comfortable.  I would order this bra again."
"I saw these boots at another retail store and based my decision to purchase these boots on the reviews from that website.  These boots are a perfect mix between casual and dressy - you can wear them with jeans, leggings, and skirts.  The leather feels very luxurious and the gold detail adds just enough flair without being overpowering. I love the almond shaped toe and the heel is perfect.  I have 15.25in calves and these boots fit a tad snug, but I'm still able to wear them with my skinny jeans with no problems.  My feet tend to be on the wider side, however they are not wide enough to purchase wide shoes.  I have noticed that after a few hours, the boots do feel a bit tight, however I believe because of the high quality leather, they will stretch after another wear.  Overall, these boots are gorgeous and I hope that they stretch just a little bit."
"beautiful sneaker. can't say enough good things about it. My only gripe is that it's too big. I'm around a size 11-11.5 in nike, and i wish I ordered this in a 10.5. Other than that it's an A+ shoe"
"This is my first Dansko pair and it won't be the last.  I love it!  I think it's true to size with socks on.  These are work shoes for me and I am on my feet a lot so that tells you how comfortable they are.  Buy now, it's worth the price."
Kind of not comfortable
"I really enjoy this bathing suit! I would have given it 5 stars, but the bust doesn't fit as I had hoped; it is a bit small for a large breasted woman. I ordered a large and the bottoms fit perfect, top isn't obscene and can get away with it, despite it's lack of  'give'. Overall, worth the purchase."
"Great length - high enough so if pant leg rises when I cross my legs only sock shows, but no so high as to be hitting/rolling down under my knees.
Also.. the band around the top is not tight, but the socks stay up.  So many trouser socks dig in to my (average to thin) calves - these do  not.  Will buy again."
"adorable, well made, perfect fit. The colors are super cute: coral, navy and teal."
"I am a pageant girl so I have SOOOOO many crown rings! But this far and above is my favorite! I got it for 33 which was a GREAT DEAL because it's worth a lot more! Many people think that it's my engagement ring. I wear it on my ring fingers, but it would be a great pointer, middle, or pinky ring too!"
Huge bag but that is what I was hoping for. The bag folds into itself and becomes small and very easy to tuck away. It has a long shoulder strap with padding. I was surprised at how thin the material feels. I was expecting a thicker fabric. I will be using this bag for camping and road trips.
"Very cute dress, used for a flower girl. Great price, too!"
Great replacement band. Needed a cheap alternative wedding band while pregnant. Love it!
"Tried "" khakis""  from a lot of brands over the years and these fit me the best. Almost never iron them unless I want to look a little more dressed up. They last me about a year before they show signs of wear but for this price...that's not a problem!"
Very comfortable and size is great!
Good quality t-shirt. Fits great. I love it!
I love my pajamas. So soft and cozy.  There are going to work just right for the winter.
"Fast shipping,  great fit and love the color."
Great swimsuit for a great price. Perfect right out of the package.
"I am wearing these boots now, they are so comfortable and warm and cozy!  I've gotten many compliments on these boots, which are also so practical for winter days.  They are the same as the much more expensive brand.  I love them!"
"It's the dead of winter here so I have not worn these cute sandals out yet. They fit great, but after reading other reviews I went up an entire size. I'm giving them 4 stars because the sole is somewhat thin."
"Love these dresses!! In fact, every time I wear one, I get rave reviews! I am 5'8"", 195, 36DD-34-50, and the 14/16 fits perfectly, even after lots of washes. Seams/fit/finish are great for the price, and they look great, even after I wash/dry them. They pack great and wrinkles come right out. I wore the red/black at a business conference with a blazer during the day, and a sparkly belt at night, and the other one, I wore to take a professional picture, and it conveyed a sense of fun and femininity that was undeniable!

No complaints at all. Shipping was decent, price is crazy low. I am back to buy another, if they have them in my size!!"
"Very slim, attractive and looks well made, especially for the price. It fits 4 cards and several  folded bills in the zippered compartment. It's perfect for use with a small pocketbook (handbag). Very happy with my purchase and it arrived quickly."
Two sizes up before my calf would fit somewhat comfortably.
I love these Michael Kors Rose Gold-Tone Clear Stud earrings. The earrings are a decent size that look great on my kind of large earlobes. They sparkle like diamonds in the sunlight and look quite expensive. Really lovely earrings. Comfortable and very pleased with these earrings.
Just what I wanted in width. Nice band.
Fit as you would expect and super comfortable.
My 2nd pair in different color. Easy to slip on and off. Just enough suppor and very comfortable.
He likes them alot. Says they are comfy. He's hard on socks and so far they are all still in tact. No holes or snags.
So Comfortable and sole is minimalist - love the color
"My feet grew a size this last year, after giving up most heels, and occasionally my ankles swell.  These are super comfortable and cover a bit of my ankle so the swelling isn't noticeable.  The leather is really soft but still feels like it'll last and covers a few more of my foot problems (toes) without being tight.  They are the perfect shoe for me and do not make me feel like I had to give up style for comfort.  I now have two pair and may get a second pair of the black because gladiator sandals are in style every summer without fail.  These are keepers for the long haul.  Highly recommend.  They do run a little loose (I have skinny feet) but are true to size.  The looseness does not affect the comfort or the look.  Also they don't have the built-in standard ""comfort shoe"" extras but are still extremely comfortable.  A++++!"
"Great costume. Great price. Good quality. Not thin, flimsy or cheap feeling. And by ""cheap feeling"" I mean the REALLY CHEAP feeling almost all costumes feel like unless you spend at least $100 on it. But this little costume feels just as good as those do. I did buy a petticoat slip to go under it to make it look ""fuller"". I bought the 4t size and my daughter is 4 & 3 months. And it fit her well. She's also pretty averaged sized for her age I think. I would recommend this costume."
one of the better capes -- has some heft to the material and the collar is padded so holds shape better.
Product as described and looks like the picture. Nixon is my go to for a nice watch. Bought this for my grandpa and he really likes it. Some reviews are bad and not helpful and I didn't let them change my mind and Im glad I did so I hope this helps.
they came just in time for the snow and my son loves them
Love these shoes. Great with dresses and flattering to the legs....
"Very nice gothic cross. I rate 4 stars because the chain is very cheap and flimsy but since I was going to put it on a silver chain anyway, I have no problem with it. The pendant is nice though and definitely worth the price. Would definitely recommend the pendant for anyone who is into the darker side of life"
Love these bows I ordered 2 sets but only received one I am sure it was just a shipping error. I use these for everything.  From hair to packages!  Great quality!
"So they didn't send me the black one that I ordered... they sent me a silver one, with a small black ring around the face.  That's the downside, and that's why one star has been deducted.

That aside, however, this watch is incredibly cool and looks like it should have cost about 100 times more than it did.  The body is substantial-feeling, the automatic winding works wonderfully, and the second hand is a micro-sweep, which makes it look all the cooler and more expensive.  Frankly, it's insane that anyone can sell a watch this nice for such a low cost.  Granted, I've only had it for, what, a month... but so far it's held up wonderfully and I have pretty high hopes of it continuing to do so.

One downside is that the strap itself feels pretty chintzy... way too light, kind of tinny feeling.  It's a weird counterpoint to the heft of the watch itself, and if you ever take the watch off and hand it to someone to look at the clear back or inspect the movement, the strap is what will immediately give it away as a cheap watch.  But that's literally the only clue that it didn't cost $500 or more, so basically... don't take it off!

So far it's been accurate... granted, I don't wear it all the time, so the winding runs down and I have to reset it anyway, so maybe the movement is off and I just haven't run it long enough to notice.  Regardless... incredible watch for the price.  Get it, it looks freaking fantastic and seems to perform the same."
"If you are looking for a very inexpensive pair of sunglasses with a much higher-end look and design then you can't go wrong with these. With 5 lenses to chose from and a great hard-cover protective case you can afford to buy them just to leave in your car, boat or motorcylce as a great back-up pair of glasses. My wife likes hers very much as she can change the lenses to fit the situation for fashion or stick with the polarized lens for when we're on the bike. Good choice and would buy again."
"I prefer for my Toms to be a bit bigger, so i ended up buying the men's version for this shoe. So comfortable and goes with pretty much any outfit. Very happy with this purchase!"
Purchased this for a costume - exactly as pictured.
"I'm actually wearing this right now...perfect when paired with leggings - this has just the right balance between super comfortable and sensible summer style to wear out and about. The fit is perfect - very flattering thanks to a tiny bit of stretch, great comfort even in the heat and humidity of Florida, scoop neck and just a small addition on the back add a bit of fun and flair to this basic long tunic style top. Elongated fit flatters most figures. Washes easily and wears great! Complimentary product provided for evaluation purpose."
"I have the black ones, these is an additional pair in white since they are so comfortable"
My husband's favorite sunglasess
This has become my favorite swtr!  It is simple to slip on over anything and it is nice and warm.
"Loved it. Looks exactly as advertised, sizing was correct as well."
"Cute shirt fits perfect, great quality for the price! I purchased a size XL and that's the size I normally wear."
Its very thin...so the T-shirt I wore underneath could be seen a little bit. But this thing is super cute. My daughter loves it and laughed her butt off! It's super comfy and very soft! I recommend this as a PJ and as the Halloween outfit I bought it for!
"While looking for a different shoe that is no longer produced I found and ordered these.  I am very pleased with their fit.  Having had foot issues in the past I am very particular, especially with flip flops but I can wear them all day.  Luv em!"
"As I get older, my lashes (and eyebrows) seems to get lighter, thinner and fainter. This has made a noticeable difference in my lashes but it is really expensive. What I'm not sure of yet is how long it lasts. Or if you stop using it, does it revert back to old and thin. It's easy to apply."
"Very beautiful ring, just as pictured.  Very sturdy."
the sole of the shoe is hard. but it fit normally
Is a presente that person love it
"Beautiful,  love it!"
"Nice quality and comfort. Fits a little snug because it is slim fit, so it normal to fit ""somewhat small"" otherwise it can be considered ""fit as expected.""  Beautiful color of dark blue and a perfect match the ""Perry Ellis Men's 2 Button Side Vent Suit."" Basically, inexpensive and well worth the price. Not too heavy or warm to wear so perfect for all Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons."
Fits great. it is beautiful and sexy.  I love the box it came in and i will order from this company again.
"Very comfortable hat in hot weather, keeps the sun off my ears and neck."
"I ordered the light sea green.  It is pictured a lovely aqua blue, not green so I was curious what would arrive.  It is the lovely aqua blue shown in the picture.  I'm an hour glass figure and these dresses are usually perfect, but this one was too tight in the bust.  But the fabric was lovely and the dress was beautiful.  If you are a D or DD maybe order up a size, even if it means having to get the waste taken in a bit it would be worth it, the dress was that nice.

Return was a breeze.  I printed off the label and dropped it at UPS store.  They credit your card as soon as the package is scanned into the system, they do not wait till the package arrives back with vendor."
"Stunning Necklace, I got so many compliments on it. I did alter it quite a bit to suit my style though."
Great quality fabric that will surely soften up with wear and washing.  Size XXL fit my husband who typically wears a 2XL tall though it could be a tad bit longer to be perfect.  Love that it's made in Hawaii and the colors/design are vibrant.  Great buy for the price and will be fun for summer parties!
This shirt is so cute the Elmo outline is fussy and soft which makes it even cuter. Nice and bright color and so far hasn't bleed when we've washed it.
"I wear between a 6 and 8.  These fit great.  The only difference for me is the waist. There is a
little play on the size 8 but not too much.  I just love NYDJ jeans."
a real work horse and easy tsppot
"little thinner than others, but exactly the reason i got them..."
Love the elegance of this ring.  Very comfortable to wear and true to size.
"Love this dress, nice enough for going out and yet comfortable for every day wear at home! You can't go wrong with a sakkas dress I have found! The color is vibrant and the material is somewhat hin so on some dresses may need q slip. However if the dress is dark in color you probably don't need a slip only see through ay bottom of hemline. in conclusion, Sakkas has become favorite dress designer and the only thing I enjoy wearing."
"A very strange color. I don't know why I ordered it. But the quality is nice and the fit is perfect. I just wore them on Halloween, but who knows when I can use them again."
"Great price, great product. I wore it all over Paris."
"These boots are amazing!  They fit perfect. I am a hairdresser and stand all day, I am always looking for cute comfy shoes, these definitely fit the bill. The bottoms have great traction.  I am super impressed with them, I hope dr. Keeps making trendy comfortable shoes!"
"Works absolutely great.  Is a little bigger  than I (my daughter) expected.  My daughter loves it though and that's who I got it for, so I am happy.  Good job.  Timely delivery, packaged well, and works as advertised... even better actually.  Thank you."
"No 5 star for a simple fact that after several wash (followed the instruction) the collar show if this was a old T, but otherwise nice T and the fabric feel nice"
"This dress is so cute! I ordered a size up and got the 4x, and it fits perfectly. The material is light weight, and super soft. It has some cute peephole detailing on the top and the pockets, plus a think white belt that goes around the waist. The skirt has a slight flare at the bottom which is think is cute, and makes it perfect to put a petticoat under for an even more vintage feel. I got the black with white polka dots and wore it with black flats, and it was adorable. I received this item at a discount/for free in exchange for my honest review. I never leave good reviews that aren't warranted."
"Nice, but I need more support. Not enough arch support. Size 8N too large. Size 7.5N snug."
"Just right for the weekend trip, if you are going to a warm hot place longer. I love all the organization compartments."
"I love this and my
husband loves seeing
this on me.

Yours truly;

"for the price, good watch, no complaint"
Excellent addition to my summer wardrobe.  They are attractive and comfortable.
I LOVE THESE SHOES! I HAVE 3 PAIRS. THEY ARE ALL I WEAR IN THE SUMMER. SO COMFORTABLE AND GREAT SUPPORT. AND WHAT A STEAL!! 14 bucks a pair!
Love it!!!! Lots of space for cards and cash. Good quality leather. I ordered the large and its the right fit .
It was perfect for what i needed it for! Price was right and it held up good.
Bought for hubby and he is happy with it!
Love it no big bulge in my pocket real thin
"I'm typically a try 6, but ordered one full size up to account for a sock and the fuzzy lining and they fit perfect with no socks."
"Does what it is supposed to. Gives a nice shape. It's a little bit itchy on bare skin, so I recommend wearing a slip under it.

I wear a size 16 in most jeans and the 3x was WAY too big."
"I ordered the XL and they should have fit based on the size chart. I am only 5'4"" and 190 lbs and they fit, but are just barely long enough for me.  No way they would have worked if I were taller.  The material seems sturdy and has a very soft silky feel.  I have only just tried them on, so no idea how well they will wear."
They are really stiff and will have to be worn a lot to get them broken in.
Well made and very light.  I love Travelpro products and have 4 of their suitcases now.
Better than expected.  Dark blue.  Look real
"I made an unwise (in hindsight) decision to buy my first pair of hiking boots 3 days before a long hike.  Fortunately, these boots turned out to be perfect.  I purchased half a size larger than my usual shoe size, and there was generous wriggle room for my toes.  The padded tongue and collar are snug but comfortable, and my feet did not slide around inside the tightly laced shoes.  I hiked up and down steep, rocky, dusty and gravelly hills all day long (wearing cotton crew socks), and did not experience any slippage, toe-stubbing or chafing at all.  I also have a weak ankle, and the shoe offered it really good support and prevent me from rolling that ankle three times.  I look forward to many long hikes in these awesome boots!"
"I bought a few shirts trying to find the right active T-shirt, and this was the definite winner! I bought an XS and it was a true XS with a flattering fit - form-fitting without clinging."
Love them!  Wear them all the time and no complaints!
"My husband loves this ring, comfortable and stylish...."
The leggings fit perfect on me. I am a small size so I recommend ordering a larger than normal size!!! I definitely think I got the better deal here!! Quality is also good!!
"I used this dress for my baby shower, and loved it! It was slightly see-through, however a loose slip underneath the dress will fix that. I bought this dress in Red for my Maternity photos. I got so many compliments.
I ordered a Medium (pre-pregnancy size medium 150lbs 5'3.) Right now i'm 170lbs and it fits perfectly."
Good everyday tote
This coat fit really good on my 5 year old son. However the beanie that comes with it did not. It did fit my 1 year old though! :) The coat is really warm and has two pockets. My son loves it
I had a different style of these shoes for years.  They held up well and are very comfortable. These fit perfectly with my cotton socks and with thicker wool socks.
Great wallet.  Nice quality.
"Love the boots, but they were a full size too small"
I have worn these shoes for years.  They are more padded than today's running shoes but fit my wide short feet perfectly.  I like the big toe box and the stable heel. I am on trails and uneven beach surfaces most of the time and these shoes are reliable and stable.
simple & comfortable flats
cute but uncomfortable after a bit
"Small but holds a ton of stuff!  Money, credit cards, makeup, hand sanitizer, cell phone, a small daily planner,  small notebook and pen, etc.  Car/house keys are on a carabiner which I hook to the strap.  Closure is gold and magnetic. Rings on side for strap are gold, they are cheap looking and maybe in time the gold will flake off.  Strap is adjustable with a lot of leeway for many different lengths.  The imitation leather is very soft, but not sure how durable this will be as only time will tell.  There is no smell noticeable. The blue color is true to the photograph depicting it. I would definitely order this again, but only after seeing how long the product lasts with every day wear and tear.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MINICAT-Roomy-Pockets-Small-Crossbody-Cell-Phone-Purse-Wallet-Bag-With-Magnetic-Button-Blue/dp/B01L8GL98G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MINICAT Roomy Pockets Small Crossbody Cell Phone Purse Wallet Bag With Magnetic Button (Blue)</a>"
These boots are heavy duty and reliable. very warm and cozy inside
My 10 year old loves  them- 4th grade!
the best pj bottoms out there.  comfortable fun and looks great!  loved them so much bought matching ones for my best girlfriend.  when we travel we match! the fit is great.  slightly roomy but makes you look good!
"I love it, wear it every day. Thicker than I thought it would be. I wouldn't pay the full Amazon price though, $70 is too much -- the gold on the edges doesn't look very good and wears off easily. But, if there's a sale, I'd recommend it."
"Bought a pair of these for me and loved them so much I have purchased a second pair for my golfing buddy for Christmas.

They keep my feet comfortable, warm, and dry.  I would advise adding one-half shoe size.  I normally wear a size 9 but bought the 9.5 and am glad I did!"
"This Opal Tiger Eye Oval Pendant is amazing. The size is bigger than I expected but exactly as stated by the seller. This is so beautiful and fell in love with it when I first saw it. The design is great and with the black cord looks good together. This is a perfect gift for a daughter, mother, aunt and grandmother. I did receive this product at a discounted price."
Got well and hold up in the wash...True to size
"I purchased these headbands as a way to keep my hair near and off my face during a recent mission trip in a very warm climate. They worked perfectly! Theyre lightweight, stayed on well and provided a colorful accessory each day."
Fun stocking stuffers that were well received.  Husband wears a size 12 and they fit him fine.
My husband bought this bad as a gift. The bag is beautiful! So elegant and classy. It looks like it cots thousands! I am very happy with my gift.
I use them as indoor slippers for comfort and wear late at night as bedroom slippers.
So cute! just the right size for my son in kindergarten! got it SUPER FAST.....
"original ad said shirt was red,not maroon"
"Beautiful hat, great for my Country music band gigs!"
amazingly perfect and beautiful
Great watch and very happy with the design and the workings of the watch.
"I always had a hard time finding this size at the stores (Target, Walmart ) so I decide to look here on Amazon.  I finally able to ordered size 6 and the package came on time and good condition.  Of course I washed them before wearing it and it's a perfect fit. I will order more."
Cool looking and very comfortable
Really cute and soft. Sized accurately. Boy and dad love.
Really cute for panda lovers
Dritz seems to have the best extenders this is the fourth one I bought now I have most the colors for each my bras.
"The shirt fit well and is very cute. It is a tad see through though, so I would recommend an undershirt or something underneath."
Wife likes a lot and price was very good.
"Very happy...usually buy a 6M, but after reading other reviews decided on the 6.5...since I'd be wearing them in colder weather if they were slightly big I could use a heavier sock. They are not leather but in the cognac they look more leather Iike.  For what I paid they were a bargain. Other sites had them as high as $79.00!!!! Definitely baggy around the ankles and zippers in the back. Good deal in my book. The photo is exactly as they are in person."
Pleasantly surprised at how comfy these boots are and at such a low price.  These are fashionable and appear to be good quality.  The inside fur lining is perfect and doesn't feel too warm.  I always wear a size 9 and these are accurate in sizing.
"First of all we are very comfortable with the Rockport brand so this is already a plus for us.  They really do make an outstanding show.  Regarding this specific pair we are pleased with the lightweight aspect.  They almost feel as though you could forget you have shoes on.  Part of this we attribute to the fact that these shoes actually conform to your foot after a short wearing.
They become your own.
We are quite happy with these shoes being added to my husband's wardrobe."
Excellent - easy to deal with. Product as described. Would deal with again.
"I love these shoes! THey are super comfy for being a heeled boot! I feel like I could walk in the all day (I haven't tested that out yet) I'm waiting for colder weather to wear them and I cannot wait! I have a size 10 foot in most all shoes. (I can wear a 9.5 sometimes) But these fit great! They fit close to the ankle which is nice because sometimes these type of shoes have a huge gap around the ankle that makes them appear too big but these don't. I also have a narrow foot, but they hug my feet nicer with little slidding.

Other Notes:
They arrived earlier than expected :)"
"Everything good, except there were fewer belt loops than previous work to weekend products.  Other than that the fit was fine, nice material, and overall nice pants.  Needs more belt loops."
"It was a gift for my wife. She likes it a lot, it looks good on her. Quality seems to be good, that's enough for me."
I have a pair that I received over the holiday and I have to say I absolutely love these shoes!
came promptly and fits well bought two more
"These boots are a little snug, but they're really warm, comfortable, and fashionable. Really can't get any better and completely worth the price."
"Excellent....love 'em, didn't want to take 'em off at end of the day!!!!!"
"Thin, narrow straps. Cups fit perfectly, too small for midriff"
nice design== just hard to keep clean. durable. laces were a little short for our little man to tie--so we replaced them.overall pleased.jim
Awesome propaganda tool for a classroom!
My little loved it for her unicorn party!
Perfect for a my son who was looking for clever t-shirts for school.
I have had a devil of a time finding shorts that fit right and still look cool.  I love that these shorts are long enough (nobody wants to see my upper thigh!) and yet stylish.  They were perfect for this former skater/current active mother of two.
"Love this bag!  The color is great.  I wanted it for travel and it totally fits the bill.  The two zipper pockets are good for my ipad,magazines, tickets and license and the open inner pocket is good the carry a sweater or food for the plane."
I love my Watch! it fits great and comfy!
Beautiful dress and color. To large at the bust area.
Love these boots and have received a number of compliments on them!
Fits  great!
Gift. Recipient says fits well. Stays on where it is supposed to be
"This was simply a replacement for another earlier model of the Ironman model.  Use it as a primary watch when we are traveling out of the country - never show jewelry unless you are willing to lose it.  Also, use it for my walks around a nearby lake.  The watch does exactly what I want it to do.  The weak spot of the watch is the band.  Because of the way the band is held against the watch body with no give, the plastic on the band near the holes tends to weaken and tear with age.  Thus, the reason for a new one."
"Every year my husband and I decorate our house for Halloween, and every year we dress up as well.  We have a black light that we use on our porch, so we decided that we needed something that would glow when we opened the door and the Beetlejuice costume fit the bill.  For the price it is a great product.  The younger kids weren't too sure, but the older kids and adult knew exactly who he was.  The material is light and did fit him well.  He is 6'2"".  We were a little worried because he does have long arms, but everything fit fine.  I would recommend this costume especially for the price."
"She absolute loved it, it's a sleep shirt, so it's supposed to be big, definitely comfy. Ships fast and great company to do business with"
Great weight to the watch. The black on black color looks very sharp and clean. I am very happy with this watch.
"These are my 3rd pair.  My first pair have gone from Alaska to Central America and are still my backup boots.  I eventually had to replace the zipper on one and it was worth the expense.  My 2nd pair met with an unfortunate accident, and now I'm on my 3rd pair.  They are everything that my first pair are.  I wear them just about daily, from the office to on the motorcycle, to long hikes in the desert.

They're sized accurately and are very comfortable.

These are my all-time favorite boots, and when they wear out, I'll buy yet another pair."
"These were too flashy for my husband who likes all things plain, but I gave them to my dad and he loved them! I thought they looked great on both guys and the polarized lenses are great! We're Suncloud fans at my house! That's all that I buy for myself."
"This listing is for a 1.5mm ball chain. I ordered the 20"" length. It is beautiful. It holds my pendant and looks lovely. it is not a military grade ball chain which is probably a 2mm or a 2.5mm ball chain. I love the Lobster clasp. If you are a woman looking for a chain for your pendant- you are in the right place- if you are a guy looking for something to hold your bling or dog tags look for a 2mm-2.5mm chain with key words Military or dog tags."
This is an elegant scarf and had very rich color combinations.
"I love these shoes.  Despite the heel height, they are very comfortable and great as a walking shoe in the city.  They look nice with any type of jean or pants.  I have them in black, as well, purchasing them initially because they are water resistant and stylish.  I recommend them highly."
"UPDATE  11/7/16: I receive compliments every time I wear this.  Many people write down the name to purchase it later.  It's become my favorite.  My other favorites,  Emporio Armani &  Trsor,  do not have the same fragrance as Burberry Weekend.

*******************
Original review:
Warning...spray lightly. You can always spray more if desired. When I first tried this, I sprayed too much.  It was strong & gave me a  mild headache.

I know that fragrance can smell completely different on one person than another.
BURBERRY Weekend has a fresh, floral scent on me.
After about 3 hours, the floral scent had a bit of spice to it; later, as the scent was wearing off, it became a light, powdery, floral scent.
After about 6 hours, very little scent remained.

I don't usually spray fragrance on my clothing, but decided to give it a try the next time I used BURBERRY Weekend.
Result:  I decided I like this fragrance better if I spray it on my clothes rather than on my skin. It's a bit softer on my clothing, but still smells mostly floral with a touch of freshness.

UPDATE: I sprayed it lightly on my wrist today, & had better results. No mild headache & no strong fragrance, but  a soft,  powdery, floral fragrance remained for about 6 or 7 hours."
I think these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Is a shame we can't buy them in Australia but are worth the postage. I am normally a size 7.5. Ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly. Highly recommend.
Super cute but what I love the most is that they are polarized. Took them out fishing and they were absolutely great against the glare of the sun!'
"Not as thin as what you can buy at Target and other stores. Cute, fits well. Held color after 2 washes."
Got these for my son as a Christmas gift.  He loves them.  We did have to return for a half size smaller.  Seem to run a little big.
I simply LOVE them!! They fit very well and look great.
These are so beautiful - they look like they're worth a million bucks!  They are smaller than a dime and the latch-back hooks are around the size of your earlobe so they don't hang too long.  Perfect and well made!
Size 4 was little too big for my average size 3 year old but it was expected. He loves Spiderman and these are the only T-shirts he wants to wear. The quality is excellent and the prints are vibrant. Very happy with the purchase.
"I get so many compliments on these, summer was a hit because of them. Super comfortable, you can dress them up or down. People asked me where did I get them and where shocked when I told them they were Crocs. Once they come out with a 5.5 beige color I plan on purchasing them!"
"I do like this flip flop.  It is every bit as cushy as the yoga mat flip flop.  The strap is not quite as wide as the yoga mat flip flop, and I do notice the difference between the two styles.  It is still comfortable and I love the color and look."
"I really like the brand but for some reason the shirts that I've ordered all seem to run one size too large. My 12 yr old will not fit into this for at least a yr. But like I said, it is a nice shirt."
This is a fine creature. Roomy in the toe box. Euro-Bohemien look with a good selection of Easter Egg colors..I bought several.
Great dress fit awesome!!
I like the pattern and the fabric feels very nice.
"I have worn Skechers for years as they are the most comfortable shoe I have found.  Would definitely purchase again.
They fit just as advertised.  Because they are a relaxed fit there is no pinching or need to break in the shoe."
"Comfy, don't deny yourself."
"This is an awesome and well made polo shirt, and the theme of it of course is amazing. Somehow, I was so afraid of the color, cause in the picture seems like a blend of black and brown and this was a gift for my boyfriend. He like the dark colors so i went for it anyway. Lucky for me this end up been some kind of black and olive green blend. The boyfriend like it very much. But if you don't enjoy this blend of colors, you now aware. Everything else is a joy!"
"First off, I want to state that this product came super fast.

I love this bra. I have been wearing it as a regular bra everyday, sometimes I forget that I am even wearing a bra. This bra is so comfortable and I don't have to hassle with pulling it up at all. The only thing that I do not like is that it was just a bit tight. I ordered a 34C and it felt more like a 32C. I intend on losing a little weight, so it is not so much of a problem to me.

Hands down, the best bra I have even bought."
These are perfect for when you are planning to lose some weight but haven't gotten to it yet. Or if you tend to go up and down a few pounds easily.
its adjustable so it fits smaller heads
They are great but too small I will be sending them back.
For the price u can't beat a Timex watch. 
Excellent shoes Love ir!!!!!
"The socks are a little big for a women's size 7, but my friend loves the socks so that's all that matters"
I love how soft these leggings are.  I bought for Valentines week at work. I work in an elementary school.
"Nice, breathable material. Fit as expected."
"Beautiful stone, strongly made, and WELL WORTH the price. Delicate and sturdy."
These are exactly what I expected/just as advertised. They fit my son's feet very well and do not fall off.
"Cool ring, looks a lot like the picture, but you can tell that the casting used is getting old as a lot of the detail is soft. It's most definitely a recast of a recast. Still, for the price this ring is a winner."
I honestly love this night gown. Its beautifully made. It is the right length (it goes down to my ankles) washes up real nice and the size is 100 percent spot on. I will order more of this brand!  I highly recommend!
I can see during the day now
This dress is absolutely gorgeous! It's much nicer than I thought and he quality is excellent.
Love them.  I ware them all the time and just love them. I also have a pair of white leather ones I have wore a hole in them.  Just buy them you will love them too
These are a little shinny for me but they are a really good value for only $17.99. They fit great and I love wearing them.
"I usually wear a medium (I'm a size 6/8) but decided to go with the Large. I've never had a shirt fit so weird before- it's a bit loose in the chest, bottom and shoulder straps (straps tend to want to slide down). Yet, somewhat tight in the armholes (near the armpits). It's baggy in the waist, but if you're curvy then it will cling to your chest and hips. Overall, it's not terrible and it does look pretty cute."
Love curl duds. Thanks for prompt delivery
Very nice. And great price. I like the simple design and that its very bendable so I can adjust as needed.
Loved them but too large. I wear 7 half to 8. 7 half way big!
Love them so comfortable
"Fabric is delicate, will start tearing out and shedding if you're not careful. Haven't even washed once and it already has visible fabric fuss coming out."
"I got these shoes for my wifey she was so happy and they are a great fit, not to mention how comfortable they are. She has been wearing them for about a week and she loves them. They are very easy to clean warm damp cloth is all you need."
Looks just as pic no balls on fabric as others complain. I'm 5'5 128pd they fit comfy not tight room to work out in.
"The moment I tried these jeans on, I fell in love with them. Most Levi's pairs seem to sit below the waist, which is frustrating when browsing in a store. I just don't like that style. I purchased this pair specifically because I wanted to try something that fits at the waist. It was exactly what I expected. The whole seat area feels extremely comfortable and fairly roomy, sitting, standing or doing whatever. The back of the waistband does not fold 'open' when sitting, especially with a belt, which I really like.

The dark Tumbled Rigid color is nice. Looks like a standard pair of black jeans, nothing more, nothing less. I expect the darker Black color to be too dark.

From now on, I will exclusively buy sits-at-waist Levi's styles and probably nothing else when shopping for jeans."
"My dother, demonstrated how good was this backpack every day during school time. I am pretty satisfied and i will buy another one."
"I love these boots so much. Their style is everything I've been wanting and more, but more importantly, they seem to be very well made. I've been wearing them on a fairly frequent basis for 6 months...very comfortable to wear and very durable."
I got this for my 2 1/2 year old for Halloween. I tried it on when we got it and it seems to fit perfectly. He should still fit in it for Halloween since its just over a month away. He absolutely loved it and didn't want to take it off. It is VERY soft and comfortable but it does shed blue stuff everywhere and is hand wash only.
"This is the 2nd bra, they fit great and I will buy more of them. I would recommend them to others. I got this product @ Amazon.com It's a great site I'v purchesed A coffee pot, Shoes and bra. the shipping is great and fast."
"I received this necklace in adequate protection in a plastic bag, that was then packed in a silky, draw-string bag, then in a box to protect it. It arrived with other purchases.  I love the design, and it looks lovely combined with another silver and turquoise necklace that I have."
"these crocs fit a little tighter across the top, love the shoe though, but, didn't keep them."
Absolutely a perfect sandal have the taupe color had to get the red size 8 is my perfect merrell fit!
The item was received on time and it was not damaged. It came in a small box that was in an envelope shipper. The cubic zirconia diamonds and zirconia blue stones match well together. It is more sparkly then the picture. It fit fine on the wrist and was not tight. It can be worn casually or with a more formal outfit. I have worn with both styles and it was not too much for either one. I would highly recommend this customer bracelet to add to any collection.
These are more comfortable than my tennis shoes.  I wear them all the time!
"I wore them for a Halloween costume, but I could also see wearing them to the opera or symphony for a little razzle dazzle."
This is a nice bra with great support and great color. The only thing I'm unhappy about is one of the hooks for the strap keeps coming off.
"Bought these for my 10 year old daughter, size 11, as she runs partial marathons before school.
She is a kids, so wears through shoes quicker than normal, but I think these lasted a school season and she liked the melon color.
Asics have always been my go to shoe for running and I haven't been disappointed yet, other than longevity being a little shorter than norm.
It would be nice to have some sort of anti-odor/bacteria insole on these.
I did not receive a discount on this product for my honest opinion, I paid full price for the item."
I really like this shoe although I should of followed the reviews about them running small.  I had to return the first pair.  Overall I am totally satisfied with the purchase and would get another pair.
I love this purse! It's starting to get warmer out and I really needed a smaller cross body bag to switch from my fall duffle. This bag looks exactly as pictured!! I've received tons of compliments on it and the price was great!!!
"As a short woman (5'2"") it's hard to find a robe that fits.  This one is a little large but still wearable because it doesn't slouch in the front and gape when I sit down.  The material is heavy enough to stay put when I tie it around the waist.  It comes down somewhere between the ankle and the knee and the sleeves fall to the middle of my palm.  The material is very soft and not too thick.  It is great for year-round wear in California.  I washed it and dried it at high temp but it didn't shrink."
"Very comfortable. I routinely get heel pain with other shoes, but this one is really comfortable and has served me well so far."
I would have been reluctant to buy these sight unseen but they are a variation on a shoe I'd been very happy with.  Price wasn't a steal but very much in line with what I paid for the ones they're replacing.  They're as comfortable as sneakers but look a little nicer.
I Love my shoes  very good quality
"At 11.99 a six pack, I wasn't expecting premium quality. Although advertised as a cotton-polyester blend, beware that these are 100% polyester socks. My iZod blended socks, which I purchased a year ago on Amazon, are no longer available. I figure that a year or two out of these socks will be good, since they are part of my sock rotation;)"
the ONLY reason its not 5 stars is because its EXTRA shiny BUT even with that it IS a great look....looks EXACTLY like the photo I am going to change the top but it looks OK with the skirt I just have one  I like better...This skirt is REALLY cute though and stretchy BUT form fitting LOVE this outfit for summer
"I love this thing! Will be buying more. True to size, extremely soft, not bulky and it does provide a layer of warmth. Don't go crazy expecting a sauna suit effect here - it's lightweight. Good to wear under a light sweater on an extra cold day or for layering. Very nice close fit to the body."
Such nice dress pants. I get many compliments on these. I wear them to work in the corporate office and pair them with a dress top or business coat.
Great style and quality. I just don't like the seam in front.
"I FEEL IN LOVE INSTANTLY!!!
the tassles are not as long as advertised but  it reallt wasn't a problem....it is very flattering!!!"
Sent back because it hurt my foot across the toe area.  I liked the color and style otherwise.
Nice watch.  Wish face was a little bigger
"These were supposed to be light stonewash.  I found the color to be a littl dark.  That aside, these are really well made, more than your money's worth, jeans"
"Very pretty. Very simple. Very elegant. Perfect size. I'm wearing it now, wear it always, and I'm happy.  Nothing much else to say."
Super cute but too small for this fat bitt
"Great Boot,fit as expected"
"Good quality shirts.  Love the hemmed waistline, but very easy to pop/stretch the stitching when putting on or taking off."
Great wedges!
The band is a bit tight but otherwise I love it. This bra is perfect for FOB ladies without very much projection. 4 stars instead of 5 because the shape isn't the best for me but still looks great.
I absolutely love these earrings! They are so pretty and sparkly. I have worn them several times already. As soon as I opened the package I couldn't resist trying them on. I have even fallen asleep wearing them and they were so comfortable. The only tiny thing that bothers me is that the infinity signs are hard to grip when you are trying to take the backs off to remove them and I have pinched my ears more than once. It is a very minor complaint though. Buy these earrings you won't regret it. :)
This is a lovely handbag. The leather is smooth and the lining and stitching are of excellent quality. I took one star because of its weight. It is heavy. Heshe makes great bags and I just ordered my second one.
These sandals are a great mix between casual and summer dress. They fit very well and are comfortable.  I wanted something that I could wear with shorts or with jeans during the summer and these are perfect.
"They are clog with an inner liner bed that feet me well!
I've gotten the same size in different styles and colors
and find the fit to be essentially the same. The leather does
ease out. I start with thin socks initially then got to regular
weight. Doubt I will ever go back to non-clogs. I especially
like the features of this style... look good and feel great."
"This is the best shoe in my closet lol, your on top of the world in these and are very noticeable. I normally wear size 8 but I purchased a 7 1/2 and they fit perfectly. The material is nice and I love the style,  it is also very comfortable to walk in."
I love them. Like sketchers tennis shoes and other shoes they have great support and I love wearing flip flops. Helps with my spine problems. Use to wear Tevas until I found these.
Such a great buy! Hugs my curves in all the right places.
"Very cute & appear comfortable. She immediately was able to wear them all day with no blisters. I like that they can get wet too, although giving 4 stars because I haven't had them long enough to see how well they hold up and I noticed a few threads come loose already (might be no big deal but can't tell yet."
Perfect and great quality. I love it but it does smell funny.
"Soft, comfortable and safe all in one. Love the colors as well"
"Nice shirt, good cotton feel that I like, neck fits snug but I wear 17 1/2 in shirt size. Washed twice in hot water and no shrinking to speak of."
"Very nice gloves, but a bit big, already ordered a smaller size, first pair will make a great gift..."
These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I get compliments on them all the time. I actually now have 3 pairs in 3 different colors I love them so much  I'm very pleased.
Most comfortable jeans I own!!! Tried to buy more but none in my size!
"Update: This far, the clasp has not been an issue.  Both my wife and I like this.

Having recently bought this bracelet for one of my wife's anniversary presents, I really wanted a 5* product.  However, two things caused me to throw caution to the wind:
1.  I had already purchased a matching necklace with a large pressed flowers pendant.
2.  This was a Deal of the Day Lightning Deal for a reasonably good price.

I want this to be fantastic, However, after reading review after review about the clasp, I will warn my wife about a potential problem."
"Good fit, very comfortable as Sketchers always are."
"Comfortable pants but have quite an odd odor to the elastic. I washed them multiple times to get rid of the odd stench. However, still nice sweatpants!"
"I bought these as a gift, they look good on him and he seems to find them comfortable. I have trouble finding the right styles and sizes for him, so this works well for us."
Fresh shoes for me. I like! Thank you
Finally! Footie socks that DONT slide off my feet.
My 2 year-old daughter gets compliments every time she wears this outfit. It is super light and cute. I am going to buy more.
Love them and they are comfy too.
My son said that his Adidas shoes are great and I don't regret ordering them for him.  They arrived in great condition.  They look and feel great.
"grwat fit, looks good with jeans and heels."
"I just started working out for the first time EVER. I bought a few pairs of workout pants when I started, but they were a lot more expensive. But now it's been several weeks and i haven't missed a session so I decided to treat myself to these pants.  The pants are great and inexpensive enough for me to buy a pair in each color.  Now i don't have to do laundry every other day ... LOL. I recommemd these workout pants."
"I bought these for my adult daughter who wears them in all kinds of weather, so I guess she finds them comfortable!"
I liked this shoe so much so I o.rdered it in black also
"Super light weight and super easy to pack and tote to the gym.  Strap is adjustable, so the bag can be slung over the shoulder.  I've been using it for two weeks and its working out great!  Very happy with this purchase!"
"Good quality working out pants, it's not comfortable though with the metal zippers above the feet."
Bought as a swimsuit top to cover scarring on arms. I would like it better with a V neck.
These slippers are extremely comfortable and extremely well constructed.  Very good value for the money. Compared to similar styles from brand names these slippers are certainly a step above the rest.
I always Bought Fruit of  the Loom always Fit Well and lasts many Years
Once you wear this you'll see why it's so comfortable.  Had a bit of trouble getting my foot in because of my high instep but with the help of a shoehorn it was fine. The footbed is very soft but the top of the shoe is also. ly problem for some people is that there is no way to tighten the shoe if it doesn't fit properly. Runs true to size which is great especially when you buying on line.
"Lovely heels. Elegant, well made, and well priced. Comfortable and very flattering: they look equally wonderful with a gown or with jeans and a t-shirt."
"For being cheaper and being a pack of bras, these are really good. In my experience, these bras are not the most comfortable (small things, like the fabric at the band feeling a bit scratchy). Otherwise, these bras are the best deal I could have gone for, and they fit my size needs [40B].

I definitely recommend these to anyone who is tighter on cash but needs decent bras."
"these will become one of my favorite pairs of underwear. After reading reviews I ordered a size smaller and it was a good idea. They fit perfectly. The pouch is great and unlike typical underwear leaves room so it's not smooshing your bits all the time.  It's very ""revealing"" but that's good LOL"
"Size d down from an XL to a L, and was still too roomy.  Still, a good value for the money"
"I love love this ring! It's gorgeous quality, it doesn't feel heavy or to thin! I would recommend this ring if you love owls"
"It works well with jeans or khakis. It's very casual looking. The buckle is exceptionally substantial adk keeps (so far) a great grip on the belt fabric. We will see how well it works after a year or two of near-daily wear. The infinite adjustability is one of the main reasons I bought this belt. For some reason, I seem to always find myself ""between holes"" on ordinary belts, either just too loose or just too tight.

I like the shape of the fabric end. It is not square - one corner is cut in order to ease threading through belt loops and the included keeper. The keeper itself slides along the belt material and can be positioned to best hold the loose end. You don't want to lose it as it is not attached."
"These boots feel amazing to walk around and having great grip. Super sleek design compared to most boots. A huge step up from hiking in trail runners, feels a lot more secure when walking over roots or rocks and being waterproof helps with the mud on trails after it rains. You can just plow through any terrain. These things just stick to the ground. Took them camping with me on Montage Mountain for Camp Bisco and these things ate up all the rocks and mud the mountain threw at me."
"The heal was too loose for my 93 yr old Dad's foot, so I had to return. Company was excellent!!!!! Sent out a return postage receipt, I dropped off at a UPS store and they issued credit. Shoes are hard to order for someone else but I will try again with shoe buy. Totally took care of me"
Wonderful fit and feel-  highly recommend
"Perfect fit. I wear a 6/7, these are 7, and I couldn't be more pleased with the fit and material. Will be buying more. They were delivered on time and they were as shown in the picture."
"These shoes are a great shoe, a little large, order 1/2 size smaller.  I wear socks so pretty ok.  Love the style and non slip sole."
I always order a large volume of these exact socks and use 10 pair at a time and switch them out when I wear a hole in them or they stretch out of shape. They are perfect for my use of them.
These socks are so cozy and warm. The colors are great and have several sets to choose from. I was worried about all of the different kinds of yarn in the sock bugging me but you don't feel the variations making the design at all. I'm going to buy another set or two.
"Looks just like the picture, great fit, great quality and excellent price!"
"Looks sharp, easy to adjust."
Look great. Fit good.
Omg i love these.  So soft. Fit great. Best athletic socks I've ever owned!
"Perfect costume, fits great, looks great, decent material as far as halloween costumes go. No complaints here!"
"I can crouch and workout with Joggers as long as they have a double seam on the inner area. Joggers pants are durable, because of the cotton and one fabric construction. I'll get more colors later on."
"Bought as a gift for my husband and he loves them! They are a heavier weight than his other cuff links, which he likes.  Great quality product with intricate detailing.  Beautiful... yet manly ;-) & unique. Highly recommend!"
"I love the fit and style. One hot pair of heels. They brought me a lot of attention, exactly what I wanted. I usually wear an 8 1/2 but these fit fine with hose on. I also wear an arch support insert, that fit fine also."
Amazing fit. Great look. SUPER comfortable. I wear these 8 hours a day on my feet shooting weddings and they're great. They go great with jeans or chinos. Highly recommended.
WAY COMFY!
"my pinky toes try to slide out the sides, other than that, I wear these comfortably at work all day long ( I sit at a desk). Received many compliments!"
"I changed my review from one to four stars.  The watch did stop working recently and needed to be recharged.
Found that it required a larger recharge time (three days) but now it is keeping the correct time.
Did not wear the watch for a few months and kept it indoors. The battery must have been completely discharged.
This Seiko watch was a good purchase."
My daughter has special needs and I bought these to serve as uniform pants at school. She has trouble fastening buttons so these worked out great. The elastic on back let's me tie these loose enough so that she can just pull them up herself. Independence comes one small step at a time!
"Great wallet for your handbag or carrying by itself!  Well made leather, beautiful design and all the card slots and money sorting my wife needed!"
"Love the hats, keep one for myself and the other for a gift! Would buy again so cute! Great quaility!"
"I had to order a 1/2 size up. I can normally wear an 8 1/2 to a 9, but needed a 9 and a 1/2 in this particular shoe. I have another pair of 515's that are size 9 and fit well."
"When I first opened it, I was a little taken aback that it fit so close to the body but after a few days of wearing this, it feels really nice. It's very lightweight that I wear it all day. And the major sticking point: the pockets are DEEP ENOUGH that my cell phone fits without fear of falling out. Definitely will stay in the rotation. Good investment."
They are very comfortable I ordered 1/2 size larger and they are perfect
"These shoes are about as minimal as you'll get with good OCR shoes. I prefer to have a more natural feel when I run so these are perfect, they drain quickly, stay comfortable and let me feel the ground when I'm running. I don't know how they would work with additional arch support but as is, they're perfect for me."
This sweater is fine. The seems are on the outside and its rather thin. But it is comfortable and cheap.
"fits great, looks great! not much else to say."
"Very cool top. I took the advice of many reviewers regarding size, and though I usually buy small or medium this time I went for the xsmall and it was a winner. I purchased the turquoise and received it right away. I would have also gone for the royal but delivery is too far off, I don't like long waits when I shop."
They're very comfy
"No need to size up or down in these. They fit great & are comfortable. Not a ton of padding on the insole, but you can always add an insert. I love how these shoes look. They're extremely cute. I'd definitely buy these again!"
"After reading the reviews, I decided to buy a size larger than I usually do. I'm so glad I did because the size up fits me perfectly. They were a little scratchy at first but now that I've washed them 3 times, they're getting softer. The color is just as pictured and is just what I need for my upcoming schooling. I would recommend these to others but make sure to order a size larger than you typically do."
"Colour is lovely, but the shoes are a little large."
"Very, very comfortable wear them constantly and will buy again. Ordered normal foot size."
Most comfortable sneakers ever!!!!!!!!
Love these bracelets.  I have lots of snaps that match nicely!
Bought to wear under a short skirt costume. Run small. Buy one size up.
"I like the watch ...keeps good time and looks good but would have much preferred a white vs silver face.

The other thing is the long sweep second hand seems to only work in the stopwatch mode vice the normal time-telling mode I always use.

Wish Casio still made the AMW320R-7EV....simplicity at its best."
"They fit well and they're cute

The quality is decent

You can probably find something more high end looking, but you're going to be paying a lot more for designer furry boots

These are good for the price

I like them! They're very cute, I got them in black

I have never had this style and they're the perfect height. Love the fur trim in layered colors

Looks really animal-inspired and ruggedly chic

Pair with a sweater and black skinnies"
My brother told me about these so I bought them for my boyfriend and he was so excited.  He's always between belt loops or wearing them out.  Best belt (and gift) ever.
Live these eating not too big or too small
"I just started running a few weeks ago. I ran 2 miles each time , 5 times a week with a pair of old sneakers . Only a week later, I got my  left  knee hurt. I could barely go down the stairs for 2 weeks. So I decided  to buy a  new one. I've only run several hundreds meters so far  and I felt a little tight. I'll try them for longer running next week."
These are so cute.  They go with so many more colors than I realized.  They fit as expected and are comfortable.
LOVE THEM!  Most comfortable shoes yet!
"Fine strap, should have ordered extra long, but this will work."
My daughter looked gorgeous in this. It is of the quality that you could become an Elsa character to perform at birthday parties and such. So beautiful.
"Perfect baby diaper! Snap-on option is nice as it's easier to put on a squirming baby.  Nicely padded, holds any accidents in.  We have not had any accidents so I'm not sure how great it will wash out, but very happy with purchase."
"Rain gear always runs a little big
but thats fine - a longer wear time in this age is AWESOME
GREAT QUALITY - an amazing design."
Great shoes. My 9 year old is loving them.
Wifey wants more. Fits perfect. The color and description is as pictured.
I love this little wallet.  I've received several compliments on it as well.
Fit a little snug but I loved it. It was a hit at the Halloween party!
"Nice pair of flats. Fit was a little tight and color was too greyed out for me, but they seemed comfortable (if I'd gotten a bigger size) and well made. Ended up returning."
"I bought this Full Freedom in a 38 Cafe (I wear a 36-38D) during my search for a sleep/ lounge bra. Ive decided to be a bit more active in trying to prevent any late age sagging. I love how it feels! The material, stretch, and fact that the its front closure so hooks don't dig into my back, make this one of the most comfortable bras Ive ever tried. I read reviews of people have trouble hooking the eyelets in the front, but I think its pretty easy. I latch the top then bottom first, then do the middle ones bottom to top. The lace cover on the closure is a nice touch. The only negative is how little it actually supports, but thats probably why its so airy and comfy. I wish the arm straps were shorter so that they enabled the cups to support more. All-in-all an amazing sleep bra."
"The fit is just right if your not wearing heavy socks, I would recommended ordering a half size lager If thick socks and warmth is what your looking for. I have gotten several compliments and they are very comfortable to wear all day. I'm very pleased with this purchase and they were delivered in a timely manner as well!"
Excellent slip on comfortable shoe.
"These are really cute, the material is super soft and light weight. Perfect for the price.  I will make good use out of them year round!"
"Super cute. I think they would've been comfortable, but they were too big. I returned them. I went with the suggestion that they run small, but they do not. They fit as all Dr. Martens fit. True to size."
"I was surprised as usually fleece pajama bottoms are junior sized and I have to buy an XL for a comfy fit.  I am 125 5'4. I purchased them in Large but could have fit into a medium.. Probably could have fit into a small...these are generously sized.....The material is very nice, not to thick and super soft. They have an adjustable drawstring and elastic waist band and a high rise (approx 11 inch on the large size)  They are a bit long for me.  I'm happy with this purchase.."
Samsonite rarely disappoints. Wife has used 2 of the bags thus far and was overjoyed. Recommend them to you as well.
"I love this bag! It is beautiful, well made and functions just as I wanted. I wanted a bag I could use for a combination purse and diaper bag. This is perfect! The design of the purse allows me to slide it to the front of my body to access the contents without have to take the purse off. The size is exactly what I needed to fit my purse contents plus a few diapers, wipes and change of clothes for my baby with some room to spare for a book and a small toy."
This was a great little dress. The fabric is nice and looked just like the picture. I have washed it several times and nothing has shrunk or warped. My daughter was 3 months when she wore it and it fit perfectly. She is a taller baby at 24 inches and 14 pounds.
go get yours you'll love it.
"fits perfectly, feels great and keeps em warm!"
My wife likes the bag very much
Very attractive. Very comfortable. Good support for walking. I'm very pleased with these boots.
Outside shell not as substantial as I hoped.
"This is a very pretty bra.  I was looking for wireless brallettes that aren't just made for teenage girls, and this is just the right one.  The cups are molded and may be a bit more padding than what I was hoping for.  They are small and fits me just right (34A/B).  For girls who have larger chest, this may not fit well. The lower band fits me just right (snug but not tight).  The straps are a little short for me since I am a little on the tall side (5""8).  They are stretchy but not adjustable so the cups were ""pulled up"" over time.  Had to tug them down a few times during the day.  I can see how this can cause discomfort for taller girls.  I wore it for a 12 hour day.  It felt very comfortable.  It's a great buy.  And I just have to say this again that the lace is very pretty.

Update:  After owning this bra for a month, I have to point out the straps are probably too short for me.  So I would advice for women taller than 5'6"" to be aware.  Nevertheless, I don't mind tugging down the band a few times a day...  I haven't found any other brallette that would work better...  So still good for me."
Got this for my husband and he LOVED it!!! Awesome
really like the wallet. I have too many credit cards but i can carry the ones i want to in this wallet. really nice quality and the leather is real soft. A very good buy and the best wallet i have had in a long time.
Sent this to my sister for her birthday.  She sent me a picture of it and it was just as beautiful and it is on the website.  She was very happy.  Good product at a great price.
"Classy, comfortable, low heeled shoe in a,hard to find, dark shade of pewter - neutral and very wearable."
Fantastic box for a important gift. Very pretty. Fast delivery.
"I'm pleasantly surprised with the overall quality. As others have said, you get a lot for the price. The pants are a bit thin, but it looks and feels overall better quality than what you find in a lot of party stores. The hat was folded but it doesn't look too bad. I might try to straighten it a bit but it wouldn't look bad as is. Looking forward to wearing it for Halloween."
"Sweatshirts are very comfortable , fit well just enough room so when they shrink in dryer they will be perfect.seem to be well made ."
"Spectacular value. I ordered very expensive rings to marry and my wife didn't like the gold ones (~$1,000), she actually preferred these. So we returned to gold ones and kept these as our wedding rings. After that, my dad, and several cousins asked me to buy similar rings for them. They are heavy and very beautiful. They are stronger and more scratch resistant than actual gold. I would buy them again any time. I highly recommend them. They are VERY heavy, I love that, but some people might not like that."
I'm 6 months pregnant and was tired of the drawstring scrub pants I had been wearing. These pants are comfortable and hold up the entire shift without sagging. True to size and a little cheaper than maternity scrub pants.
Perfect for the pacific NW weather.
The sleeves are tighter then normal Tshirts and I have thin arms.
"I have used these for 7 years now and am sold.  The polymer gasket does get stiff after a few years and eventually crack, but if you keep it out of the dryer and air dry instead, they last longer."
"I ordered these for a wedding. They need to be comfortable enough for me to wear for hours and I am a mom of young children so I need to be and moving around a lot. They are so comfortable and cute and I can wear them for many different occasions, church, work, date night, etc. I ordered the luggage and it is a little darker then I wanted but still very nice neutral color."
"shoes are well made.  when i first got them, they felt small on my feet but now after several wearing, they stretched and mold onto my feet and feel just wonderful!  very comfy.  Buy exact size and it will fit after couple of wearing."
Beautiful! Looks like true jewelry! !! I'm very satisfied!!!!
I personally love the mask! It looks great. Obviously its a little hard to see out of but the wholes in it do enough to get around. The only problem I have with it is that the latex smells kinda bad. Other than that its hilarious!
"Shirt is nice, fits well."
"Love this bra,  price is awesome.  Fit is perfect,  I don't sag or bag,  it keeps things where they should be,  up! It's gorgeous! And not itchy at all. Very soft."
My husband seems to like them!
"I recieved this watch yesterday and am absolutely pleased with it so far. This is my first automatic watch and to get one at this price is unbelievable. It's extremely comfortable to wear and is a perfect size for an everyday watch. Since it's not clearly listed this is a an ETA 2834-2 movement, which is a self-winding automatic movement. This movement is found in many far higher end watches, making this watch an absolute bargain considering its under $500. If you're looking for a great looking automatic watch to wear every day this is the watch for you. It's a humble piece, unlike some of my Invictas, but very classic and well crafted. I couldn't be happier!"
"Were a little tight through the calves, but after a couple of days wearing with hose, I can now wear them with wool socks."
"Needed a nice jacket for fall and this fits the bill.  Great fit, washed nice, just right for car seat riding."
"I bought it for my husband for his birthday, which was a week before our trip to Alaska. The hat is very comfortable and warm. Just what he wanted!"
"Another little outfit I purchased for my little grandaughter.  Nice quality, fits well, comfortable fabric, well worth the cost.  Precious little item."
warm but not too thick
I  just received my watch in 24 hours Waoooooo!!!!!! I love it  beautiful . Amazon  Thanks your the best
"Grandaughter is 4t, order a 5 and fits great!
Just as pictured, great quality!!"
Happy for my little niece they are  very nice
"I love Sketcher shoes! They do run big, so I always buy them half a size smaller. They are so comfortable and well made! I own many pairs of Sketcher shoes,  I'm on my feet all day, and these are by far the most comfortable brand I've ever purchased."
Fit as expected it's a free size
Noting
"Very nice wallet, lots of room. And Happy to feel safe from potential thieves that once stole my dads credit card info just by walking by. What a mess that was!"
This is a great inexpensive cute boot for your non walker. They don't stay on the foot as well as I had hoped. But what more can u expect out of a $6 boot.
"Love, love, love these!  They are so comfortable and fit perfectly.  They seem pretty durable as well.  I will be buying different colors.  After a few times wearing them, they are beginning to stink a little, which I guess should be expected, but they are not the easiest things to clean.  Still love them however, and will buy more in the future."
"I liked this hat.  I bought it to use as a base to embellish for Derby.  It was exactly as I expected.  However, it was a little too big, but most hats are.  I fixed this easy enough by buying some sizing strips.  Loved the way it turned out."
Love all life is good t-shirts.
"I love these shoes. I had a brown pair and was panicking because I could not find them in black. Then I checked Amazon, score! I Have back, hip and leg problems but I can wear these shoes all day with no problems. The arch support is excellent and the shoes, while looking nice under pants give me a feeling of strong support. Will need to buy news ones soon because I do not wear any other shoes now."
"So cute but too tiny for a school back pack, can't fit a regular folder in it."
Great purchase. I love my watch and wear it everyday
"I love my new minimus Running shoes. I got the yellow/blue and the colors are fantastic, just like the photo online. Item is exactly as described. Light weight and barefoot friendly. They're very comfortable even on gravel, which I tend to come across a lot where I live. I get lots of compliments from folks who like them. They're not just great running shoes but great to work out in them. I wear them even when I'm not running or working out, I love them that much. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
"Love these shoes! Fit is great! Waterproof, too!"
"Love em', better than I expected.  I'm 5'10 my weight is 130. They fit perfect in the large. Long enough! Really pretty and fabric is awesome."
A great first jewelry box for a young girl.
"Awesome wicking socks great for hiking or work.  Sturdy and long lasting, haven't had an issue since I bought my first pair 3 years ago."
Love it!  Will be ordering more.
I'm a 36 D and I hate strapless bras because they hurt the upper rib cage and always fall down. This doesn't do either. It's awesome. I recommend it to everyone!
"I love these shoes.  As others suggested, I ordered a size larger than normal, and they fit great.  I've been putting 15 or so miles a week on them for a few months, and still think they're wonderful."
"Really well made and thought-out shoe design. For example, the large band that goes across the top of your foot actually connects between the heel and insole. This is great since the bottom of your foot doesn't rub against the leather band. I liked the style of this shoe and bought another similar shoe by a different company, but their leather actually connected on the insole. Yikes! I would have had blisters for months ""walking"" on that band. Good design, Ugg."
"Very pretty ring, big and wide, with lovely detailing. Used for a costume so I've only worn it a few times."
My daughter in law  loves these. They are soft and plenty big. My grandson is 4 months old and 20 lbs. I ordered the 12- 18 month size.
Love them  !!!!
"When I opened the packaged and looked at the dress, I thought what an ugly dress! The color was not as I expected BUT, when I tried the dress on what a big difference! The dress is sexy but so classy looking and  so I am keeping it! I love the shape of the neckline with the little collar (if that's what the part behind the neck is called). I like the dress!"
very happy with TOMMY HILFIGER
Bought for my kid. They fit above the knee and hold up well. They have an inside pocket and strings on top to keep them on.
Nice but very  very long. Have to bend a lot
"My Dr advised to wear orthopedic shoes due to bad back, knees and hips.  So I searched for shoe brands that were not completely without style.  I found Docs.

For me the hardest part of breaking in Dr Martens is the top part of the foot, so the hard leather takes a long time to break in.  This patent leather is much softer, so they require almost no break in time. No material on the top of the foot means no break in time.

At first I thought the soles were more flexible than hard leather docs.  So I got out a pair and flexed it.  The structure of the shoe makes it feel less flexible, but they flex the same.

I got all three colours and the Oxblood is my favourite.  The sparkles really stand out.  The straps are sturdy, so this may be a sandal that lasts a long time."
Bought for my dads birthday and he loved them! Says they fit perfectly! & Still in flawless shape after a couple months (Dad's a runner)
"I bought a bunch of pocket tees a long time ago to use as work shirts, they were good quality and lasted longer than I will admit to. I had been looking for a while and got an email letting me know that Dickies had a sale going on. I bought 9 new shirts and all seem to be very good quality and not super thin cheap material. I expect them to last and give good service for a few years to come."
I'm actually a size 7 but decided to get the 7.5 since my size was out of stock and I'm glad I did. The shoe fits perfect. Great shoe for work.
Cute shoe that I ordered for my 7 yr old.  The color looks great with her shorts and sun dresses.  She says they are comfortable.
"A friend of mine worked for Vanity Fair and thought I would like this style.  That was 30 years ao.  She was absolutely right!!  Periodically, I think I should try something different, so I do.  Try.  Always come back to this one.  It is well made.  It is really pretty.  It stands up to repeated washings.  It is comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time - like 16 hour work shifts - or to sleep in if you are too tired to change.  It is really a 'perfect' bra for somebody who wears a DD bra.  The support is great.  I will never, ever try another brand.  This time I mean it."
"Grand daughters love their watches, seem to be solidly made and keeps accurate time."
"LOVED, yet had to buy double-sided sticky tape. I ended up using the tape to stick the costume to my bra; otherwise it wouldn't lie flat... Also, I wore volleyball shorts under the skirt, because you can see EVERYTHING if you bend over... Still very cute, fun costume!"
Cute and warm runs a little big. Still give it 2 thumbs up
Been wearing since I opened the box  I wish they were a little bigger though
Soft and cute not to hot .
These are now one of my favorite to go casual sandals. They fit perfect for my narrow feet and looks amazing!
Pretty good quality. Will be a good keepsake for my daughter for years to come. Would buy again.
"Perfect
Does not slip and does not show
Would buy agaun"
My husband has always fit an extra large but this one seemed a hair tight in the neck and he will not wear a shirt that feels like it is choking him. Thank you.
"Love this shoe, comfortable right out of the box. Wore all day first time with no blisters. Once they break in they may be a little loose but that's what I was hoping, so I can put small arch insert in them. Great color goes with everything"
Excellent value  ... nice  colors ... soft & seem like quality ... Time will tell!
"Love this skirt! I wanted something for our Texas summers- cool enough for when the weather is hotter than hell, but still cute. It looks a lot more expensive than it is, too. As the blurb states, you will get sent a random color, which I think is kind of a cool surprise. Will definitely be ordering more."
sizing lil off
Very nice for a casual outfit. Definitely have to wear a tank top underneath.  But that was expected with all the see through geometry cuts
"Very nice and light weight.  I bought this dress to change into for my reception, it was perfect!"
My husband thinks the Gold Toe socks are always a win win.
"This is a georgus dress! The fabric, color and style are all of high quality."
"I wear these around the house and it's almost like you're bare foot but, with great support.  They are true to size and do fit like a glove.  There is no sliding or rubbing.  They have a nice sized toe box.  I'd highly recommend these Merrell Cross Trainers.  And, they're really cute too."
Very adorable. My daughter is almost 4 months old so I got the XS 0-6 month size and it fits pretty snug.  It will be okay because it's almost Halloween.
"Great light weight and ventilated walking shoe. The 15 4E fits very well and has room for and after market insert if you choose to use one. I like the Spenco brand, but the shoe is still very comfortable with the standard supplied insert. I would recommend them."
I can't say enough about how great this fits and looks! I've worn this 3 times in a month of having it! I've worn it to work and a funeral. It's a great classic that I would buy in more colors.
"Really cute shoes and perfect for!  Would be 5 stars, however one of the boots was missing the inside snap to attach when folded over.  That was a bit of a bummer, and they can't be returned or exchanged but I still like them a  lot and will definitely wear them."
Ordered these because I couldn't find any nice shirts this size locally. Kingsize never disappoints. I'm a bigger guy and these shirts always fit really well. I don't like tight fitting shirts. I like loose fitting relax shirts. Been wearing off and on the last few weeks with no issues. Seems to be well made and durable.
Just looks awesome
"Love, love them..."
"I love these lace socks, they're much sturdier than I expected, but they're not no-show in today's ballet & more open style slip-ons...you'll see them (which is a plus in my mind) around the edge of all but the most traditional of penny loafer style shoes"
Great Fit. Great underwear. Feels great.
Ordered another pair these are very comfy shoes. Got them to replace a pair of sketchers that were coming apart. I love my sketchers but these were $20 cheaper and I didn't have the extra money. I don't know if they will give me the years of service my sketchers did but I like them for now. The soles aren't as hard so I see one maybe 2 summers where as I had my sketchers about 4 or 5.
"Loved, loved, loved! This was a Christmas gift and my girlfriend loved it. It is very smooth in the inside. The texture is really nice. This looks so much better in person. Goes good with anything that you're wearing!"
"This pants fits well over the hips and thighs but the waist is a bit big and there are gaps. Still trying to find the ""ultimate no gap waist"" pants."
Comfy shoe and it came in narrow. That's all I ask!
Great 60's costume
"My girls are teens and in love with these socks! Big smiles, great fit. A winner"
"Love the fit of this dress, great for breastfeeding. Absolutely love the pockets! Softer stretchy material! Would definitely purchase a dress from them again!"
love it. love that this book bag have multiple pockets to store snacks and pencils.
"Nice workout pants for the price, I have already purchased a third pair"
"I love the style, feel and look of the shoe.  Unfortunately, they are much too big for me and will have to be returned"
These are adorable and sporty and go with so many things! My boyfriend loves them when I wear them with little shorts and some trainers they fit perfectly and arrived quickly.
Well made and a good fit
It can be annoyingly clingy but otherwise it fits well and feels nice.
"Very nice rain jacket. The fact that it's packable is a very nice touch. At 6'3, i was bit worried it wouldn't be long enough, but both the sleeves and the overall length were perfect. For the price i paid($34) it's a steal imo."
"Order a size up.  They are great shoes, but like most keen's, they tend to run small."
Reading other reviews told me that the shoe size ran small so I ordered a size bigger than I usually do. This was a mistake because they were too big. I ended up just giving them to a friend who has bigger feet than me. I suggest ignoring the reviews that say they run small and go with the size you normally wear.
Pretty - quick service from Queenberry
"Pretty shoes, but definitely run 1/2 size large."
can be a short dress or a tunic
"Great looking shirt for the price. Fits nicely, super soft cotton."
The only thing I would have liked is real shearling in them. They fit great and quality is good too.
"Own several pairs of fitflops.  Love them.  This is the first pair I own that wraps around toe.  A little uncomfortable at first.  Wasn't sure I would keep them.  Wore them in the house for several days.  Use to them now, cute shoes but not my favorite style as far as comfort."
This was a Christmas Present. She was well pleased with the panties
"Kooky, but super fun. I wear a size 14 jean and this fit great!"
nice wallet. Purchased as a gift for my dad and he really enjoys it. He is old school so he has a ton of things to put in his wallet and the wallet has been holding up well so far.
These shoes were great but unfortunately I sent them back because the rose color looked more like a muted gold tone. But the comfort and shock absorption of these shoes are amazing!
seem to grow during wear
Our daughter and husband just adopted two-year-old twins.  They came to them with very little and wanted some sparkly shoes.  They just love these shoes!  So cute and easy to use with the velcro straps.
"I'm a size 9 and ordered both the size 9 and size 10 due to the mixed reviews. The 10 ended up fitting best and I will be returning the size 9. I gave this a four star because it is comfortable, feels durable, keeps my feet dry, but it is not true to size and it'd be a huge benefit if the buckle actually allowed the calf to expand or shorten to find an appropriate fit."
Great for casual summer outings. Will order several different colors.
Gift for my 2.5 year old. He loves them
"I HATE wearing a bra 24/7, but nursing requires that I do. This bra makes it bearable. I love it! It's soft, stays in place, holds the girls up like it should, is easy to wash, and easy to nurse it. Love it! I ordered two more! Oh, and the colors are cute, too."
I love my Levi's I bought more of them and I'm going to get some more button fly 501
"not as high as they look in the picture, very very very comfortable. I bought both black and Gold and they are just perfect. This style will not go out since it is a classic. I have a normal width foot.. the front is slightly wide... but again--mostly normal width and these are perfect."
"They fit great and are a great sturdy pair of tights. Not to mention totally adorable. Only slight issue is that I'm an African American girl of color, so the nude color above the black bottoms is way to light for my skin tone. I'll still wear them anyway because their adorable. And it shipped quikly, just two weeks to get to NY."
"Super soft, good thickness, with a nice high rise to prevent crack draft. There isn't much stretch to the fleece and the cut is quite slim. I'm a 27"" waist with skinny calves, and they stay up without tying the drawstring and fit tightly from the knee down. I've been kicking around in them for three days now (leave me alone, it's the holidays) and the construction seems solid; they've been walked in, crouched in, slept in, machine-washed on cold and hung to dry, and so far there are no problems with seams or pilling. The pocket fits a Galaxy in an Otterbox case no problem. Think about sizing up if you're tall, have athletic legs, are on the upper range of your size, need to kick a man in the head from a standing position, or want them in a slightly relaxed fit like the photo."
Love these... true to size.
"I was a little concerned with the height of these shoes but b/c they are a wedge style it wasn't an issue.  The are actually quite comfortable and look great with jeans or dressed.  What can I say, they're Clarks!"
"I had to buy these, the sneaky cat looks like my goofy black cat. Too cute and so comfortable to wear."
My nephew whose turning 8 in a cple weeks loved it! And he's not going to take it off. :)
These shoes are awesome they are my second pair of Bobs. I'm looking forward to getting my next pair. Also when you buy these shoes your helping children and dogs and cats it worth it.
"well made, very pretty"
tall enough for very tall husband and fit well. I had been concerned they may have run small but they did not.
"Very well fitting Clarks shoes.
I ordered 10 medium and I am usually 9 1/2 or 10. The 10's fit me very well and I wore them ""right out of the box!"""
"The shoes fit true to size and look great...Also, the cost was lower than the department store. Great find!"
Great fit and quality the is definitely there. I bought this one and the Carhartt hat at the same time and the Carhartt is a bit thicker and a bit better material but the Dickies hat is awesome as well nothing to complain about. It's well made and looks good. I would order either one again. If you live in a colder climate (I live in Texas) then the Carhartt is a bit warmer but almost a bit too warm for our mild winters in south Texas.
"I liked this ring a lot, but I ended up returning it, because it was just too big.  I ordered a Size 8, hoping that it would fit on my index finger as a statement ring, but unfortunately, the Size 8 is too large....and it's the smallest size available.  My normal index finger ring size is a 7, so the fact that an 8 is large on me just means that it's true to size.

The ring is very comfortable to wear---I think it's because they made the interior ""comfort fit,""  i.e. domed, so it slides on and off your finger a little easier.  There's a lot of detail on this ring, including sculpted cutouts at the jaw, and heart-shaped eye sockets, which I loved.  If they made it in a smaller size, i would gladly re-order it, because it's very attractive.

---I accepted a sale price on this ring in exchange for a candid and objective review.---"
I order one of these and then two more. I looked for this necklace and everything was expensive. I wanted to give them as gifts to my daughters  They loved them.
cute & sassy
Beautiful chain..very bright and sparkly
These are very well made.  The auto open and close is super.
best flip flops
"This is now one of my son's favorite shirts. Very well made; looks great, too. He actually got compliments on it in school (and these kids rarely compliment anyone on their clothes). Extremely happy with this purchase."
"I needed a bag to carry my iPad around in with various paperwork. I decided to buy the Sketch messenger bag. Here's my take:
*durable material
*vivid bold graphic look
*adjustable strap (shoulder to across body)
*strong Velcro closure
*zipper for expandable storage area
*handles
*small zipper storage pocket on front
*great price

I can't get over how it exactly matches the hand drawn sketch in the Amazon add. It's cute and has a bold look. I love carrying it. I would recommend this bag for everyone. It's not oversized. Perfect for a tablet and some folders and such.

I purchased this bag at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
Was worried at first when it said on the bag XL (it was a size 34) but fit perfectly. The fabric is thicker than I thought but that's not a bad thing. Super fast delivery!
"Bought for friend with small wrist, I think she will love it!"
"These were too tall for me so I got a different Kamik boot.
Love Kamik rain boots. They hold up to hard use, have pretty colors and keep my feet dry.  I recommend adding insoles if you are going to be in them for long walks.  My dog likes to go 2+ miles so I add Superfeet insoles and I can be in them all day."
"Love the sneakers, but the bottoms are gray, not white as depicted. This is the 3rd time I have purchased Skechers burst sneakers with gray bottoms that appear white online. A big disappointment to me!"
cute earrings.  Gave as gift to co-worker who is great at everything!  She loved them!
"The dress is beautiful.  The fabric, lining, color  and construction are excellent - except for the fact that my measurements were not followed for a custom-made dress.  My bust size is 42"", but the dress arrived with an underarm measurement of 42"" which made it flare out at the underarm.  Fortunately, I am a seamstress and I was able to adjust the fit with underarm darts.  I am happy with the dress but I keep wondering why my measurements were misinterpreted.  I am planning to wear it for a very special occasion, and I know I will feel  attractive in it."
"Feels great and durable, and price is excellent."
Love the shirt. It's super comfortable! Would buy it again!!!!
"I like them, they are not tennis shoes with any type of support which comes with training or running shows.  They are flat, but I liked the style and the comfort.  Worth the price"
Gift for several staff.
"I got this in burgundy and expected a color darker, richer than what I received.  I expected reddish/purpleish.  Instead, I received pinkish/fuchsia-ish.

I still like it and I can make the color work for me as I have a darker complexion.  However, I'd suggest if the color is extremely important, order a few different ones and see how that look on you before returning excess ones.  I really wish the company did a better job describing the colors or taking accurate photos.

Oh, I got this exact same one (same label, made in germany, etc.) on a deal site for half off.  That's probably why I don't mind the color being not as described.  If I paid full price, I would only give this 3 stars for two shortfalls - off color and not being able to remove the label (its glued and not stitched)."
"I love these socks, mainly because they have the best non-slip bottom of any socks I've tried. These are great for a new walker on tiled floor and they're so cute. The fit is good for my 1+ year old, but I can't say whether they will still fit her at 3 yrs old."
Used for our seniors for our summer swim team photo.  They were as described.  Couldn't be happier!
I've worn Ryka running shoes for YEARS! It amazes me how the quality gets less and less but the price keeps going up and up.
"This is the most wonderful and luxurious lotion I have ever used, and I've tried quite a few. The lotion is rich and creamy with a heavenly scent that makes you feel like a queen. It does not smell overly almond-y but has a light scent that smells fresh and pretty without being overwhelming. I especially like to smooth it only my winter-chapped hands and feet. The lotion blends in easily and does not feel at all greasy or sticky. I'm going to use it sparingly so that it will last as long as possible. This would be a wonderful gift for any woman."
"Love them! Fit perfect. Not for wide feet however.
Love the purple paisley pattern!"
"there is always a gamble with straight leg when described as a ""relaxed"" cut. Should be relaxed in the hips and thighs and straight in the leg but these pants are the opposite. My friend is a seamstress that will fix the legs for free otherwise I would return and not repurchase."
"Fit as expected, and covered up my undies that you could see through my sheer wedding dress! You couldn't even tell I was wearing a slip!"
Very comfy. Slightly large. Should have gotten the 11.5. I'm a 12. And I wish it was a bit more poofy like the photo. The tongue is pretty flat on these.
I love sun dresses with pockets. This one has a hole in one of the pockets. Of course I found out the hard way. Threw it on to run to the store and lost a $20 Bill. On top of that I was embarrassed  when i went to pay ans had no money. Other than that 
"Nice quality, fits perfectly (I like how it covers my butt). I'm a size 4-6 5.3"" - ordered a size small"
"We have horse pastures kept green with pumps and a sprinkler system.  I spend a lot of time on damp ground in wet grass, and I hated days of cold, wet shoes and socks whenever the sprinklers were running.  These are comfortable, and they keep my feet warm and dry, but they don't make my feet hot.  I like the low tops rather than a regular boot because they're so easy to slip on and off.  They're a bit heavier than a pair of athletic shoes, but it's not really noticeable when you get them on.  I have a pair of Sketchers that pick up and hold pieces of gravel in the tread, but the tread on these isn't so deep that it traps gravel.  And, I like that they're made in the USA.  These are definitely a permanent wardrobe addition; I wish I'd found them years ago."
"I now own 5 pair. By far the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. Air circulation is great with no socks needed, a big plus. Two cons; not recommended for rainy surface, they become extremely slippery. They wear down rather easily. But at this price hard to resist. A little large is OK velcro makes them more stable than crocs."
"Works great, I really don't like the zipper though."
"An awesome gift I bought for my nephew will be buying others, looks exactly as described. A great buy"
Love the shoes and customer service.
These boots are so comfortable and a great material. Definitely recommend buying a pair!
I have not worn these shoes as of yet.  I did try them on.  They look great and feel great.  I expect them to be just as expected. (Great)
"Fit my son great, but shrunk quite a bit after washing, so ordered another one in a larger size (and gave the first one to his sister)."
"Cute, comfortable, returned it because I didn't NEED it, but sad to let it go!"
"Average leggings, nice print and feel but nothing fantastic.  Worth the price all in all, though I'm not sure I would buy them again."
"high quality, low price!"
"This is one of my favorites.  I am 5'1 & the medium is only a tiny bit too long - not too long though to wear doing chores and things around the house.  It's loose, great for summer.  The cut isn't too low either for modesty reasons."
Fit is great and consistent.
I love these! So comfortable. Like unbelievably. This is the second set I have bought. Awesome bright colors super vibrant and they last after tons of washes.
Beautiful match.  I replace the original shoelaces with the new ones I'm so glad I did because the other ones hurt these are much more comfortable I love them.
"My son will love these.  They are nice looking, well-made, and they look great on.  He has owned several pairs of Merrell Shoes and they have all lasted well and he tells me they are comfortable.  They are one of the nicest shoes I could find for him.  Some reviewers refer to the color as being on the green side.  I would say they are more brown than anything so don't be nervous about buying green shoes.  They are brown with orange inserts and the stitching is brown in some area and highlighted with orange thread in other areas.  Truly, the shoe is worth the price.  Very nice, in style, just a really good looking shoe.  Last time he bought a pair, several people asked him where he got them and what was the brand name !!"
"I bought these shoes for a per diem hospital job with 12 hr shifts after seeing all the great reviews from nurses. Try them! I did not like dansko's because my ankles seem to roll easily. These Saucony shoes give the clunky-supportive feel of a clog with the squishy ankle support of a sneaker. The heels especially have great support, doesn't even feel like my heel is on the ground. They are much more lightweight than I expected.

I am usually a 7 medium, but they felt too short so I returned them for 7.5 medium. These two sizes felt exactly the same in width, but the 7.5 gave me perfect wiggle room in front of my toes so I can wear thin or thick socks.

Update: After wearing these shoes for three 12hr nights in a row, I love them! My feet were not a factor at all, and usually tired/sore feet wear me down at work. Thanks for the great product."
Bought as a Christmas gift and she loves them. Perfect weight for winter sleeping.
I adore sparkle and chrome color so this just adds some bling to my polish of choice....all things better with sparkle...like glitter for nails but much much much much better....perfect as a final layer under top coat
"This shoe is pretty, and fits well, but is a wee bit short in the toe area.  Still hoping it will stretch
some in the toe box."
"Really excited that these come in fun, colorful styles!"
They look great and fit great!
These glasses fit our 5 year old and it fit an adult no problem. These glasses are inexpensive but don't look inexpensive. Would recommend 100%.
My mom loves it. Thank you.
"I bought this little purse to go with my dress for my daughter's wedding. I only put just a few necessities in it, lipstick, phone and a little pack of tissues. Since the wedding was on my brother's ranch, my purse sat in the house then I carried it down to where the reception was, from there, it sat on the table all night long. I picked it up and I then saw many loose strings and several sequins falling off. I love the purse! It was perfect for my dress. The sequins falling off a purse that didn't really get any use, I wasn't happy about."
In spite of them being just a bit small for marked size.  I use this as pant liners when it's cold out (20F or less) and under dressing in early winter and later spring.  FABULOUS!!!
fits well. Don't wear the belt too small. But I find myself doing it on all the time. Nice bright color and washes well no fading.
"SO CUTE! And I got it on sale for less than $12. Win, win!"
The top is somewhat small but my wife likes very much and I love the way they look when she walks
"These earrings and pendant arrived two days later than the delivery date.  Apparently, my package fell off the truck, because a  neighbor (from around the corner) brought the package to me.  They are beautiful, and I have decided to keep them."
"These shoes are absolutely adorable. So cute, in fact, that I have to keep wrestling them from my 4 year old grand-daughter.
They run narrow, however, and so, slightly uncomfortable for me. The front sole doesn't have as much padding/support as the heel, which was a disappointment for me. As a result of these short-comings, I can't wear them to work all day. However, for quick trips here or there, they are a great little slip-on."
"Lovely bracelet,would order again."
"This necklace is really very pretty.  I picked this up for my 13-year old daughter.  The chain is very delicate sterling silver so you really have to be careful with it.  The white Sapphires are so lovely, they sparkle like diamonds.  It really is gorgeous and she is going to love it.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is the clasp as it's hard to keep open long enough to put the necklace on.  This will make a great gift for someone special.  It comes with a velvet pouch and gift box.  I recommend."
Classy in style. I can wear it in any kind of wardrobe.
"I had to have these shoes! I was surprised because in the picture it looks black and white. When they arrived, the white is definitely more gray. Unless the screen on my laptop is horrible, the picture looks white to me. It didn't bother me any, I love them! I'm a size 8 and I feel like these might be a little snug, but I didn't want to exchange them for an 8.5 because I don't want to risk them being too big. Maybe after a couple wears they might stretch a bit.  I own other Jessica Simpson pumps in a size 8 that fit perfectly. Seriously high heel, definitely uncomfortable, but who cares? 5'-6' heels were never meant to be for comfort anyway :) They are beautiful."
"Look great, fit great. Kids love the lights!"
"Top quality, rugged, well stitched"
"I was a Zumba instructor for a year and have been taking dance and hip hop classes for a long time. It's always nice to find a shoe I like. I found these Ryka's to be more comfortable than the official Zumba shoes. I can pivot very comfortably in them. This will be great for your knees in any sort of dance cardio class because the tread is designed for pivoting, versus a straight tread for running. Highly recommend."
I purchased this as a gift.  The detail of the design was beautiful!
"I am so happy with Volcom's products lately.  These shoes are unique but not gaudy.  I wear them at work and I can wear them over the weekend.  They say something about me ... they say, ""this guy is handsome as hell."""
good buy wore them on my trip to London
"This is a good shoe to use in the gym.  It looks good, support feels good and it is comfortable.  It's hard to beat the price.  I had to give it 4 stars because it runs a little small.  The 2E I ordered is closer to a size D, but they still fit well enough.  I never had Asics before, so I'll know if there's a next time."
"I love the dress!  It is to large though. Should have ordered a 10-12 US Size .I ordered the size according to the reviews. I will keep the dress and give as a gift.  I will be ordering in a smaller size.  5'4"" 160 lbs"
"This is by far the best sports bra that I have found. The adjustable straps help ensure a custom, controlled fit. I am an advid runner and after purchasing and using this bra, I have since bough 3 more to replace most of my conventional sports bras."
He LOVES it! Super light weight. Looks awesome on his ring finger. Totally recommend this ring.
Brought this some time ago.  Maybe a year ago.  I no longer wear since it tarnished. I tried to clean it with jewelry cleaner to no avail.
very comfy fit
"Nice looking but really hard to break in, granddaughter wearing so many band aids!"
looks nice but had to get tailored to tighten around sides (under shoulders down to waist) to have more fit look.
Col shirt
I complete. Comfortable size.
Even though these run small they are very comfortable. I will never buy a different brand of flip flop. I love in central texas so a good pair of flip flops is a MUST!
I Love New Balance. One of the few shoes I have found that I can order without trying on first
"So, obviously Carhartt is known for its exceptional quality, and this shirt is no different.  However, you *must* order two sizes lower than the size of your normal shirt.  I'm 5'10, 180 lbs.  After reading the reviews I ordered a medium, when I'm normally a large.  The medium was way too big on me.  I've shrunk it as much as I can, which helped, but it's still too big.  So if you're anywhere near my size and don't want to be swimming in this shirt, you need to order a small.  I wish I did!"
these earrings are a Great price and very cute. I am very happy with them.  I have been looking for blue ones
"<div id=""video-block-R188FR6I7Z4TDA"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/E1ZWjxq3%2BpS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/911x7y-PgyS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;This is a set of 5 packing cubes.  There is a small one for your gold bars and four bigger medium ones for your clothing and etcetera.  They are designed with very sweet YKK zippers for excellent zip/unzip action, an X-design for extra reinforcement, and also contain a mesh area for air circulation so your clothes don't acquire that musty smell.  The bags are also well reinforced on the inside and the whole thing feels solid and well put together.  They are plenty roomy and built a tough non-stretchy fabric so you can flat-fold your clothes and then compress them by slightly over-packing and zipping it up which will ensure the clothes stay put and don't wrinkle.

The description doesn't mention it but each ""cube"" (its more of a box for you math people) also has a carrying handle so you could carry the pack itself for those ultra-light travel expeditions.  Finally, note that the bag is stab resistance but is not stab resistant.  So don't wrap it around your body and use it as armor when visiting shady places in foreign lands."
the product is actually really loved it. arrived at the right time and not had any problems. I recommend to everyone.
"This is a nice suit with good material and is well made but is a teensy too small.  Both the bottom and top fit tight but I will keep the suit anyway hoping that either it stretches some or I lose a couple of pounds.  This is an XL and they don't sell a XXL so I can't size up, bummer!  Gail"
It`s great.
Came perfect
"I have one huge issue with these socks, they are not full length dress socks.  They don't even go up to my calves.  I was not expecting this when I ordered them so it was quite a shock when I unravelled the first pair.  However, I will say that these socks do fit nice and they seem to be pretty good quality.  I have purchased other dress socks recently and they were the cheap, very thin socks that have virtually no stretch to them.  These socks are WAY better than those.  It they were a bit longer I would have given them 5 stars, but they are too short and it is really hard to tell from the pictures."
"These sandals are absolutely awesome, do however by a half size larger as they run somewhat small"
"Tyrion Lannister! His face is so beautiful on this shirt I love it. You can clearly see who it is from a distance, and I get complimented on it all the time. Fits perfectly with a little extra room, and the shirt is so soft. One of my favorite shirts I own!"
"Beautiful pendant. Got it for my daughter so she can always have some of her beloved Husky with her. She loved it, and so so I."
"This is a very high quality, well made sweater. It looks so adorable with a little polo shirt and knee socks; like something Princess Kate might dress George in. I love it! I find a lot of kids clothes seem to come with loose buttons that need reinforcing before they ever even get worn, but the stitching is impeccable on this sweater and the buttons are crafted to last."
"I had been looking for a cloth type shoulder bag for some time.  Having a bad back, I need to carry as little weight as possible but big enough to carry necessary needs.  Seems durable as it is lined in denim material.  My only complaint is that the zipper does not connect end to end; it is about an inch in on each side.  Otherwise, I really do like it."
"The waist may be fitted or slightly snug upon wearing the first time. Wait an hour, and you'll wish you were wearing a belt to keep them up. There is room in the legs for those with larger calves because of the stretch. They will seem fitted, but if you don't mind this, they stretch as much as you'd need to move. I'm impressed with the stretch factor in the legs, but not to happy about the waist. Good pair of jeans. Keep in mind these are straight leg, not tapered at the ankle and not wider trouser leg jeans."
"Easy dress to wear- wore all summer long from birthday parties to the beach.  I received so many compliments on this dress.  I would buy again.  The black is very slimming-more so that the other colors that these dresses come in, like the blue."
They're light. The straps sometimes curl and have to be uncurled. Better support than other flip flops...and they keep my feet cleaner/away from the ground.
Great for working in houses so I don't have to wear boot covers. Fashionable too.
"Love them!  Light weight and they don't irritate my daughter, who is very picky!  I use them under her dresses."
very cute normal t-shirt material.
Love this bar necklace.  Hangs exactly where I want it.  works well with t-shirts and almost any top.  Very stylish.
Everything I expected it to be and more. This clutch is exactly how it is advertised. Love my purchase.
I love this pump. It is my go to classic pump; however just wore it with jeans and it looked so stylish.  Great buy.
Super cute! Fits perfect
"The ""open suitcase"" picture with the product information leads you to believe that these are larger than they are.  I'll admit, I was a bit underwhelmed when I first got these out of the package. They're small and look flimsy.

But, they do hold a lot of items.  And they are handy for travel.

When full, the larger bag is about 14"" x 11""x 3"".  I can easily fit about 6-8 women's med/large t-shirts inside if I fold them carefully.  The smaller bag is about 11"" x 8"" x 3"" and comfortably holds a dozen pairs of underwear and a couple of bras.  On trips where we live out of our suitcase it'll be helpful to have items separate.

They're great for packing items that go together for an overnight stay. Keep pajamas, light robe, and slippers separate from other clothing in a duffel or carryon.  They'll be ideal for packing my children's clothing separate from mine when we share a suitcase on short trips.

They'll also be useful for storage for off-season  or holiday clothing or fabric items that can be folded and put away.

The product information says they're ""water-resistant"" and that might be true. However, the sizable mesh panel on the front of each case will let moisture in so don't count on these to be waterproof.  I wouldn't use these for toiletries for the same reason. If something leaked inside the bag, it would also leak out of the bag."
fast delivery & good prices definitely recommend you try them
"I am very selective when it comes to bras. This is one of the most flattering & supportive bras I've had. I'm bigger chested & it's hard to find a strapless bra that's comfortable, yet can also be worn with the straps--either the regular ones or seethrough ones--5 different ways. If you have any doubts I highly recommend it..."
"This swim top is adorable. I ordered size small and size medium.  The small fit through the rib cage, but the cup size was too small for me. I tried the medium and the cup size was good, but it was too loose around the rib cage.  I am guessing the small is about a 32B/C and the medium is about a 34 C/D. I wanted to wear it with the straps, but I didn't like the placement in the front.  They were too far to the side which was very uncomfortable. I was going to keep the medium and shorten the straps around the rib cage and move the other straps closer to the center, but unfortunately the bikini bottoms did not fit right either.  The top band was very thin and cut into my waist so it was not flattering. I am 5 foot 5 inches and weigh 133 pounds.  It's hard to rate if the top runs large or small, since there are so many bra sizes."
I love this watch. The gold is more rose-tinted in person. Band is soft but strong.
This raincoat is adorable and fit my daughter as expected. It holds up to rain and isn't too bulky in a car seat. The hood stays on well. Definitely a smart purchase.
My daughter loves it and she is 12 years old.
"Material is thin, but its so very comfortable and cozy, I love mine!"
Great transaction and great product.
"They are amazing but a bit small for a 7.5 still very nice for an affordable price,"
It fits well and is well made. I like the color and the leather is of good quality. The holes are a little small but it does fit well. I have purchases these before.
Stretched and can wear it now.
We just ordered this for our daughters cinco De mayo birthday party and it arrived earlier then expected and fits her perfect! 
"Ample size for 2-T. Gave a bit of extra growing room, and the length was very good."
What a great jacket! Fits perfect. Looks elegant. Very veritile. Strongly recommend.
Love it!  So pretty!  Do you also have it in purple to dark purple?
several years with this bag and it is holding up great!  Daily use.
"Nice Necklace, daughter loves it. Quite Happy."
"Total package. Very comfortable and soft, nice for relaxing after a hard days work before going to bed. I would recommend this because it is worth for the price"
I have several of those different colors! I love them! Best thing I ever bought!
"This is a really great suitcase and it looks good too. If you are interested in it I'd say get it, but know that it is large for a 28"" suitcase. It is an 1"" or 2 thicker and wider than a lot of 28"" suitcases. That may be good for you - I wish this came in 26"" as there is already a 30 and a 20"". It scratches some but I don't really care that much, its a suitcase - and the scratching is not crazy. There is no zipper compartment in the inside which seems like an oversite to me, but on the whole, this is a really nice and sturdy piece of luggage."
My wife love this shirt. Seems to run a little small. Well made and material is soft.
"Colorful, versital and comfortable."
"First, these are super cute and pretty comfortable except for a couple items.  There is a tag sewed in on the inside bottom that is kind of uncomfortable.  You get a little used to it though but it is kind of scratchy.  The sole is flexible yet stiff so walking outside is okay although they are slippers so I wouldn't go to the store or something in them and they do seem to run a tiny bit small.  I wear a size 6 and my toes are right at the tip.  Not squeezed just right at the end so I guess if you wear the EXACT size, they work.  If you are a tiny bit larger they might not work unless you went a whole size larger.  Totally adorable and for the most part pretty comfortable.  Note, the bottom is not very thick and they are very flat so there is no arch support or anything."
"I like this style of scrub pants.  The elastic waist band isn't too tight.
And, there are lots of pockets which is very handy!"
Love the floral navy blue band and the light up dial. Watch is easy to read with all the numbers on the face. Will consider purchasing another in a different color.
"Heaven, I am Heaven ... or at least my feet are.  I Only buy these and only these flip flops as they are soooooo comfortable. Super cushiony and has arch support - unheard of in any other brand - and believe me - I have tried a great many other brands. I wear them every single day, no matter how much I have to walk and never have any problems with my feet hurting.  The colors are exactly as pictured. They do run about a size small but since I know that ahead and order accordingly, that fit fine ( I normally wear a wide but no need with these)"
They were a very good price. I hope you will advertise more of that style. My son finds them to be very comfortable
"I bought this shirt for an in-law's wedding. It fit nicely, was a good material, and looked good. I would have paid much more for a similar shirt in the mall. Highly recommend. I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a fair, honest and unbiased review. I only buy products that I will actually use and test to give fair feedback on. I also only give a 5 star rating when the product is excellent and deserves such a rating. I base my review on overall quality, use, and if it meets the description given by the seller. If I feel that I can't honestly give at least a 4 or 5 star rating then I contact the seller and try to resolve the problem first to see if there is anything than can be done that would remedy the situation. Sometimes there are only so many things you can say about a product, so I try to be as direct as possible. You can trust that my reviews are not only for the sellers benefit but for other customers interested in purchasing this product as well."
My godchild loved this and it had wonderful spinning motion!
I've seen 4 other players wearing this shoe in the fall season so it's a popular look. Hope it holds up....It's bright and classic. Tired of the over-the-top neon look
"Definitely my favorite hat, great colors of green in this hat. a lot of compliments on this hat."
"I really loved these, especially for the price I paid for them. They go with everything I wear, and because there ate quite a few, I can stand to misplace a few and still have plenty to pick from."
"The smallest size fits perfectly my 5 year old son. The material os good and comfortable. The legs are a lot longer than others I had purchased before, like CK, but my son likes it even better."
"I got these for my wife. She's a nurse who is on her feet for 12-14 hours per shift.

The asics provide great support and comfort.

Service was quick and shoes were in mint shape.

Would recommend to all."
"This is so sweet! I love mine! I got mine free for doing a review and feel very lucky to have got one! First off, I have been keeping my delicate necklaces in baggies to keep them from tangling. That makes it hard to know what I have and even harder for accessorizing my outfits! Plus its just ugly to keep your pretty things in baggies. I LOVE trees, anything to do with nature, and this tree has some really pretty etching on the trunk and in the tray which I feel are details that could easily be overlook and I love them. It is easy to put together, sturdy, the metal is not thin at all. I love the birdies on it too! Now my delicate jewelry looks pretty being displayed as it should be and makes getting ready in the morning super fast and easy. Check out my photos!
Don't know what else to say but get one for yourself or anyone you love that likes their pretties! I keep rings and also a perfume bottle that does not stand up in my tray. I think all girls, women, regardless of age will love this pretty timeless piece. A great holiday gift!"
This product is awesome to work out in
Love this for a casual summer day!!!!
I liked them a lot but they were a half size too small
"I bought this to hold the ladies in because I'm starting my fitness journey. I've been running and doing cardio in this bra, works great at holding the ladies and I'm a 36dd"
Compact and lightweight. Really helps to keep luggage organized when on lenghty trips.
Very pretty bracelet. I'm glad I finally bought one.
"I really like these earrings and they are pretty much exactly what I expected! The different size variations are just perfect for any occasion and the earrings look very convincing. My only complaint is that the spring broke on the smallest pair after just a few wears, but overall I love these clips! No one will ever know that they are clip ons. Love em"
My son is tall and thin. I ordered an irregular size and I was concerned that they would be too big when I took them out of the package but they ended up being only slightly baggies than I wanted. We kept them and I know in a few washes they will be perfect.
"Okay, when I firts put these on I thought I had messed up. They seemed way to tight, but after a few hours they loosened up and are awsome. The inside is fully lined with the shearling which is very bulky until you compact it down a bit. They fit perfectly now. I have had them about a week, it only took a couple hours of wearing and I realized they were slowly fitting themselves to the contour of my feet. Very nice, I recommend them highly."
This is absolutely adorable on my son! He thinks the map silk fabric on the inside is cool too! L
"my only complaint is that the sole is a little thin (however all the kenneth cole flats I have are the same), but the color is soooo pretty, I don't care. they were also 20 bucks! cant' beat that."
"Small fit, no stretch but very pretty fabric"
"The calf is slightly wider than what I would think would be most flattering, but the shoe part is wonderful.  My shoe size is 9.5 W."
These are warmer than typical tights. Perfect for layering in cold weather.
Great long lasting tee's
Fit well I love them
Love the necklace.  Good quality and well made.
"Fits well, material nice and colors pretty"
Great shirt fit great and the colors are bright and vibrant just as pictured and a great price :)
"The leather is super soft, they are so comfortable, i wear it all day, even for work, and i'm happy feet!  i love them"
Beauftiful colour. Classy design which can be worn in many ways. Nice ration quality vs. price.
love these t shirts and always available on Amazon when I want em & in my choice of colors
Very comfortable. Fits well
I liked my first pair of Muk Luks. Wish they had a better quality but overall I'm satisfied.
I got this for my Dad for father's day and he loved it. It is very soft and the RFID makes it safe. It was the perfect gift for him.
"Love these! They are silky and feel so cozy on. They are a bit loose, not skin tight, but I like that. I don't feel constricted or stuffed in them. The front is high waisted, but also loose which makes me feel great! Not more elastic marks on my sides. I'm 185lbs 5' 10"" and they go below my ankle in an XL. I have a bottom that goes out and wide thighs with small calves.  The pattern is really cute, but in reality the red, black, pink and white show up the most though you could probably get away with moss green or soft turquoise. In the photo the purple looks dominant, but its very little.  They are very artsy with sketches and drawings highlighted by all sorts of airbrushed looking colors.  I'm so happy with these I want to see if they have other colors or patterns."
"OK so 1 it is Asian sizes.. I bought for my 2 year old daughter so they seem to fit better for her then they would a boy they did shrink after i dried them and by shrink i mean they are now shorter not really a difference in width.

Order a larger size don't dry and the price isn't bad 3 shirts with character which are technically owned by Disney now... I'm happy with my purchase just know they do run small my daughter is in between a 24 month and a 2t and I ordered a size shirts say tall m and are 100% cotton.. after fluffing the captain it stated close to actual size and the Spiderman and Hulk dried on med heat and are both shrunk different"
"I purchased them to be dyed to the color of my Mother of the Bride dress.  I was excited to receive them because the style is so pretty and just what I wanted, peep toe and mid size heel.  Sadly I had to return them because they run small.  I held them against my size 9 shoes and they were at least a size smaller. I could have returned them for a larger size I didn't want to take the chance that they weren't right either."
My mom loves this shoe
"So far so good, would have liked more info on the box about the product characteristics."
Great glasses. Bought two more pair.
Very similar to Rockports.
"I ordered this ring after researching it locally. There is a brand name jeweler selling this identical ring for upwards of 300.00 depending on size. Theirs to uses Nickel binding. Given I have a 13.5 ring finger the price for mine would have approached the 300.00 dollar mark. The reviews looked promising and after some research to bring me up to speed about this type of ring I ordered a 13.5 sized ring. The ring arrived in fine condition and was actually a perfect fit so I would say size runs true in this ring. The comfort fit feature is excellent too. The shine is terrific and I would say it actually appears to be slightly darker than the site picture, which to me adds a nice touch. Since it is made from Tungsten do expect a heavy ring. While nickel, the binding agent in this ring,  may be an irritant, tungsten and nickel alloys are actually hypoallergenic. This is because in the process of combining both metals, the nickel binds so well with tungsten that it loses its ability to react with the skin. On the other hand...Cobalt alloys, are a common irritant and may trigger rashes. Aside from causing a skin reaction, cobalt-based tungsten rings will appear to have spots and stains over time in areas where the metal came into contact with the skin. Oxidation occurs when cobalt bonds with oils in the skin. This makes the metal appear similar to tarnished silver.  This ring offers similar durability compared to gold and silver. Tungsten carbide rings also have low-maintenance requirements and don't need regular polishing since the original polish can last a lifetime.  A Tungsten ring to me of this quality and at this outstanding price makes a great choice to me. Recommended."
"I wear these shoes everyday to work and they are comfortable for standing all day. However, they are not the best for walking as your foot will slide around quite a bit. Easy to slip on and the color is as pictured. I did order a size smaller than I normally wear and they fit well."
"These are a really good idea, I got them for my pre-teen and teen since they always seem to destroy shoestrings 5 minutes after wearing their shoes... I gave these 4 starts because they do exactly what they are supposed to, but, my son still managed to destroy them in less than a week. I was so much hoping these would be more durable since they don't untie so they're not dragging the ground like his other laces. I would still recommend these though! especially for someone who doesn't annihilate shoe laces by just looking at them as my children do..."
Nice collar stays! All of the shirts my boss wears use this particular size collar stay - it was surprisingly hard to find a full case of them instead of the variety packs. He's a happy camper now!
"My daughter was not able to demolish those shoes, they are very nice, very comfortable and very solid"
I love this tunic! I wore it the day after it arrived! Looks super cute with leggings!
this is very cute but just not my style so i returned
"Its nice. at the sides its a little bit big for me. I think someone with nice waist , this would fit perfectly.
Other than that. good fabric also."
"Excellent on body watch to calculate steps, and sleep cycle. Much easier than walking with an iPhone always."
"I have been looking for  simple but attractive band for a long time.  I'm wearing this ring on my thumb and it looks great. It compliments my wedding ring. I am so pleased with it.  Arrived on time, packed well and in perfect condition.  Highly recommended."
Enjoyed this the whole summer.
Great hat!  But it does run small.  My 9 month old wore it as part of his Halloween costume and it was a perfect fit.  I don't think we will get more than one season out of it.
"Like the watch but it was a little larger then I would have prefered.
Easy to set up and use."
"Love rayon caftans for  the comfort factor, and the washability.  Great for summer wear when the weather is humid.  I wear rayon as often as cotton,
and find both very comfortable.  Well made for the price.

Very well made, and a good quality caftan.  It is very long, and I am going to cut and hem it to avoid tripping.  Other than that, I am happy with the purchase."
This necklace was perfect. Loved it.
"My hair is dry and damaged, I've tried tons of conditioners.  Either they don't really penetrate or they make my hair heavy and greasy!  I wondered if this stuff would work and it does.  Immediately the first day of use it made my hair silky, smooth and shiny again. I could not believe it!  Like normal, healthy hair.  I have been using if for the past 5 days and it still keeps it looking and feeling soft.  But I have noticed by the third day that it wasn't as a dramatic/effective result as the first day.  So maybe use 2-3 times a week instead of everyday?  But still better than ANYTHING I have use before.  You press the button on the top and it comes out in a foam that you work from your roots to the ends.  If you have long hair you might be going through this product fast.  The only thing that is a bit negative is that it is pricey.  But for the results I will be purchasing more."
Seems just like LuLaRoe leggings to me.  Why pay more?
"The item arrived with the large knob brocken - the thing still works, and I am now able to locally stretch my walking shoes to eliminate those areas where the footbox doesn't quite fit my feet.  I was getting corns on the my wee wee wee all the way home and the toe that has no roast beef (I have no idea if I got the right piggies there).  now I am able to wear the shoes without pinching/binding or pain...  love the thing."
"I have bought 4 packages of this bikinis, for my daughters and now for a niece.  They come in beautiful colors and they love them. True size."
"These are slippers, so arch support isn't expected. I typically wear a size 6-61/2, and have extrememly narrow feet. I ordered these in a size 8 eight so I could wear them over a bandage on my foot and they barely fit my unbandaged foot. They ar very cute and comfy and warm, just buy them big!"
"this looks so much more expensive than what it really cost.
It's big somewhat heavy. Looks classy just shine it with some windex in the glass part and boom it will look like a $200 box!"
"Fit great and wear a long time at work, don't need new ones very often"
"I love it , and very ncie"
Purchased for my 9 year old grandson.  He likes them because they are Timberlands and are very comfortable.
"Very soft, very cute.  Love the magnetic closure.  We will have to grow into this one.  It is large on my 10 month old (26 lbs, 30"" tall).  I ordered the 18-24 month because my baby wears 18 month clothes (in Carter)."
"So, I just received this package in the mail it came when expected and there was minimal damage to both sides of the box, however, the shoes were in no way affected by this.

I ordered the black boots, I really wanted the brown but they were out of stock in my size. Anyway, I think I like the black a lot more than I thought I would. The material is very smooth and leather like, the color is great! Will look amazing with some jeans and a tank top or a matching black leather jacket. They are great, the heel is not too tall if you are not comfortable with big heels. They are also very sturdy. I say that because once, I bought a pair of boots with heels, mind you they had thick heels not those skinny heels, and it just broke! Completly came off! So to me, the heel is pretty sturdy and won't do THAT. Also, these boots do have a zipper.

Now I don't know about other ladies, but for me, depending on the shoe and brand, I can be a 7, a 7 1/2, 8 or an 8 1/2. Weird, right? But anyway, I mostly wear an 8 1/2 in heels and boots so I ordered an 8 1/2 and it was a bit big. The good thing about that is that I can fit some skinny jeans into the boot if I want. Maybe if I wear some thicker socks it won't be so bad. I'm still debating if I should return and order an 8, but I worry that those could be too small for me.

Aside from that, the boots are great and they look amazing! Better AND cheaper than larger known brands and those I've seen in stores.

I received this product at a discount rate in exchange for my honest yet unbiased review."
"Very cute, warm, extremely unique looking scarf.  Bought them in MANY colors this past winter and wore them all the time.  Very nice to have something like this -- unique and different than all the other scarves out there.  None of mine had ANY strange odor at all.  Very soft and comfy to wear.  Drapes nicely.  Adds warmth in the cold AND a pop of color to an outfit.  Definitely a fall/winter scarf only.  Love them!!!!"
love the coverage and style of these glasses.
"This was a Christmas gift and came bagged up on a hanger really nice. The quality is really good for the suit look. It is too small and so had to return it. Bought it on a lightning deal so lost money on the shipping and ""deal"" sale amount. But all in all it was a smooth return transaction. Would have loved for it to have fit well."
Very nice cardigan. It fit perfect and looked very nice on.
I had problems with my feet hurting from standing on concrete floors all day at work. These shoes too care of that problem. Highly Recommended.
Its good ... cozy and warm
"This is my 3rd Alex and Ani bracelet and I love them!  I love that this one is swords from the archangels. The other two I have have held up well and still look great.  I am so pleased with this product, I hope to have more soon!"
"I really like this but the lace makes it a little more constrictive.  Still very comfy & supportive.  Pretty, too."
"Excellent replacement for canvas on leather straps.  These feel soft and supple and wash easily.  They are a good value and I recommend them.  At this time, I don't know how long they will last when compared to the more expensive canvas on leather."
Real comfy.
I liket. I lovet!!!
"These fit well and have a bit more room in the knee area than the Nova which I also have .  Both fit well, but if you're sitting often throughout the day, the Nova Solver is more comfortable . overall great jeans from Volcom"
I love it . Well made nice colors .
the gift was a great gift she loved it
"I bought this same style on another website in white.  I like that one a lot, however, this beige bra is so comfortable it is easy to forget I am wearing it.  It has back support too.  And a really nice silhouette under tops.  A very good purchase.  Buy your regular size."
"Exactly as pictured and described.  It works great for sun protection during summer bicycle commuting.

I actually bought a variety of balaclavas including this one priced from less than $4 to $13.  Except for the different colors, they are virtually indistinguishable.  They're all good and this one in the middle of the price range is just fine.  I was thinking that I would return the dissatisfactory units, but I'll just keep them all and wear a nice fresh one every day."
I LIVE IN THESE THINGS.
I wore it everyday and more comfortable
"I wanted new oxfords and wanted something fun. These shoes fit the bill. Like many of the shoes being made today they are synthetic leather...but in color like this--who cares. the only problem..if you call it that...is that they are so bright I have to be careful what outfits I pair them with unless I want to look clownlike. So  I keep it simple in blacks and other neutrals and I can get my pop of fun. And considering that they only cost $20..its okay to wear them every now and then.
I also bought  them in  blue ..which is really a periwinkle. The intensity of color in blue is more subdued and these can go with more outfits."
I really did think I was not going to like this item so much because I am a little heavy and that it would not look right but I love this dress I want to wear it all the time.  It actually looks better then I thought it would.
Always love PattyBoutik clothes
"Adorable designs, comfortable and have just enough absorbancy to be great training pants...I would definitely purchase again and recommend to others."
"I MUST have shoes with a good arch support.  That's not a huge problem with casual shoes and athletic shoes, but it is extremely difficult to find dress heels with a good arch support.

Even though I don't wear heels very often, if I am in any shoe with a good arch support, my knees are not very happy.  I was thrilled to find nice-looking heels with arch support.

These are a classic, never-go-out-of-style kind of shoe.  I've gotten compliments on them every time I've worn them.  My feet and knees like them, too."
"These little stickies are inexpensive, so I cannot rate them too horribly. They stick and stay pretty well, but the first time I took them off they left adhesive stuck to my body. They will stick again, but I am not sure how many uses I can get out of 1 set. Also, a little small for larger breasted people. But, they did work great for the backless dress I bought."
They look nice and hope that it is as comfortable as it seems to be.
"So in love! It's beautiful, true to size, and excellent material."
"My husband just orders this shoe (whatever version is available) about every 6 months or so, as his old ones wear out. He is in them 4-5 days per week, all day."
So cute and goes with so many outfits
Love them!  Get many compliments:)
"It's a little small, but it still fit and I am a somewhat bigger woman at 5'8"" and 180 pounds. The white button looked a little cheap, could have done without.  Otherwise I like the style."
Kept me warm in Iceland so I'd recommend to anybody... Darn Tough is the way to go.
My grandson loved it. It was really cute. Nice quality and true to size. It was delivered on time.
"I love this cardigan!!! So soft, washed up in the washer just fine, hung dry.  I went by the size chart and it fits per size not conventional S, M, L sizes.  I normally wear an XL top which measures about 42-45 inches in the bust so that's what I looked for.  Hangs below the crotch area.  Wonderful cardigan!"
Bought this for my granddaughter's 5th birthday.  She just loves all the Dollie and Me outfits.  Great value for these
very comfortable... go-to work shoe
Larger heel make is very comfortable.
It's so cute on him. Love the suspenders
LUV IT !! So Cute. So Convenient!!  Can Carry MANY cards !!
Favorite type of hushpuppies Light as a feather
"High quality, but on the small size...more toddler size than little kid but my son wanted it as his school umbrella and he is very happy with it"
Nice looking and easy to read.
"I weigh 110lbs and have a 34B chest.  I have to wear a tank underneath to cover my bra on the sides and from the side the tummy area is huge, plenty to hide a huge belly pouch. The material is nice and it's very pretty so i can make it work."
"Great product.  Looks beautiful, and has adjustable clamps that you can remove yourself.  Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it."
"I anticipated  it running small, and because of the cut you can do this, I ordered a large. I'm 5.6, 130 lbs, 35-28-36. You'll need to wear a slip as it's a bit thin ( the material) I get a lot of compliments on this dress."
This costume is adorable! I ordered my size and it fit perfectly. The only problem I had was in the chest area. It was hard keeping it covered so I pinned the back to help hold it. It is worth every penny.
Fit a little smaller then expected. Still love these rings seem to be holding up to every day wear.
"I received these boots yesterday and walked around in them most of the evening (I'm silly like that). The seem to fit a bit small in the width. They fit fine- true to size with thin socks on but I don't think they would have been super comfortable if I'd have put on thicker ones. The are certainly waterproof and a nice solid construction. My only issue so far is where it sits on the calf area seems like it's going to chafe a bit. (the calf is a good loose fit like I expected from a rain boot) However,  the collar rubs on front of my shin and back of my calf when walking. I just rolled the collar down and it felt a lot better. If you wear tall socks then you'd never even notice the mild chaffing. I'd certainly purchase again..."
"I love a soft shoe and this shoe is one of the softest. It's like running on pillows, which I love. I haven't had them long, but I worry about how long they'll last. All that cushion... just seems like they'll wear out sooner than other cushion shoes. So far, so good though.

I run around 10-12 miles a week, 3-5 times a week."
We saw these sparkly shoes at Nordstrom and loved them. Unfortunately they didn't have my daughters size. Luckily Amazon did so we ordered right away! I loved the simplicity of these shoes and my daughter loved how they sparkled. She wore them all over Disneyland and never complained of any discomfort. I thought they were so cute and even looked great with princess dresses.
"I just got this today and I must say im blown away by the quality and beauty of this tie. After reading some reviews about the color being off a little, I was afraid I had made a mistake. After opening the package all my fears where laid to rest. This is easily one of the best ties i own now..I would definitely recommend this product. I will be making more purchases of this brand."
"Good shoe, comfortable, would order again."
Just what I was looking for to layer under sleeveless and short sleeve dresses. I ordered a size up and it fit perfectly. Had to order another one right away.
"Nice wallet, but it was really tight out of the box. After putting 3 or 4 cards in, it was very difficult to get them back out because it was so tight. I needed to stretch it out so it would be more usable, so I stuffed it with as many old cards I could possibly fit (probably about 8 or 10 total) plus some folded up bills on the side. I had to really hammer the last couple cards in. I left it like that for 2 weeks to stretch out. I had so many cards in there, I actually had to use pliers to get them back out, but after that the wallet was usable! It stretched the leather just enough so that I can fit some cards in there without them being impossible to remove. Works as a nice slim wallet for times you only need to carry a few cards."
Great price on great sunglasses. I purchased 3 pair.
"a little on the small side, not a lot.
100% cotton but a rough weave. I hope it softens after washing."
Great swimsuit! So slimming!
"I just received this tank in the mail today and I was so excited to try it on the material seems very well made and it is absolutely adorable!! But here is my issue... It was way too small I ordered a medium because I'm usually in between a 4 or a 6 (more so a 4) so I figured that would work it was so tight I was almost afraid I wouldn't get it off lol! But that was not the fault of the company it was my judgment of picking a size. So it will just be a gift to one of my sisters and I know they will love it! Just make sure if your an in between size to go a size up! I did purchase this item at a discounted price to give my honest review.

I gave this to my sister and she absolutely loves it and it looks so adorable on her!! Yes this is a great product just make sure you order a larger size than you usually would!"
These are so pretty! I got the aqua. They fit great! I wear a women's size 7 shoe. I have very muscular legs and I'm so glad these are stretchy enough to to fit my 15 inch calves. They can be worn bellow the knee or pulled up over the knee but then they feel a little tight. I will definitely get more colors!
"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

I am super impressed with this dress. If you look at the back, there is a zipper on the bottom part and several clasps on the top strap that goes across your back. It is very well made! It is juniors sizes, so order up one size. You could wear a bra with it but the material is pretty stuck on the top so you might not need to. It is pretty short, so I might end up wearing leggings with it but I am 5'9"" and 150 lbs, I ordered a large and it fits me well. This is made for girls who don't have a very large chest so if you are more endowed, you might have some issues with the top portion."
Fit as expected pleased with the fit and the value.
Very comfy. Very cute. I can wear them out and at work. Everyoe loved these shoes. Great buy! I recommend.
Bought a pair for my husband and I and we both love them!!
"I got it for my little one's first Thanksgiving and it was just perfect!  Just be aware it does run small, because it fit my 9 month old perfectly, but he is pretty tiny (just over 14 lbs)"
"Really like the style and the company that sent it, DJs Boardshop, sent it VERY quickly... loses one star because they run a little small so order 1/2 size larger and they are perfect!"
I ordered them to match our dress for the USTA tournaments and I love them. My team and my coach love them too and couple of them already have ordered the same shoes. They fit perfect and provide perfect support.
"Just got two of these (two different colors). Haven't tried them yet (will update the review and the rating if needed after  I do), but wanted to mention that it's 55% cotton/45% polyester (it says it on the back of the bag as well as on the back side of the shirt's tag), and not 60%/40% as the description here states. It does feel nice to a touch, I just hope more polyester and less cotton won't interfere with how comfortable it will feel once on."
"Very comfortable pants, stays up without being too tight or pinching. Great pants to wear when you do a lot of bending and walking. Easy care too! Great purchase."
great for casual week end wear  material  wise nice.
only those who are in th know can chuckle at this...
This is a gorgeous watch!  One can wear it with full confidence that is is appropriate for the occasion.  Beautiful!
"Love these shoes, they are super cute and fit my feet great. I am generally a size 6 in shoes and ordered that size, they fit fine. They are a BIT big in the toe but not enough to be uncomfortable or cause any sliding. They also are a great width for me, though I do have narrow feet. I think if I had sized down they would have been too narrow. They are extremely comfortable."
Love these socks!  I get to put a little awesome in my work attire with these.
"A patriotic watch band which fits my ""Timex"" watch, and is among the many colors and straps."
Love it !! It is light weight and very warm ideal for a winter vacation.
"I've had this watch for a couple of years now and I still love it.  It matches with everything and I'm constantly getting compliments on it because it is so unique.  I didn't buy from this seller, so I'm not sure about sizes... I would try to find a store that carries it so you can try it on in person because for me it fits perfectly."
Perfect for me and my husband
"Once they stretched a little, they fit well. The detail on toe is very cute. Love these shoes."
"I really love this velour jogging suit. It is waaaaaaay more stylish than others. It doesn't have an ""old lady"" look to it at all. It fits perfectly and makes my petite figure look cute. I would definitely purchase again. I got the gray color and it is very flattering. FYI, I am 5' 1"" and weigh 98 pounds and bought size small. All I had to do was hem the pants, which I did by hand, not on a sewing machine. The material is such that you can't tell they're hemmed (no puckering) so I am very happy about that too.

Now, I haven't tried washing it yet. Just to be safe, I will probably wash on gentle and hang dry..."
"Ive had one for years. Reliable as heck. Great in a wide range of temps. Im considering a sherpa-lined one to go even colder. Cant find them in town so Im coming to Amazon. Aint it the dangdest thing how department stores always carry stuff youll need *next* season instead of the stuff you need *right now*?

(FWIW got one of their jackets, too; and seatcovers for our car. A-1!)"
"For people who want a bigger bag, with lots of space. This bag is big enough to hold two full size handguns (definitely could hold more) and a ton of ammo. Sturdy zippers and stitching."
"Excellent runner folks ... very pleased with this purchase. ""true to fit"", lots of room in toebox, required minimal ""breaking in"". Gonna hate to hang these up. Would certainly purchase again!"
I like the leggings nice and soft fits the same after every wash..but of course I am short 5'3 and I am curvy..I can wear them in the summer and winter
My husband is 6'2 and it comes down to below his knees. It's very soft and thick. Only thing it shed a bit in the beginning.
"This shoe is wonderful as a very cushy shoe. It is almost like walking on clouds as they are very lightweight. Due to their soft nature, they do not provide the kind of support a good cross-trainer shoe would, but I give them 5-stars for being a great easy-on, easy-off, cushy shoe for tired feet. You will want to try them for yourself. At least one pair of this type of shoe should be in every women's shoe collection."
"Kid has an arch support but have purchased two pairs of these, very comfortable and have lasted a full school year."
This is a classy yet sexy piece. This is a piece that can be worn with a variety of bikini bottoms. It gives good support if you have a larger chest. The middle section is a bit loose. I am wearing it with my Tommy Bahama pink and black stripe bikini bottom for my Hawaii trip. It looks cute. It is a bit pricey for a tankini top but work the price.
"the cotton is thiner than the last one i bought,  tehe size is ok"
Nice very attractive
Perfect for astronaut Halloween costume.
"perfect ones! lightly padded, m/c washable."
Love these shoes!  Super comfortable!
"Pretty, kinda cheaply made but you get what you pay for. It hangs from my rear view mirror because I find that the stretchy string the beads are on pinches my arm after a while."
Present for my mom hope she likes them
"I have a hard time finding cute short sleeve shirts that are good for nursing and are comfortable. This one fits the bill. It's super soft, has a nice fit, and can be unbuttoned easily for my ravenous little one."
"Not much to say but it is well made from quality fabric, fits well and feels good to wear. Before washing length and sleeves were a bit long but after that perfect."
Really nice flat shoes.
Light and wonderful!~  I want to get another pair!  I instruct fitness classes and these are perfect!
"Very comfortable pants.  I bought this product in a size 36"" waist and I'm actually a 37"".  The stretch covered the extra inch just fine."
Fits great nice and comfortable.
"Very comfortable, takes impact stress off heels, knees, and lower back. Snug fit helps keep the shoe on your foot while moving instead of flopping around under you.

I purchased these shoes to coalesce casual and active ware into one pair of shoes. They have good traction on a variety of surfaces, however on linoleum I noticed that the side to side traction gave just a little however forward back traction was still very good.

Overall the build seems good. While I have only been using them for a couple days now, they seem as if they will hold up.

Will likely consider this manufacturer the next time I buy a pair of shoes."
"I bought this for my granddaughter for her 14th birthday.  It is sized right,  the fabric is good, and the artwork is perfect.  Thanks!"
I really love these shoes. They are comfortable and make my time on the court a pleasure. I should buy another pair before they stop making them.
"Comfortable, will work well with my sports shoes and slides!"
Awesome boots! The reason I gave it four Stars is because they got white lines after wearing them in the rain and one foot looks lighter than the other after wearing them.
Comfortable and cute. Get a slightly large size
"Bought these for my adult son for his birthday and he loves them.  Guess that's why he put them on his Amazon wish list.  And, well, when he isn't wearing them, his wife wears them, so they are definitely getting used.  As far as I know, they work well.  I've heard no complaints."
I have owned many Ameribags since they first came out.  I went to regular purses for awhile but nothing compares to the Ameribag for space and ease of finding things in the bag.
"Looks great, as expected !"
The shirt fits great and it super cute. I can't wait to wear it in public and not around my room.
It is good quality but it defiantly runs big.
Perfect sandal--exactly what I was looking for. Love the print too!
The pants fit good especially the butt area but my problem is the length so I cannot wear it as a long pants and so I'm a bit disappointed with that because it's a nice pair of pants! I ordered size 9 and I am 5'7 and 154lbs...
"Like the earrings, but smaller then I thought. That just will give me the chance to wear my hair up. Delivery was on time, which was great."
Im a size 14 and purchased the xl.  Fits great.
"Beautiful, but the blue/green headband jewelry was not attached. However, my 2 month old looks adorable in the other headbands!"
"Fit as expected, are a soft comfortable material & still are in perfect condition after several washes. Love them!!!"
"Seems like a very nice product, but have not worn for any length of time yet.  Seem to fit a tad snug."
"My fiance bought me these, and I love them! They are so soft and comfortable and look like flats, not like your typical slippers. Extremely recommend!"
"Really nice chain, good quality."
This is a good sports bra for those of us with a slightly larger chest.  I've used it for a few runs now and it keeps everything in place.
"I bought my regular size and they fit well.  I have worn them for zumba and bokwa and really enjoyed the support but also lightness for dance.  I have tried three dance sneakers and these are the best so far, by long shot."
"Warm, fit great, work well for using phone, good quality"
"You cant go wrong with these shoes, these are the 3rd pair I have bought in a 3 year period. Super comfy they run a little big but I don't mind that you can wear thick socks and still be comfortable. Go for it you will not be disappointed"
Basic Hanes Women's socks really soft although I do feel like they have continued to get thinner over the years.
"This is a well-made, beautiful dress that flattered my plus-sized figure. It was true to size and I love that the fabric has some give. I received so many compliments in this dress! I felt so pretty. Although I am a curvy girl, this dress would flatter any figure. It gave me even more of an hourglass shape and ""the girls"" looked awesome! I loved how the red roses ""popped"" against the black background.  I loved it so much that I also bought one in a solid red."
Love them!!! For perfect!!
soft and silky. excellent deal.  I'll be back to order again.
Great bag...nice and roomy....strap DOES adjust for smaller waist...I am 5'1 and 115 pounds and had no problem getting a good fit. Needed a roomy yet not bulky pack and this fits the bill!
Great sturdy work pants - true fit to size.  I bought these to replace a favorite pair of work pants - these are a little heavier material and I expect they will last a long time.
"Bought this top for my daughter, she loves it."
"If I were able to order these shoes again, I would order a half size up. They are very cute, but a little bit uncomfortable (probably because they are a little snug)"
Soft and cute! Quality material.
Great classic beach flop. 100% authentic Brasil. Great for walking to and from the beach or for use as a shower shoe.
"Got these for my husband since NB is all he wears. I checked his current model (Vazee) and size so everything fit as expected. I have to say he did get measured a few years back in store, that can be hard to measure and select online only. Great for wide feet (come in widths) and high arches"
Stunning look and quality ! The silver embroidery looks like it is diamond studded ! Have received many compliments on this beautiful tie !
"Great sneaker
Fit was perfect"
"I absolutely adore these boots! I'm a flight attendant and have had them 2 yrs and they still look great. I can wear them for +12hr days and multiple  days in a row. I recommend them to everyone I work with. The calf sizing is pretty accurate too, which is great. I finally found a pair made for someone with small calves!"
"Great shirt quality, beautiful blue color.a little tight around the bust area, but that's not uncommon for many of my shirts. I'm usually a small top (2) and I ordered the same size here and it's fits as expected"
"Superb case, was pleasantly surprised to find out my Oakley Scalpel sunglasses fit.  They are large wrapped glasses that demand lots of space.  The case is high-end quality, with unique felt like material.  Couldn't be happier with this case.  ps may I recommend the red white & blue case with Hawaii design, very cool!"
"I have had zero luck with strapless bras in the past. Thanks to other reviews I decided to try and LOVE IT! It hugs the chest instead of sticking out like a shelf and it doesn't slip down your back. I wear a 34B and that's what I ordered. Yes it feels a bit tight, but I think if it was a 36 it may start to slip. But you could try fastening it on the 3rd latch. I may try that next time out of curiosity. But I am very happy with this ! Highly Recommend this strapless!!!!"
Just the shirt and price I was looking for. Very elegant!!! better than the Van Heusen shirt I just purchased for almost double the price.
"I ordered a bit big I guess.but they're nice, color is bright."
"I needed 1.50 strength but ordered what was available, 2.00. I cannot see my dashboard or gps clearly but they are good for reading."
"Fits perfectly and is soft and comfortable, one of my new favorites."
Great fit and feel... logo is not too thick and it fits my large frame as I expected....
Skinny look
"lighter weight than the one I got in my boot camp issue in 1974 but still a good, well made watch cap."
"Perfect length, and weight! Love the style and it works with every outfit. 5 stars!"
Cute but very narrow and tight
"my son loved it, but one of the swords broke 1st day though."
"Bought these to embroider for a wedding gift. They're thin, but work well for their intended use. Good for the price."
"I have EXTREMELY large thighs and these fit me! Sadly they don't stay up for long. I am around 260 lbs and about 5' 8""., they come all the way to my good stuff. :) Maybe if they offerd an even larger size and/or I get garter belts?..."
"Love this Belt, Good Company.  Think it ran a little Small though..."
"I bought a size 5 for my daughter who wears a size 4T. Wish I would've bought a 6. The size 5 fits, but won't for long. It's short."
These fit a size 14 wide men's shoe. Did a wonderful job this winter. Nice to have in vehicle for when the weather changes unexpectantly. Highly recommend.
"Not a Sexy bra, but well made for an active woman like me who needs good support.  I wouldn't usually leave a review for an under garment, but I just had to let other woman know this is the best, most comfortable and best supporting bra I've ever purchased and I've tried them all. For the busty, broad chested woman who wants an attractive, supportive well made bra that isn't huge like a girdle this ones for you. I usually wear a 38DD but ordered a size up which fit perfectly.  I will never buy another brand."
Cinderella could not have asked for a better fitting slipper.  I love the color as well.  Thank you.
"Very pretty, looks more like a smaller version of the ring in the picture though. I like it."
I am an Origami Owl designer and this was PERFECT for displaying earrings and chains.  I LOVE OWLS also!!  :-)
Very comfortable shoes.  Would recommend and they are true to size for me.
"I have owned 8-10 pair of these and I won't were anything else.  They are stylish, comfortable and extremely durable."
It fits good in my husband. He loves it specially the printing.
"So far I like the belt. Really like the idea of not having holes,  just hope the ratcheting mechanism lasts.  Really like the looks of the buckle.  Everything about the belt seems high quality."
"Bought these shorts for my two year old and could not be happier! Based on the other reviews I've read, I went up a size and got a 3. They fit him perfect with room to spare. I loved how they looked on him and they do not look/feel cheap. I'm definitely happy with this purchase! I also would recommend going up a size for anyone considering purchasing these."
Great polish. Took care of scuffs and scratches. Shoes look like new. Thank you.
perfect and dat ASS!
"Ok, First the reason why they are somewhat small is because the largest size Amazon had for these style shoes is a 12 and I and I am a size 13. I bought these for a costume and they are comfortable and easy to walk in, even though they are a bit small. I would recommend these for someone who is learning to walk in heels. The heel is the right hight and has good support.
As far as recommending on weather to order street size or order one size up/down, I have no idea. but they are worth the price."
"Fit well, great price."
"I've been wearing these shoes for trail races for a year now, I can't rave about them enough! They fit great, true to size, I've never gotten a blister, they grip everything, and also they look so snazzy! I love these shoes!"
"It didn't need the split in the back, so i took off a half star. And it is thinner than expected, hence the other half star off.. But not a deal breaker, the color is great, as shown. I am 5'2"" 154lbs and the medium still has plenty of give without being baggy. It is truly a body-con so people of my generation use undergarments without seams.  Or long sweater.  But it is not sheer.  I liked it so much I bought another.."
"I have a younger toddler with very big (long) feet for his age. He's a good walker, but not as adept as some kids 2 years+ in age. These are adorable shoes and are lightweight. I love that the soles are significant, but not so thick like some toddler athletic shoes. The lights are white and look really cool against the silver shoe. Wi"
"I ordered size 8.5 because a few reviews had described this shoe as somewhat small. For reference, I wear 8 or 8.5. These shoes fit well so far. I haven't worn them to work yet but plan to do so tomorrow. I am hoping to not get blisters around the opening of the shoe- if I do, I will edit this review. All in all, I like how these shoes look and feel, and would recommend them."
"Size is a little tight, but after break in, I'm sure they will be fine."
"A very good-looking, cushioned rubber-soled men's espadrille for casual everyday use in warm weather.  Taking advice from another customer review which said ""it runs small,""  I bought a size up, and it fits perfectly."
"Perfect if you don't want to wear a ""flat"" flip flop but still want a casual look.  Comfortable, but because the wedge tends to push my foot forward, the top straps start to dig into my foot if I'm standing for any length of time.  I like them and will probably order them in another color, too."
"Excellent and very warm, i love it! It saved my life in a cold temp"
I love this shirt. It looks so unique and different! It feels comfortable too.
"Previously gave a review of letter ""T""......wanted to spell out ""DOT"" so have all initials.
Superior quality, sturdy, good size and putting 3 in a row, no problem.
Will purchase again from Queenberry........a name to be trusted."
These are great for assisted living folk since they do not have zippers or buttons.  Great for lounging around home.
LOVE them! but the back rim a bit small and they can slip out of your lobes if they are stretchy enough.
"I have large calves and tried to buy a more ""authentic"" throw back striped tube sock, but they didn't reached my knees like these do.  Make no mistake, these are thinner, more like a poly/nylon sock than a true cotton tube sock, but they are more stretchy, and for this reason, these are the socks that are going to make my 1970s roller skate look because these actually DO reach my knee.  YAY ""1979""! LOL"
I love Sanuk. And these fit perfectly and look cute! I'm only 5'1 so I need a little extra boost. I love these.
"I bought these because my hands are always freezing when I do outdoor photography in the winter.  I liked the mitten idea because my hands freeze in finger gloves; I could keep my L hand mittened, and pop out my right gloved hand to operate the camera controls.  That idea has worked fairly well, and they do keep my hands warmer than any other gloves I've owned.  Given that they appeared to run small, though, I ordered a W's large.  So one beef is that the fingers of the interior finger glove are quite baggy on my fingers.  I wish the glove fit more snugly.  The other issue is trying to zip back up one mitten (after putting your gloved hand back into it, and the baggy thumb is rather hard to push back into the mitten thumb space) with your other mittened hand.  It's not real easy.  It helps to arch/curl the unzipped hand to stretch the mitten taut, but it's still difficult to grab the zipper pull with the other mittened hand and get it started.  I've sometimes used my teeth to pull on it.  So these mitts are workable, and pretty warm, but I wish the finger glove fit more snugly and that they were easier to zip back up."
It's a dickies work shirt. It is one of the best work shirt's I've ever used.
"I am very happy with my purchase. This is a much smaller bag compare with what I am used to, so I need to get used to take just what is essential. The leather is soft and the color as it is shown online."
"Attractive, good fit, and comfortable."
"I'm so sad to have to send them back. They're stunning, funky, but not outrageous. They've got a big round wide toe box that manages to look feminine. They fit perfectly, accommodate my bunion nicely, and are, quite unusually, not too wide in the heel. But ... all the fat had moved from the pads of my feet up to my hips, and it just hurts too much to walk on even this much of a heel. I'm going to have to trade these in for the Cobb Hill Avery, which, though not ugly, will not make whatever I'm wearing look fashionable -- but they have lots of padding in the metatarsal area. I'm envious of those of you who can wear these."
Nice for price good ring guards
"Beautiful ring, very well made.  Lettering is very crisp.  Love!"
"Comfortable, light and easy on your feet. Good grip on wet surfaces and quiet too. Good boots if you stand on concrete for long periods."
"I liked the swimsuit but I had to return it because the top was too padded for my liking. I expected it to add some volume but I didn't realize it would be a Wonderer. I guess it is great if that's what you're looking for but I had no interest in that particular feature. Otherwise, it's fairly well made and comfortable."
Can't beat the price. Has a silky feel to it. Looks great over a v neck. Was a tad small.
good but big
"They completely met my expectations. Good quality and good looking. Except for this - the folding sunglasses are extremely convenient - they do not occupy much place in the bag, it is also possible to keep them in a pocket! Would definetely recomend Ray Ban Fold Wayfarer Sunglasses to a friend."
"Love the colors but the bag is to small for my needs, unfortunately."
"I love these sandals! I wear them with dresses, boot cut jeans, & capris. They are very comfortable."
"It's not the same swim suit as shown in the picture, but it's still the same print. But I received it 2 weeks early, and fits great."
"So, so comfy!"
"Highly recommended specially because they are true to size and looks great!
Good price too! I've only had these shoes for a couple of weeks and worn them one, but I'm satisfied!"
"Had my last ones for 8 years and wore them pretty much all summer every year, plus for other outings. They were still wearable and hadn't broke on me, but I decided the bottom was a little thin and I should just get new ones so I had more foot support. Highly recommend."
"I love how soft these pants are! I only gave them 4 stars simply because they were quite large for my youngest, who normally wears this size (and whom needed the pants) but I was able to give them to my oldest daughter and buy another in a smaller size. Smaller size fit great and my daughters both love the pants!"
Great material and amazing feel.
Dress looks and fits great!  I wore it to church and received several compliments.
Decent quality. Needs a few sewing tacks or velcro to hold the fur to lay correctly. Good length on my tall hubby (6'3)
"I have been wearing these for over a decade.  They need to be replaced about once a year or so but I wear them non-stop in the house.  I have tried other brands, they don't hold a candle to the comfort of these.  12 EE fits as expected."
Really cute suit
"Fit exactly as we had expected and my 4yr old loved it... still wears it often. Fine enough fabric/construction. Overall, good product that got the point across to the grand-parents ;o)"
I ve seen cheap ones and this isn't one of them.  Review for product
"Cute, sure to be the go to shorts once my 4y old grows into the 4t."
"Great, casual bootie, it's soft and comfortable, but it's too small! At least a half size too small. I have three pair of Cobb Hill shoes and they are all size 8. These are 8, but simply too small. I might wear them around the house to see if my ""summer feet"" are just rebelling or order 8.5."
Used these for a Mexican wrestler costume for my 10 months old and they were perfect!! Love the strips on the feet so he can walk around in them.
"okay so I'm a girl but needed some socks to wear with leather boots in fall & winter - not too thick, not too long, just regular black socks.  These are EXACTLY what I was hoping for, I wasn't sure from the description, but they are comfy and just the right thickness for leather boots, they don't fall down and they aren't too tall so they don't create bulk under trousers or leggings etc.  Also, they launder well, and because they have an insignia on the underside of the sock they are very easy to pair when they come out of the dryer!  I'm very pleased."
"Good basic shorts. Maybe slightly small, but they work. Good for under dresses, which is what I bought them for."
For the price this is goid top. Fits good. Not tight on me at all. Material is comfortable. So far I'm satisfied with this purchase.
These Pajamas are a great and comfortable fit! and the company is awesome!
"This product is from China, in spite of what the description said. It arrived sooner than expected, which is a good thing, and the quality is fine. It does seem to run very small. I ordered a L/XL and was concerned that it would be too large. I am a 10/12. This fits well but I certainly wouldn't want the waist any tighter...it makes me wonder if they shipped the wrong size, however there is no label. I would recommend."
I read the reviews and ordered down 1/2 size. I normally wear 8 1/2 US. I ordered an 8. Fits perfectly. Very comfy. Very stylish. Perfect for going to The theater or museums or walking in the city. I now have 2  pair.
I loved this from the get go but ordered a 14 inch chain and found  it was too small.
This dress is so cute!  Even my Ex-husband liked it. LOL.  Beautiful stiching and drapes flatteringly.  Dressy but not overly formal.  But buy a slightly larger size than a USA size.  I wear a medium but the large fit great.
"Perfect size for a carry on jewelry box my wife loves it ,definitely a good buy. Im actually buying another one again for my in-law"
"I've always been a FOTL advocate, so when the time came to travel to humid, sweaty parts of the world where I wouldn't mess with itchy, uncomfortable underwire bras, I decided to give these well-priced sports bras a shot. And they totally delivered. Super comfortable, super breathable, never stretched or pilled even after multiple hand and machine washes, and good, tight coverage for the more conservative moments where a v-neck slip could have been disastrous. These are now in regular rotation for my gym trips, too. FOTL, I salute you!

Women with larger busts may need more support but anyone with mosquito bites like my girls should be very satisfied."
Levi's
"The sleeves of this sweater are slightly loose on the arm, but overall it is a great addition to her school uniform."
Nice casual dress. Love the feel.
This is the fourth pair of these that my husband uses for work. They are very warm and well made.
"I have worn these shoes for years, ever since they came on the market. They're the only ones that enable me to have a vigorous walk without debilitating knee pain. I always keep a new box in the closet as backup; every time I wear out a pair I open my new box & order a backup. It's really hard to find true wide women's shoes; these fit my feet true to size, have comfy room & no pinched toes. I only wish I could get them in more colors; the color options I found were ridiculously over priced from scalpers. Thanks to this seller I can still afford my very favorite shoes."
This should be in every dancer's wardrobe.  Perfect for shows because you can not see the straps and great for quick changes when there are other people around and you don't have any privacy to change.
"This little rain coat is wonderful.

First of all, it protects against the rain. I've been out in the rain with my daughter and she stayed completely dry. Granted, it wasn't a downpour, but I'm fairly confident it would hold up to a pretty strong rain. Also, the hood is deep enough to easily cover her whole head.

Second, it seems very well made. The stitching and snaps and every seem sturdy. I've only had it a few weeks so I can't speak to its durability but it seems like it will last.

Third, it's adorable. She is so ridiculously cute it in!

Regarding size: my daughter is 21m, 80th percentile for height and weight. The 24m (which is 18-24m) fits her perfectly, but she probably doesn't have a whole lot of room to grow. There weren't any 2Ts available when I bought this, and I really needed a rain coat for her, but if I'd had a choice I would have gone with the 2T. It wouldn't have fit as well right now but it would have lasted longer. Still, for now the 24m is a perfect fit and will probably last several months."
This bag arrived as described/pictured. The large is perfect for a work tote that can fit a laptop computer. The straps and zippers seem sturdy. I would definitely recommend this for the price!
"Favorite running shoes. Been wearing this make and model for 15 years. I run an average of six miles a day/42+ miles /week. Never had a running related injury.  Super cushioned , great support.  I always wear running shoes in 1/2 size larger than foot size."
"I've been wearing them for over 20 years, obviously I like them a lot!"
Purchased as a gift and my husband loves it. it is soft and gets softer each time it is washed. Well made and great for work wear. I will need to by more.
"Very nice shirt. I bought this for my husband. He's 6'3"" and 190 # and he loves this shirt. It's attractive and well made."
"i would recommend this watch to everyone, easy to read, the indiglo dial is great in the middle of the night the watch is sleek and gorgeous, looks like an expensive braclet!"
"It's a very nice ring box with LED light when you open it.  The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the LED light is not only bright enough in my opinion but it needs to be positioned at a slightly better angle so that it can illuminate the fire of a Diamond little bit more.
But if you are not putting a Diamond ring in it, I think it would not matter much.  The color of the Box and velvet inside is really nice and I recommend getting it if you are looking for a pretty box."
It is just perfect! It is soft and feels nice.
I am in love. I'm a MUXXN customer now. The fabric is thick and doesn't feel cheap. It has the perfect shape and it is gorgeous!
"I'm a big fan of the Liverpool brand. These capris were no exception! Fit is great and I love the dark wash. These do stretch out as the day goes on, so keep that in mind if you tend to straddle sizes."
"This is a set of 3 pair of small solid silver earrings. The decorative fronts of the earrings are about 1/4"" in diameter, so they are well-sized for small ears. The posts are 3/8"" long with rounded backs and silicone grips. The designs are simple yet appealing: elephants, 4-leaf clovers, and crosses. The earrings ship all mounted on a single piece of cardboard inside a small pink cardboard box.

I got these for a five-year-old. She liked them a lot. The only thing that I worry about with these earrings is the rounded backs--they don't seem very secure, so the earrings could get lost easily. On the other hand, the silicone grips seem quite secure, so that's what I would go for first."
"We've had this for 2 year, it cleans easily, fits a lot of jewelry, it opens and closes softly so it doesn't sound like you're slamming things around in the morning"
My granddaughter wore this costume this Halloween past. She loved it!
"The sizing of these very light-weight cardigans is somewhat uneven in terms of length (the light blue is shorter), but they are soft and drape well"
"My son is so happy! The green is so bright and he loves them. These shoes are a very big deal with the suburban 7 year old crowd, and they have been terribly difficult to find. We had these in 2 days! I have a very happy son!"
"This is a nice watch for the price. PROS: easy to tell time day or night or underwater; rugged; not too heavy.  CONS: stiff band is slightly uncomfortable; no alarm; no stopwatch feature. This is a good, basic, inexpensive Divers/Swimmers watch."
"Contrary to reviews I read on here, these DO NOT run large and if anything run small.  I normally wear a size 7.5 and after reading other reviews claiming they run large, ordered a size 7 which is most definitely too small.  I am now having to send these back in exchange for an 8.  They are NOT roomy and personally would order a size up, and certainly if you wear a half size.  They are flannel lined at the top and have a nice sturdy sole. The color is more that of weathered/distressed black leather and quite thin.

Revised Update:  It took a week for these boots to grow on me for the price tag.  What these boots lack in substance they do make up for in attitude, and plenty of it.  They do look great tucked into jeans over thick socks and should do nicely on the motorcycle on mild days.  The leather is thinnish and soft,so no ankle support but the sole is thick and comfortable.  I was able to snag a pre-owned pair of Timberlands Women's Lexiss boots off of eBay in excellent condition for a fraction of the cost for serious riding but will keep these for fun."
"Very light weight, confortable tennis; I like them a lot."
"Been wearing these since they came out.  Even though they don't have a fly, I love them for the fit and the fabric.  They also last a long time."
"I have hats with me almost all the time, as my blue eyes are very sensitive to sunlight.  I ordered this one in pink because I thought it had a very fun appearance - the touch of bling with sequins makes it great for barbecues or other outdoor socials.  The hat is sturdy and cleanly stitched.  This is definitely NOT one of the cheaply made products we so often come across.  My favorite part, though, is that it came with its own storage bag.  It is such a minor detail, and may not matter to most, but personally I love it!

I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  I hope you have found my observations helpful."
Grandaughter lived them fit as expected great wualitu
It fit my father-in-law to the tee and they were very well packaged.
Excelente estado y buen calidad
shoes is very beautifu
"Husband loves it, but he loves Carhartt clothing,its just a little expensive but you do get what you pay for. Good material,washes real good  and they seem to last forever"
Nice looking boot.  The inners oleg are a bit thin and not very supportive.  They appear waterproof although I have not tested them that way.
Makes a big difference in staying warm
Dad seems to like them
Good  enough quality but generous sizing.
These are very stylish.  Look just like ones that cost 10x the price.
Great quality and price !!
"I fell in love with these online, and they are just as cute in person! My daughter loves them, they are warm and have great soles for snow or weather. When will they make these in adult sizes?"
Really like these sandals..a little more dressy than flip flops so they are very versatile. These sandals do fit narrow.  I tend to always wear a medium width (eg. BORN shoes) and I am glad I ordered these in the wide(w) width after reading some reviews.  They fit great!! I liked them so much I also ordered them in cognac :)
This is my Daughters second pair and she really like this specific pair of the 11s.
"I am small chested so my review differs from others, but I absolutely love these adhesive bras. They cover, provide slight support and padding, and stay up. They last for 2-3 weeks of regular wear, and even longer if you do not wear them everyday. love this product."
Bought them as work boots for someone who's outside in the elements.  He loves them so much and they are so comfortable he even wears them out. Great shoes.
I love these shoes! Easy to slip on and they look good with almost everything.
"Work well, look great.  Excellent value for the price."
"Very cute, but not as comfy as the Kaylee-H pumps and the sizes are not always consistent. I ordered different colors, two were 7.5 and one was an 8, I think the eight is a tiny bit smaller than the 7.5."
Ordered a pair to try them. Very warm and happy with them. Ordered 2 more pair.
I like this ring. It is well constructed and looks stunning.
"I am a little busty, but the shirt fits great other than that"
leather is easily scratched and wrinkled.
perfect for costumes!! used as a prop also
I bought this shirt for my daughter and her friend.  They both love it and they look cute in them.
Great overalls exactly what I expected
"I bought these for my husband. He likes them a lot, and the elastic is holding good after several months. They wash really nice. The legs don't gap like so many pairs of underwear, but they are not too tight either for the average size leg (at least that's how I'd describe my husband). These newer pairs are softer than the ones of the past. Good advantage. I suggest you try them...."
i had the Croc Modi before and it sells for $10 more. I would recommend that as probably the best flop ever. The Baya is good value for this money but not quite as comfortable and has a small ridge at the toe line (for grip) that takes getting used to.
Very nice quality.  Bought 2. True to size. Would buy again
"I got these so quick. I felt like I just ordered them. I am so very very impressed. These are not see through, they fit amazing, extremely comfortable, and the absolute perfectly length. I will be purchasing more! Also loved the recept, someone wrote ""thank you :)"""
I love these sneakers.. comfy and stylish
Killer shades  Wish they were made for a little fatter face but they are built to last
Nice dress love it it's worth it I normally orders biggers size so the clothes last longer
very warm and cool at the same time. well actually i'm cool. the jacket is just very warm. don't get it twisted.
Great Wrap/Head Gear. This one is the best made one I've purchased yet and it looks great on. High Quality. Fits Great. Attractive. Highly Recommend.
"Update: as previously stated husband repurchase this boots again. The last pair lasted him 7 months considering the type of work he does, that's almost double the time diehard boots would last him. He's definitely made this his official work boots will definitely keep buying more.

My husband loved this! He would always buy diehards for work and would go through them pretty fast, and with every new pair he would complained about how uncomfortable they were and how it hurt to break them in. I bought him this he loved them, he said they're super comfortable, it didn't hurt to break them and the leather is holding on pretty well. If we could I'm sure he would rate them 10 stars, I will definitely purchase again."
"I live it very much and looks very nice.  However, I wish it was just slightly shorter so that it would sit higher on the neck."
"Really good quality like all Tesla products. I am 6-3 190 pounds and the large is a standard fit. Will order medium for.more Slim fit look. Very simple design , like a track jacket , two very big pockets, no zipper on pockets . Light but warm."
Ring fits great and looks great; just what I was looking for in a good sterling silver ring.
Love this dress it fit over my rather large baby bump and still looked good needed some slight alteration in the chest area but im a perfectionist
"Very comfortable and size ordered fits.  A really bad draw back is when you get these wet inside where the strap fits.
The odor is gross, gross enough to throw out.  Tilex mold and mildew sprayed inside helps."
"super cute. runs big, which is good because he'll get a lot of wear out of it."
like the ring
"this worked really well for me when i had put on about 20 lbs.  flattened stomach and trimmed thighs.  no spillover anywhere.  surprisingly comfortable.  i wore it this summer, and i live in arizona."
"Nothing wrong to say, just the right fit for an under shirt."
Help reduce swelling.
"5'6"", 170 lbs, ordered the large and it fit great.  Sleeves are the right length, top zips fine, bottom is little loose.  Fabric is thin and perfect for a cool summer night or morning.  Ordered the grey, pictured as dark, but actually much lighter, looks good regardless."
"Probably the most comfortable bra ever! The only ""down"" side is that it can't be machine washed and has to be hand washed."
I bought it for my husband because he wanted it. He says he likes it and he wears it a lot.
A little long. Had to him them from dragging but otherwise wonderful!
Fit is great they washed up nice so far no shrinkage! I have purchased more of these in different colors!!!
My only (minor) complaint is that the clasp is very small and might be difficult for larger hands to secure.
"Little tighter then I anticipated, but ended up being super cute and flattering. It's short, so I wear it with leggings."
"I really like this top. I ordered it in grey/silver and the beige. I read in one of the reviews to be sure to order Uget because various companies sell this shirt but they are not all made the same. Soooo glad I took her advice because I made sure to order the Uget top and I am not disappointed. I generally wear a medium top and I range between a size 12 -14 clothes. I'm 5'2 and weigh 169 lbs. I took the advice and ordered a large and I'm glad I did because I definitely wanted it to hang off the shoulder. It's loose and comfortable and I think you can wear it with jeans, leggings or dress slacks! And with the right accessories, you can make it look classier than its price tag. Thumbs up!!"
"I love this shoe, but wish I would  have gone up 1/2 size."
"These were for my son, and he loves them."
"Love these long (top of thigh), no adornment, stretchy camisoles. Perfect for layering, and won't roll up because they're long, come in a large selection of colors and sizes. Bought first one in Camel to wear under long, sheer blouse. After realizing how comfy and versatile they are, I ordered 4 more colors. Love them!"
My Wife loves these earrings. She says they are beautiful and very easy to put on and take off.
My grandson was in heaven when I was able to replace his lost mask through Amazon.com so thank you!
if you want to support your Police Department here's a shirt to buy
"Teva, what can I say.  Really good quality."
"These are very comfy, the yoga mat surface feels slightly tacky ( yet not sticky) at first, ,not unlike a yoga mat, but after wearing them for a day that feeling went away and they are now my every day everywhere VERY comfy flip flop!
I find them priced well and plan to order several pair in different colors."
Super cute and i can protect my har
I should have paid attention to the reviews but took a chance anyway.  It's a very nice shoe but it really does run small.  I'd recommend ordering at least a 1/2 size up.  I had to return these and was disappointed there were none available in a larger size for me.
super stretch and very comfortable.shipping was longer then I expected.
"I normally wear small, but do not care for sleepwear to be too fitted. This is o.k., but can't wear a shirt under it."
"I really love this jacket! The design is awesome,  it matches well with just about any dress and dark pair of jeans. Everytime I wear this jacket at work, my students say I'm amongst the coolest. Basically,this jacket is perfect for the person that likes to add a little spunk to their business work attire. The material of this jacket is durable ( will last for years), the style is appealing ( will definitely get you plenty of compliments), the fit is wonderful ( feminine cut) and the price is fair."
A little bit big but cute.
"I'm so glad I found these on Amazon.  I bought them in black in the store but can no longer find them there.  I absolutely love these boots, I have them in both black and brown, in fact I'm on my second pair of black  They're the perfect heel height....not so tall to make your feet and legs ache yet tall enough to look good with dress pants, leggings or dress.  I also wear them with my skinny jeans for a sexy dressed-up...but not too much...look.  I have a closet full of shooties but these seem to be my go to more often than the others."
"Cute rain jacket.  I am 5'6"" and 150# and bought a large and it fits well.  I wanted it to be a little on the larger size for layering clothes.  The material  is a little on the thin side but it does the job.  I wore it out on a wet and windy day and it was great.  You can tie the hood securely over your head.  Plus I got compliments on it."
A very nice looking warm coat.
"This is a stunningly gorgeous coat! Fits and flatters, great texture, warm, stylish. Love it so much. I would love to see it in a blue grey or another color some time. I would buy it again. Im so thrilled!"
Love them. Very good panties for a guy.
"Second pair, same order.  These have closed in toe for warmth.  You can never regret Dearforms.  I have had so many pair, I would never buy another brand!!"
Super cute! Can dress it up or wear it down!
I hate sleeping in something that makes me sweat...these pants are perfect.
"This is my 5th or 6th pair of these.  Usually wear them for 6 to 9 months
It's the only kind of work boot that fits me.  Very solidly built"
Awesome! !!
"They are a tiny, tiny bit smaller than I'd expected but going up another 1/2 size wouldn't have worked so I stuck with these expecting they might stretch a little after being worn. This is my 3rd pair of ASICS and they fit well on my feet!"
These are great but run small. Get a half size bigger at least
"I usually wear a size 10, to be a little roomy for me. I like to be able to wiggle my toes around. The size 10 of tesla fits great. I tried a 9 1/2 and it was a little narrow at the toes for me personally.

Also, I recommend taking the insole out right away. It just slips through the day and works its way backward. I wear them very often, no socks, no insole. Machine washable if needed (I've washed once or twice)

For the price, they are great. I just ordered my second pair."
"No bacon neck here! LOL. Love this shirt due to heavy weight, strong collar, and short sleeve length almost to bend at elbo. I am 6' 3"" about 198 lbs, somewhat wide shoulders and it fits great (XL). If !neck too tight you can stretch it a bit for comfort and its awesome"
great flip flop fit great and have a nice arch support I love them and they are sharp looking also recommend to all
"I actuallyy thought this product was a size smaller than i ordered, but i guess i ordered a size larger, but its ok. I still wear it... its so thin and breezy, Im currently out in Iraq and i wear it for these Summer days that are about to get unleashed on me... I love it! Im buying the correct size in a few weeks..."
"Bought these for my girlfriend as a gift for her birthday.  She fell in love with how they looked at first sight upon opening the box.  She couldn't wait to put them on and see how they would look with some of her outfits. At that time she fell in love with them for the second time.  She absolutely loves them for their looks and their fit.  She claims that they are very comfortable and looks forward to wearing them more often.  And to be honest, so am I.  She looked great in them just as I hoped she would."
My favorite sneaker. I wear it for work and to workout.
good full chunky or swollen feet.
"Ordered as a gift for my dad. He has a hard time finding pullovers/hoodies that have long enough arm length.
Excellent quality, color was spot on & it fit him perfectly.
Will order these again!"
Fits as expected and nicer than I expected.
"Bought these for our 25 yr. old grandson.  He thinks we are hip grandparents for ordering this nice pair of shoes.  Says they are his favorite and he wears them a lot!  Very comfortable and the fit is perfect says he!  So glad we were able make this purchase without knowing what is ""in"" for the younger crowd.....such wise grandparents we are.."
In living in these. Helping my back hips knees and ankles
Good purchase but sleeve a little shorter than I like. I am wearing one now by coincidence and writing this review weeks after purchase.
"Sexy, I look great in it."
"Beautiful shoe, the picture does not give the shoe any justice, wait until you see the shoe,and oh when you put them on your feet feels good and simply beautiful. I got mine you better get yours."
I love Port Authority fleece jackets.  This variety has zipper pockets and no elastic at the sleeves.  It also has a large vertical open interior pocket on each side of the zipper  It is very warm and is full cut.
I absolutely love this boots. The fit is true to size. They are so warm and my feet stay warm and dry. They are very light boots. And the prize is very inexpensive.
It's very good material and fiting nicely
The gowns are great. Soft and work great when changing diapers. They say its for a new born but are a little larger than expected.
"These shoes are great, reasonably flexible sole (more flexible than similar Sketchers), but still grippy and durable enough for an active toddler.  True to size (or maybe ever so so slightly long, but that's not a problem with constantly growing toddlers!)."
Beautiful!! Fast service.
"As with all my Clarks shoes, they are immediately more comfy than any other shoe and become more so after some wear. They are the 4th pair I own and I'll be getting more...I may never buy another brand. They are lightweight, too."
"Man - This pant is great and excellent quality.
Fitting is so comfortable as it has adjustable waist.
Recommended to buy it."
Love the skirt !!! Such beautiful material ! Definitely worth the purchase . I am typically between a size 6 and eight so I had a hard time deciding whether to go with the small or medium. I ordered a small but it is a tad snug at the waist.  I would be afraid the pretty wide band at the waist would fold in half if I sat down so I went ahead and ordered the medium. It hasn't arrived yet so we'll see how that fits .  And LOVE the pockets. I would definitely consider ordering the skirt in other colors if the medium is a good fit.
Love this dress! The material is thick making it not transparent
"Nice sandals, good price!"
So happy with this purchase!  I've gotten several compliments on them.  They feel very soft and are very comfortable.  Highly recommend.
This is a great shoe and fits very comfortable
Little bit small for what I wanted but it is great for traveling in hotel safes
The sandals look very nice and are both comfortable and stylish for my little one .
"I just got these today at cost co for a cheaper price and I like them very much. I went running for one hour already and they are comfortable and fit as expected. I usually have issues with the waistband and these did not give me any issues, which is a lot already. I hope they will somewhat last so I can keep wearing them."
"Love this little beanie for my infant. It's a bit large for my 3 mo old, so it slides around a bit, but still does the job. I hope to get a lot of use out of it. Nice and soft. Good quality. Arrived on time."
My 3 year old has wide feet so it can be hard to find shoes that fit her. I took a chance and ordered these in the size she is currently wearing and they fit great. The handles make them super easy for her to quickly put on herself. They are rugged and sturdy so it looks like they should last until she grows again.
"The shirt was not as fitted as I'd expect. I'm 6'1'', 200lbs. The shirt was a little big on me. Flaps in the wind. I bought the XL side because I was told that they run a little small. They don't."

You can bring your nerd on with this, or show off your love towards caffeine with this delicate piece of jewelry. This sure turns so many heads because they will be intrigued.
I wore this to Universal studios yesterday, not a fine place to where but this necklace has flair that shouts casual and elegant at the same time, and am not lying when it got some attention.
Here's a quick fact about caffeine, if you are decaf person don't think you are not getting any caffeine because decaf does not mean caffeine free.
This necklace makes a great gift and it's one of the prettiest necklaces I have seen.
The only think I wish it had were a few more links so that i can adjust the length of the necklace.

I have received this product in exchange for an honest review"
Love this!!! Haven't used it yet but I can tell that it's good quality and durable. Zipper is great and it's waterproof too!
"Wife uses this to get the stubborn hairs that she misses after shaving or in areas that cause to much irritation.  This is not meant for removing large swaths in your deforestation ritual. So you will need your preferred method of removal or partial removal first.

This is great for getting those annoying hairs that seem to defy the blade or trimmer.  So unless you are waxed completely or have gone through laser hair removal, you will have some fuzz here and there.

It is not noxious like Nair.  It's not painful like a wax.  The only complaint is it's a little pricey for 2 ounces.  But if you like to have that total smooth look or smooth in some areas and you need help, this is a wonderful think to have.

Update - be careful not to leave it on too long because it will cause irritation."
I bought this as a gift to represent my friendship to my best friend and they were perfect! She loved it and I believe they will last a long time.. we've only had them a couple of days now.. but it seems pretty solid and has a nice little weight to it. Im thinking of buying one for every member of my family. We are all a piece of one big puzzle. The price is unbeatable and they shipped faster than I expected. Thank you for a nice quality product will definitely buy again.!
They fit a little narrow. I had to send them back and order a wide. They have great arch support and were very comfortable otherwise.
"I love this swimming suit. The top fit great, but the bottoms were a bit snug. Oh well...it will give me something to work towards! Overall, the suit is very flattering!"
"Arrived on time and well packaged. I ordered my size 36C and it fits as it should. For reference purposes I am 5`5`and weight 150lbs. The bra actually looks better than pictured and is comfortable for an underwire bra. The fabric is soft, sheer, (unlined) and the straps are a little wider (which I like) This provides some additional support but allows more comfort when adjusted properly."
"This was a blind buy, having never bought this brand before.  Good fit, comfy and the right length for me to move about comfortably during my workouts."
One of the best products for leather!
These were great! They held up well and I may rebuy them... I had them for just under a year and wore them frequently before I wore through the bottom of one.
Great shoes!! I played the game for softball and I really am enjoying them.
"Love it, so awesome to be able to see the time in low light conditions"
"This is pretty cute. It seems like it runs a bit small. My daughter is about 4 ft tall and 50 lbs... she is pretty thin and there was pretty much no give. The print was cute and it was in a nice little zipper bag. She really liked it. I probably would not purchase again due to it seeming slightly small.

I received this product at a discount for review purposes."
This is a very cute shoe for both office and casual outtings. I ordered a half size smaller based on other reviews but that didn't work out for me. The shoe fits snug so half size larger wouldve been the best route for me. Im disappointed I have to return them bc i had to wait 2 extra days and thses r really cute. 
my boots fit great. I wear a 6.5 but all the reviews said they run big so I got a size 6 and they are a perfect fit. Thanks to everyone who gave a review and helped me get the correct size. Hope this helps the next person.
The part that covers the breasts is lined with black fabric so no chance of nip seeping through.  The top is comfortable and really cute. Worth it.
Beautiful earrings. I purchased to replace a pair of lapis earrings I had from QVC. I feel the quality of this product is just as good as the ones I owned from QVC. Great detail and very light on the ears. I would recommend these to others!
"Ladies, your significant other will love you in this.  I didn't think it was going to be my boyfriend's number one choice, but he loved this as soon as I put in on.  Trust me, you will feel sexy when you wear it.  It's also very stretchy, so it can fit a range of sizes.  When I first took it out of the bag, I thought there was no way that I would be able to fit in on, but trust me, it will fit.  It stretches considerably so.  Definitely recommend."
Repeat customer. Always happy with my purchases from Leggings Depot.
"I went to the Haflinger site to find out how to measure my foot for this shoe. I picked out the sock thickness I wanted to wear stepped on a ruler, and took the measurement. I then matched it to the euro size, and got the correct size. It's all good. If I want to wear without socks then they are a little big but I wear socks so it doesn't matter. This is my third pair of Haflingers, and I really like all of them.  I am very pleased."
Seems to be the right size. Only costed me 2.75$ so very worth the money
"This watch arrived on time, well packaged and in good order. It's a little smaller than I had expected and so turns on my wrist and I have to readjust it's position in order to see it. IF it were about 15% larger that would probably not be a problem. I very much like the option of lighting the back of the watch to read the time in the dark."
"First bi-fold wallet, not crazy about it but it works."
This is a beautiful piece.  Even better looking in person.  I love it!
"I love these sandals.  They are extremely comfortable and very attractive.  I have only worn them to work but, I think they would suffice if I were to ""dress up.""  These sandals are the most comfortable I have worn for a long time.  I am very pleased with this purchase."
Love it. As expected and true to size.
"Fast shipping, fabric is silk on inside and a soft on the outside. Amazing quality. Ajustiable hat. I ordered a XL for my husband and he's 6 foot and 140lbs and the charge was a great fit and left a little room to put a sweater under for the cold on Halloween. A great buy."
"I love this bra, it doesn't dig into my back. Would definitely buy more of the same! Thanks Bali for making it!"
Beautiful and feminine! I saw the same ones at an art festival for double the price from Amazon.  They take a little longer to arrive but they are worth the wait.  Very comfortable with several holes to adjust the length.
"These are pretty nice looking shoes, especially for the price. they don't have much in the way of cushioning or support, but I didn't expect them to. I originally bought a size 9 which is what i wear in most shoe brands but it was too tight to put on, though in retrospect i should have probably tried to stretch those out/wear them in a bit. I returned them and got a half size up, and it fit better, but now a few months later has become a bit looser than I would like. They are nice, like any leather boot be prepared to wear them in a bit before they fit comfortably. I wish they would have had a bit of cushioning so if i did want to wear them to walk around the city it would be more comfortable but for the price they are great."
"I got these today, they are super soft and comfy. Im 5'6 230lb. They fot good but seem a little tight. And a little long. But overall glad I purchased"
Gorgeous! And very Glamorous!
Comfortable and sticky.
LoveIt!!!
Very pretty!  I received many compliments on this dress.  Flattering for any figure.
"They are a lot lighter than I thought they would be. The sole is a rubberized compound that seems to hold up well. Really nice brown color. More on the flat nose style, but a good looking comfortable shoe."
"This was my first time buying cycling glasses on Amazon and I couldn't be happier! These glasses are great. I've used them for both road biking and mountain biking. They're super comfortable, they don't fog up and so far they've held up well. I purchased a second set of the same style with the night green lenses for night time riding, and they too deliver with great eye pertection and are super comfy. I choose these instead of others because they are not polorized, which can cause issues when viewing LCD bike computer screens. I wouldn't necessarly say these compare to Oakleys or Nikes, but for the price they can't be beat. Highly recommended!"
I must say that I did not expect this watch to  be as great as it is. I'm impressed. Great feel and weight to it and all around great quality. I will be ordering another in the two-tone.
"White is always a nice color to wear. It support and hugs me just right
The bamboo fabric is what I've been missing from a life of cotton jones."
"My husband just needed some shirts for work that he could get dirty. These were perfect. Perfect fit, no complaints from him."
I just placed a follow up order for another package of these so I would say that I am satisfied.  Overall they are better than the cheaper ones that I have bought previously.  Thicker without being uncomfortably thick... I hope that makes sense.
My hubby like it.
"I modified it, but worked perfect."
Glad this item came back into stock. The only boxers my sons will wear.
I'm very happy with these slippers mostly because they come in a size larger than women's 10! It is so hard to find slippers that fit size 11! They are a bit narrow but luckily I have slightly narrow feet so they fit perfectly. They are very comfortable and are exactly what I wanted for using when I'm at home.
Looked great. A little too small.
"I was very pleased with the quality of this product and the packaging and shipping was fine, but I had to return this, because they were too small. No problems with this company."
Buy it ladies but beware you may get unrelenting excitement from your man when he sees your breasts and N----- along with everything else tempting- makes you look thin too!
It is very cute flat shoes. good!
Product was as described. I'm very pleased with them. I'm using them everyday and feel great on my feet.
This is the second pair I have purchased to replace my overly used first pair.  I can't say enough wonderful things about these hiking boots. I bought my first pair last year to go hiking in Scotland.  They held up under some soggy and rough terrain.  They are definitely waterproof since I did a lot of walking in the rain and they kept my feet warm and dry.  I love the color combination of gray with blue.  These are not just your average somber looking hiking boots.  They are fashionable in addition to being practical.  I do hope Hi-Tec continues to make these hiking boots because I will continue to purchase them in the future to replace my current pair.
True to size. Fits great! Mine son loved them!
Great quality!!! Fast shipping! The metal is stainless steel and a pefect fit.
"Sexy, silky dream!"
Glasses are perfect for my boyfriend's John Lennon Halloween costume!  Thanks so much!
I like these. As soon as I get home I put them on. nice and warm. get some.
"had the black as well as the white pair for two years.  I reordered both because they are perfect for dress up or dress down, comfortable. And I get stopped constantly all over the world(I take them everywhere with me) by people asking the brand and where I got them.  Even men have complimented me on them. They are a hit."
Good little catch it all tray. Its a tough leather and it looks good on my dresser. Good thing to have to keep everything from you pocket going everywhere.
Great cami for layering or pjs. I'm 34D bust size and the shelf bra is great support.
Quality lace work!  The small fit as expected.  Classy piece.
"I love everything about this watch. This is my 4th Casio watch. My first G-shock was purchased in 2004, it was a regular G-shock (non-solar, non-atomic) and it came with a 8-year battery life. I'm happy to report that it is still going strong (even after 11 years). I dropped that watch on cement pavement, banged it against the door and even took a dip into the pool a couple of times... and my g-shock handled all that without breaking a sweat. So after discovering the toughness of these watches, I bought few more casio g-shock and pathfinder watches and I absolutely love them all. I find these to be a perfect balance of technology, product build quality and price. They are a very nicely engineered timepieces. Also, I like the general style of these rather large and sometimes gaudy casio watches. Although, I might never understand the value of a $1500 MT-G but I will gladly pay $350 for an atomic, solar, titanum, 200m water resistant awesome looking watch. As for this particular watch here, I like that its black so I can wear it to work everyday. The bright orange highlights near the edges of the crown/strap make it stand out without looking gaudy. The numbers and other detail inside the dial is very pretty. The metal body of the watch (underneath the rubber face) is not exactly black (more like grayish-greenish tinge) and it looks really good. The rubber strap felt slightly thin at first but feels absolutely perfect now. If it would have been any thicker, it wouldn't be as comfortable on the wrist. Upon receiving the watch, setting up the time was not intuitive but I watched a video on youtube and figured it out. I don't care about any of its outdoor features and will never use them. I'm just glad that this watch will last me a lifetime and since its solar, it will never have to be taken into a watch repair shop for changing batteries and stuff. I don't know about you but I could never look at my watch the same way once its been to the repair shop."
I have three pair of sketchers.  Two golf shoes and one walking shoe.  My new favorites.
"Really nice shirt , excellent quality and washes and drys great ... husband loves it !"
"Fit really good , comfy too looks super cute on"
Love it! Guys great
Fit perfectly and great quality for the price. I would definitely buy these again.
"Excellent sunglasses. Very light, I see no distortion in the lens (here's looking at you Walmart). Dark lenses, fit perfectly.

Honestly, I can finally retir e my Maui Jim's so I don't lose them.

Update: they are a bit small. Smaller faces preferred. I ended up returning them and getting suncloud excursion glasses instead. The suncloud are bigger, but have the same quality.

Honestly, if you are on the edge, get these and see if you like them. They are a great value."
"I live in Dallas, where I got school, but travel back home as often as I can. I usually pack for 2,3 days and have been using two backpacks. So, decided to get a duffel back that can fit everything I need and is easy to carry.

This duffel back looks great, is good quality, is lightweight, and the perfect size for me (medium). It has a ventilated pocket for shoes (can fit two pairs), a front side pocked, and a inside pocket. Overall great buy!"
They are pretty good shoes. I'm a 7.5 and I read the reviews and I decided to go with a 7 because I was afraid the 8 would be to big. The 7 is a little snug not to bad. If you don't want you shoe falling off the back of your heel get a 7 but if you want more room to let your feet breathe and all that the I would get and 8
Nice sweater at a good price..at least 2 sizes too small..had to exchange
Adorable but my grandson wears a 12 mos and this is labeled 12-18 mos. It fits him exactly.  Not gonna fit when he's into 18 mos clothing.
"Got this hat in Vegas and I loved it so much I wanted to get one for my mother - we both have small heads!  Happily, I found it on Amazon.
Mom recently had a diagnosis of melanoma cancer on her arm (she's doing fine) so we are very concerned about exposure to the sun.  As fate would have it - I just bought a Fiat Abarth drop top.  I live in Texas.  My dog & I love the top down, so this hat is on my head when I drive.
#1  It stays on my wee noggin.
#2  It's very comfortable because there's no rim in the back.
#3  I get lots of compliments at the grocery store - even from the guy that removed the window tint from my car!
#4  Still holding up after 10 months, much of the time spent floating around in the Fiat with our 64 lb dog and  often wear it while sweating profusely/gardening in Texas."
I like my sandals
Works super well!
These sandals are super comfortable! The color is the same as the picture. I love Teva sandals and these are my first (and definitely not last) pair of Olowahu sandals!
"wow really love this ring, its simple delicate and beautiful, appears to cost much more than what i paid (10$) i sent this to my aunt for mothers day and she loved it, true to size, she is a size 8 for reference we got the clear color stones. going to get one for myself great low cost gift to anyone"
had a cut on side of shoe could not return postage free.
"Completely raincoats, design ergonomic and very well designed! A really good and fine mark.  I used them in days of many rain and beside being raincoats, they support to a perfect temperature the feet. Nice combination of colors."
Nice material. The style is as expected. Very comfortable.
"Love these jeans so much, they fit amazing and you can definitely tell they are good quality. I ordered a 24 and I am usually that or a 0. They make your body look very good but aren't too tight."
My son loves blaze and had one shirt with him on it that he always asks to wear and he doesn't like it when I tell him he can't wear it because it's in the hamper or wash. So I got him this blaze shirt so he has a backup on the days he wants to wear blaze and his first one is dirty.
Great socks...they actually stay up all day......
"Good product. Good price. I pretty much have to purchase jeans online for my 6'6"", 250 lb son.  These work out good for him."
"I bought this for 2 reasons. Style and functionality. I travel, so the ""lay flat"" functionality is a bonus when going through Security at the airport. It has room for everything - and a separate compartment for my laptop and ipad. Style is more subjective - you decide."
Comfortble saddles a little big on my daughter but she will out grow them soon good for beach or to play in the park.
"This is a well made product that does not look cheap at all. It is functional with lots of compartments/pockets, including zippered pockets. It is also nicely packaged with a cloth pouch for storage (it would make a nice gift)."
"I used to get Grasshoppers through Zappos but they don't seem to carry them anymore.  Glad Amazon had them.  You can wear them all day since the they wonderful padding.  Since the have some stretch, you can be sure they will be comfortable."
"My husband LOVES them!!  He will not wear any other brand!  He even has the Dress Shoes!  He wears a 13D, and they always fit well."
These are great comfortable shoes.  It's hard to find shoes in a wide width that are stylish.  Wish more manufacturers would make shoes as cute as these.
"Very comfy, and fit well even as a one size fits all. I am 5'3"" and the length seems fine, not sure they would work for a taller person. These keep my legs warm in 30F and above weather. Only complaint is that the seam in the crotch is coming loose after only wearing a few times. It is a single line running through the middle, from the inside of each leg."
"Fit is perfect, comfortable, look good, great everyday shoe"
Ex gf loved it. Too bad she was a tramp.
"My granddaughter loved the colors of the flowers.  It got an ""Oh Wow!"" when it came out of the bag for try on."
"This Casio watch is a good watch. It is light weight, sort of rugged, and feels pretty good on your wrist.  The main feature is the 10-year battery. Pardon the pun, but, time will tell. Another feature is the glow-in-the-dark hands. I was unaware of the feature when I bought the watch and thought it added a nice touch seeing as I would be wearing this watch while camping.

The cons? Eh, it feels a little cheap and the resin band is a little stiff until you break it in.  I do think this would be a pretty slick watch if it where shock proof as well, but for $17, who cares? It is a pretty classy looking casual watch."
"This is a great suitcase for the price. The purple is a very nice deep purple color. I also recently ordered the 29"" sapphire color and it was also a nice deep shade. The wheels seem to work well. I've take.n the suitcase on two plane trips so far and it is holding up well."
Its great. Feels good. Fit? Yes fits according to size.
I wear a size 9 medium but my heel was hanging off a little bit.  Returning and getting the 9.5
This is a great bra! It is a bit tight but I still did order my usual size. Great multi-use bra!
They're fruit of a loom. Good solid shirts get about 20 wears out of em before you gotta retire em. But for price they'll do
Nice casual jacket - can wear to work or out with a pair of jeans.
good fit well made hat really like the look.great hat for the money
Love it. Fashionable and durable. I pull all over the city with my medical books and laptop. I get tons of compliments
Very comfortable but there is not as much padding on the bottom as I would like.
love  these  sandals wished they would  make more colors.
THANK U
"These are my daughter's favorite pajama pants.  Soft fleece, comfortable fit, and long enough for her long legs."
"Very, very comfortable. Nice and toasty too."
"I bought this shirt for my nephew who became a big brother this year.  He was so excited to surprise his parents when he went to meet his little bother at the hospital wearing the shirt.  He then wanted to wear it every day for the past month to let everyone know he is a big brother.  The green was a nice shade, the only problem was after one use the bottom hem started to come apart and I had to stitch it."
"I love these. I wear a size 7-9 in pants and if my booty wasn't so big these would fit. I can get them on just fine, but they're see through in the bum area. Still so super cute I just wear them as tights. Would recommend for tights or if your smaller they wouldn't show anything. They're good quality besides that and the bows/netting are really sturdy. Just make sure your booty doesn't show through in natural light when you get them."
Beautiful dress. Fits perfectly
"I had Mavi jeans years ago and loved them. Was so happy to find the brand again. These jeans are the most comfortable I've worn in a long time. So soft! But not saggy, even after a whole day."
"It was a little bit too large, but thats the risk by buying clothing in the internet, so I'm pretty satisfied, good job!"
There's not you 100% greatest shoe  but for the price they're cute I would 100% absolutely at bare minimum go up a half size I should have gone to a full size instead of a half up but I'll be able to stretch them to fit.
"After reading all the reviews, I wasn't sure I was going to purchase this, but was running low on time for a Jungle-themed party, so since it was so inexpensive, decided to go for it. I am SO HAPPY I DID!!!

I ordered a large and it was PERFECT!!
I'm 5'3"", a muscular 130 pounds.
Bust: 38 Waist: 26.5 Hips: 36.5

I adored the sexy, primitive cut of the costume, the soft fabric and just loved the glitter!!!  It's like magic Tinkerbell dust everywhere you go!! I didn't think glitter was too much at all.  Waist of the skirt fit perfectly which is important when baring your tummy. Not too tight- not too loose-shows off all that hard work you've been doing at gym or studio. I danced vigorously for hours- but you do have to make sure the skirt doesn't ride up too high since it's very short to begin with.

I didn't care for the ""one-shoulder top"" style, so I tucked the other side into the bodice and just made it a sleeveless top on both sides. I prefer a symmetrical look.
I didn't take a star off for that because A) it's s personal choice and B) the fit, fabric and price made it a ridiculously good deal.

I bought some owl feather arm bands for both arms and wore them on my biceps.
I made a leopard fabric choker necklace with a red heart in the center.

I got compliments all night long and lots of requests to take pics with me-men, women,even people I didn't know!! It was so much fun-very pleased with this purchase!!"
Very comfortable! Soft material. I love it! I am buying more!
Is a nice shirt the material is pretty good.
I love these shoes. Classic style. Comfortable to wear. Dress them up or down these are my favorite go to shoes.
"Love this shirt. I'm plus sized and was surprised andskeptical to find this in larger sizes,not to mention from China where everyone is tiny and petite. I actually forgot I ever ordered it because it took around 20 days to arrive, as they noted. I opened the package and got really excited. The sleeves are semi dolman sleeved...Not as full. Only the underarm area is very full, then the sleeves taper. The fabric is a thin, smooth and silky poly. It layers well. I ordered a size up and it is quite generous. I am 5'4 and the sleeves are a little too long and the body covers my butt. Due to the silky fabric though, it is not bulky and it moves nicely. It would be a great tunic with leggings or skinny jeans. Also, as another mentioned, to sleep in. Very happy with this quality shirt. It is totally cute and as pictured. Get your regular size."
"400 g thinsulate plus wool, can't ask for anything more comfortable and warm. They run a bit on the big size. The mitten choice is fabulous!"
Perfect fit and great color.
I had to reorder this coat in a smaller size and now it fits perfectly.  For some reason the price went up $20 on every size when I went back to reorder the second time.  I would advise everyone to pay attention to the size difference between the UK and the USA.  The coat is well made and looks great.  I was truly surprised how fast it shipped from the UK.  I got the coat in 3 days.  Awesome!!!!
Good price for the amount. Better then the stores.
"Cool leather wallet. Got it for an 8 year old. Exactly as pictured ""the worn look"". Comes with a Marvel gift box. Kind of rough around the edges. I do not believe the seams will last. But you get what you pay for. arrived as scheduled basic packing."
"this is a good quality T the arms hug a little bit for a XL but if that's the look your going for its not a problem, other than that i am very pleased with my purchase. the order came on time no complaints here."
"Love the pants, didn't fit. Contacted the seller and they were so awesome and worked with me. I would difinitely recommend seller and purchase from them in the future"
I went by the chart and the sweater fit as expected. It is well made and lightweight. I love the contrasting buttons.
They were a gift for my nieces daughter my niece likes them.
"It was great. It filled the bill, until I saw the gold plated one, but you couldn't help that. I wish you would would make more Tungsten jewelry. I love them. Especially now that gold and silver is priced so high. Thank you"
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! The color is perfect & the fit is amazing!! I listen to the reviews & went up a size. I am 5'8, a size 16, 38DDD bust and went with XXL."
Really nice shirt and my grandson just loves it!
Toes are a bit touchy but awesome to slip on in the winter.
Very pretty. Nice little scarf for $10.
Great product may order again.
I bought this for my dad for christmas and he really loves it the quality is great and the plating hasn't faded or tarnished and he's had it for about 6 months now and he wears it pretty frequent. It also comes with a lifetime guarantee which I thought was nice. You won't regret buying this ring.
So glad I found these shoes for my Grandson! Just what he was looking for!
Ring is very attractive and very comfortable to wear. Am very happy with it.
Simple amazing sunglasses.
"I'm 5'1 and usually wear a medium/sz 9.  I ordered a large.  The bottom is a teensy bit more snug than what's shown on the model, but I like that so much better.  I think I could've gotten away with a medium too, but I like that the large is nice and roomy.  Good for snuggling up in in the winter.  The black material is like a thin soft sweater, but the screen print of the skull design is really rough and plasticy feeling.  I want to say laminated table cloth.  Also, it's a lot more white than what it shows in the picture.  I don't mind it too much.  And last night it was actually a good thing that the design was so plasticy because I accidentally splattered tomato sauce on it and it mostly repelled the mess.  The other slightly annoying thing, this shirt holds static cling a lot.  It stuck to my back for a good part of the day, whereas nothing else I own has been doing that in this cold weather.

Aside from those minor things, I would definitely buy this shirt in other designs if I found them."
"I love them, well made!"
"Perfect size and love the color, I can't say weather it is tarnish free as I have only just worn it a few times, but I'm hoping for the best!"
This shirt is really nice. I love the material. It is soft but a bit see through. Not that much though. I really like it but the shirt is not as long as it looks on the woman in the picture. It is a little below my waist which covers my stomach but not my butt. I thought it was going to look like the woman in the picture but it doesn't and that is fine because it is overall a really nice shirt. The armpit area is large and if you lift your arm up or try to reach for something you will show bra and skin. I would wear an undershirt if possible to avoid showing this stuff. I am normally a large but buy my shirts larger so they fit comfortable and not too tight. I bought it bigger and it was still too short and not like the woman in the picture long. I hope this helps. Overall I would buy this shirt again. You probably won't get the look like the woman in the picture but it is still a good looking and comfortable shirt. It is really that nice and it also washes well inside out. I would not recommend to dry the shirt.
I love these top I will order more in different color I wear it under my suite for work love them
"Cozy! Live in Florida but it has been in the 40's and I wore it all day outside! I love it! Buying another. Bought the LARGE I am 5'3"" 145, it fits on the baggy side but comfy! A bit long but i just roll it up and it looks really cute! Buying a burgundy one today!"
Beautiful ring! Runs small but totally worth the price for the blingfactor!
"wonderful quality, good price, extremely well-organized"
I was excited when I opened the box.  The material felt great.  The padding seamed perfect.  I attempted to try it on but the back closure wouldn't clasp.  I bought the wrong size. I learned that I needed an extra size up when I tried some on in the store.  If I bought the right size I think it would've been a great bra.
Cute and nice quality but were larger than I thought.
"Nice looking, easy to read timepiece.  Not too huge for a lady to wear, either.
Great watch- great price!  Blue border on crystal is a nice touch."
I bought this a while ago now and this Cross has still not even the slightest tarnished or faded in any way .. and I wear it 24/7  I could not be more happy with this product especially for the super low price..
"I bought these as a boat shoe and for hiking.  It looks nice, dries really fast and provides support.  I am usually a 9.5 and these were slightly big on me but not in an uncomfortable way.  I think the 9 would have been too snug.  Much more practical than my Ecco sandals that take a week to dry after getting wet."
bought for a gift and she loved it
These are great however they do fit half size than the rest of my saucony shoes.
"great hat, wonderful seller!"
