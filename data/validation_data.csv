"Not as satisfied with this bag.  It rips very easily in the seams.  I can see that I will only use this for one season, and have to toss.  I won't even be able to donate it."
These look really cute in the picture but not in person. They are enormous!!!! At least 2 sizes to big. I purchased the brown  and white ones and have to return both pair.
"I normally wear a size 14 and these were way to small.
I bought the 12-18
Needless to say I was very disappointed bcuz i love my tanks!"
I have returned this dress.girls. Listen to me. Don't buy this one. Otherwise u will regrat. Bad quality. Cheap looking. I got better many time one from tjmaxx.
"UPDATE: after 10 months and probably only 100 uses maximum (sunny CA after all), it has terminally failed. Button would not close and nothing worked. I am leery of ALL auto-opening umbrellas now. Two failures out of 2. The manual types never failed in this manner, giving years of service though I absolutely prefer automatic opening type.

_______________________________________
I love these compact self-opening umbrellas. But my first one (another brand NOT this one!) broke.
This model has all the functionality I like and is distinctly more heavy-duty and better constructed than my first (good quality) umbrella.
It is so solid that it inspires confidence. I have barely used it but I am so impressed with the look and feel of it that I am happy to recommend it."
Over rated..not worth the cost..returned
"OK socks but definitely NOT extended size or BG and Tall.  I am a woman who wears a size 9 shoe and was looking to find a sock that actually fit me.  Not these.
This is the 2nd or 3rd Hanes I've bought in the past year hoping something would fit.  No more.  Good bye Hanes.
Sandi B.  ."
"Sent them back, too small and cheaply made.  Elastic waistband stitches raveled right out of package."
"Mi bad, I ordered 3XL Tall but when I tried it is very very big !!!
Is there something I can do to solve this ???
My jacket is at my country Uruguay South America right now
Please tell me how can I change it for a smaller one ...
Shipping costs?
Best Regards

Uruguay"
picture is misleading. It's hard to even put these on because of sharp peices all the way up the legs.
It is nice but it's  too small
"Cheaply made.  Fell apart the first week I wore it.  Personally, it appeared to have used the cheapest parts available, throughout.
I would NOT recommend this product"
When I received this wig I was very disappointed because in the picture it looks like a good quality wig.  I'm ashamed to wear it!
Clasp doesn't work properly
These slippers are garbage. They fell apart 2 months after I bought them and here a year later they are headed for the landfill. Save your $ and buy something else unless you have money to throw away!
"Do not buy!  These pants have a chemical odor that WILL NOT come out.  I have laundered them 5 times in soap, vinegar, fabric softener and the smell still remains.  Not to mention they faded BADLY.  I soaked them in a bucket to get the smell out at first, and the water was black as coal.  It stained my hands so badly that it took bleach cleanser to remove it.  I guess I will toss them, because the smell will NOT leave.  I have hung them outside and still the smell stays.  DO NOT BUY THESE!"
Wrist was too large so it doesn't sit pretty on your arm unless you hold your hand up in the air..
"Was super ribbed, really tight but not in the right places, and wasn't comfortable to wear"
"same as the other review
the fit stinks. no shape. the stretchy fabric feels awful next to my skin. i have a curvy shape, these things are like 2 pieces of straight flat awful stretchy material sewn together by a troll. i threw them out, i wore them a couple of times so i couldn't return them. theyare at the landfill now."
"I thought Satin was Satin. I was uncomfortable and hot in this nightshirt. I looked at the tag and it was Polyester! I Googled Satin and found out that ""Satin"" was more of a feeling, than a material. Sometime Satin is made from cotton and I would definitely have preferred a nightshirt from cotton. Also, after wearing it I found it tight in the chest. I'm very small and it should not have been at all. I will check the description of the material more thoroughly with my next purchase."
"This is cute & fits nicely... BUT... and I mean a HUGE but... my house is covered in yellow fuzz! I washed it according to manufacturers recommendation, and now my entire house looks like Big Bird had a panic attack!"
"I ordered 2 of these hats and had to return them because they were very fitted to my head and the material was thin, not warm at all."
"The shirt is comfortable and fits well, and truly doesn't retain smell -when dry - but sweat a little or splash some water on yourself and you'll have a nasty sheepy smell the rest of the day.

It also wicks sweat right away from the armpit and puddles it on your shirt... But the skin is dry! Moisture wicking is a little too effective.

This is my only experience with merino wool and I'm not super impressed"
"One pack came opened.  They shipped separately and they are extremely flimsy,  more than expected. Never again"
Its not even the item shown in the photo.
"The way these are designed, the toe rides up to hit the patented leather strip when I walk,  making it too uncomfortable to walk in so I'm returning them.  They are very nice looking and well made otherwise and I wish I could keep them."
"I read that I should size up, but in a size larger than my usual size these were far too big.  I didn't like the way the pockets looked on my read end, and the straight fit wasn't flattering at the ankles."
terrible joints and it scratches the glass when you fold the glasses away.
"These boots are the exact color and style I was looking for, fit perfectly and felt very comfortable. Unfortunately, they have a mildew odor that will not go away - even after employing several methods recommended to me by leather experts. I'm stuck with cute, comfy boots I'll never be able to wear. I have had no problem with my other pair of Naturalizer boots, so I highly doubt the brand is the problem."
The shirt sags in the front like a kangaroo pouch. Looks awful.
"Hideous, just a shiny fabric skirt.  Nothing faux leather about it."
Too small across chest and rib cage. Kid of short wasted. I had to return.
You really can see right through these. Wasn't my thing.
I really like this suit but I am top heavy and the top does not fit at all. I ordered a size larger and it still won't fit. 
Do not buy. Their cotton is the worst. You use them first time and they look like an old t-shirt.
"I returned it the same day i received it! My coworker loves turtles and it was to be a gift but it is so tiny, almost for a baby that it would not work. Maybe the detail could be better and to see it on a hand would help to termin the size."
Don't fit like my usual 32s...
I sent them back!
"These socks must have a lot of spandex because the tops are very stretchy.  After wearing them for an hour I have deep grooves pressed into my calves -- not just the very top, but the ribbing down the side as well.  I am not a big person, either.  On the plus side, these suckers aren't going to slide down.  On the minus side, I can't wait to take them off because my ankles are itchy and hot."
"at first looked nice,felt nice, but ,in not much time at all the heel fell off. I would not recommend this shoe
e"
Fabric was really thin and the seams were messy.  The color (blue) is only in the hood.  Clasp comes separate and was broken (I glued it back together).  I ordered one off eBay that was so much nicer and was approximately the same price.
One shoe was noticeably larger than the other but I kept them anyway after I filled the large gap with an insert. I hope it works as they are cute.
"Beautiful Coat but, made way too small. Ordered for an adult but, will only fit a child."
"These are really cheap costuming gloves. They suit their purpose, but they're made of cheap halloween material."
Not a good purchase
Got these in white and black. They shipped together so the black pu came off on the white pair. Cant wear the white pair and the black pair looks shiny and ridiculous.
"Perfect example of getting what you pay for. Although the concept of 8 pieces is a good idea, the quality was poor. Threads were sticking out and fabric was fraying."
The sides around the ankle were very short.  Compared to vans this was not in its league.
"These are very cute shoes. The sole is comfortable but as soon as I start walking they hurt between my toes. I am used to flip flops but the thong for this shoe is to stiff and wide. I am going to try my best to soften them, maybe even alter them a bit because they are so cute."
"The sole is peeling off as I write this review, POOR Quality! I always buy Sketchers,this is the first pair of bad shoes I have purchased."
This would not be a coat to wear to keep you warm.  There was no insulation or lining whatsoever.  The fit was off and it did not look as cute as in the photo.  Would not recommend.  Returned it the same day.
shoe has a wierd cut in toe area...good if you are a narrow but medium feet they are too narrow---tried to return company wanted me to pay shipping so sold locally---will not buy from this company again
Cheaply made and large size might fit a baby
"The left shoe fit fine, but the right shoe was tight. They seemed to stretch more through the day, then ended up slipping off my feet.

Theyre super cute and I wish I could love them. They were painful by the end of the night. This is the last time I will buy shoes online."
"Meh. This was an impulse buy because I always am on the lookout for cheaper supportive bras, but this was a POS and there was no, how do you say, roundness to the (underwire-less)booby section, it was all triangles....that's not how my lady lumps are shaped. We are not Madonna in the late 80's, girls..."
The tongue is attatched so the opening to get your foot in is like putting on a slipper. Too small for my husband and he has small ankles.
Its not as pretty as the picture
"These are the worst excuse for a water shoe ever. When worn to and around the pool, they were like walking on ice! They are beyond slippery and yes, I fell. When on the beach and touched with any water, they filled immediately with sand which then felt like walking in wet cement. The sand went ALL the way under the insoles and also caused them to rub on the ankles and caused a blister. Very hard to rinse out as there was an extreme amount of sand up in the toe area. I was very disappointed!!"
"Didn't like these. They were perfectly functional, but I was not impressed with the paint on them. I was looking for a glossy finish. Great price, good color selection, not the quality I was looking for. Granted these are very inexpensive, I understand that. I did find one tie clip elsewhere for $8 and the finish was a mirror-like finish which what I was looking for. If that doesn't bother you, then maybe these are for you."
used it once for a Halloween outfit....too much to pay for such a cheaply made and cheap looking product
"Runs SUPER small. Order large for my 9 year old, hoping he'd be able to grow into it. IT barely covers his butt and he won't be able to wear it for very long. He loves the color and the hood."
"my favorite shoe keen timmons, with the wide toebox, has been discontinued and replaced with this run of the mill substitute with a narrow toebox.  Now keen doesn't carry any wide-toebox casual shoes.  They have sold their soul to the style-before-comfort mantra of the sheeple shoe industry."
"I have worn these Acorn Rag Wool Slippers for years.  I wanted to be prepared for next winter as my current pair of Acorn Slippers is finally wearing out on the inside sole.
The replacement pair was the right length on my foot, but the right sock top was way too tight.  Barely could get it on over my ankle. The left sock top was the perfect width even though that is my largest leg width. Other reviewers had the same problems, so obviously quality control is lacking."
Beautiful. .but it's plastic?
"The material was too thin and clingy for me.  I will keep it,  but wear it as a house dress only."
They were pretty but too small. I purchased these in two sizes due to the reviews and both pair were too small. Very disappointed.
"Bought these after searching for a pair of sneakers that I liked design-wise. Loved the color, the zebra, and the glow in the dark parts. Out of the box, they were a bit narrow. I decided to wear them in and see. Never any relief. I wore them inside a kickboxing studio for about a month and a half of training 3 times a week - never outside - and I looked last night before class and the soles of the shoes are coming off! My last pair of reeboks lasted over a year and are still good but I wanted a change. Never EVER buying this brand again! Waste of money!"
These where absolute garbage they hardly even stuck and feel complete off.
this is really a pretty shoe... wish the quality was as nice as the appearance... 1st - there is no arch support... feels like you are walking bare foot. 2nd - the picture makes the shoe looks like it has a good sole..... this is more like a foam based sole and the shoe bends completely in half... this does not provide for good foot support. 3rd... this shoe is very loud when you walk.... and slippery... the best way i can describe it is to compare it to walking on sand that has been poured on tile. so very slippery and you get that loud sound.... don't know how to describe it better...4th - i can feel every pebble i step on.....i just can't do these shoes
"whether it is the pleated design or what, but the shoe is too narrow and too short. Am disappointed as Merrell shoes are always my brand of choice."
"I purchased this item in small as it is EXACTLY the size worn in all other clothing. This was SO TIGHT you could barely get it fully on. In fact, we couldn't without damaging so had to return to Amazon. Buy a size MUCH larger then you need. Believe me, you'll be glad!  Also, VERY inexpensively made so expect one use."
This is a nice shirt.  I did not keep it because the sleeves were a little longer than I like.  That is the only reason it was returned.
"These bras are advertised as super comfortable, but they are not made for larger bust lines.  They are too flimsy to support, and are clearly meant to be worn by women with smaller busts as the material--even in XL--does not cover a bust more than a 36B."
The show is too narrow and I have a wide width would suggest a bigger size maybe 1/2 more
These were narrower than the 4 previous pairs that my husband has owned. We returned them. Be sure they are returnable if you try them.
"I'll put it this way--if I hadn't had an extra pair (2) from the packaging, I would have been left stranded the morning of a destination wedding. Despite how large these are on me, and my special care not to snag or catch the pantyhose fibers, the first pair ripped within minutes of putting them (ever-so-carefully) on and standing around doing essentially nothing. It was like they tore without provocation."
"The color is off, and the fabric is horrible"
Cute watch but both watches I purchased broke within the first week of wearing them. The metal bar that connected the band to the watch head keeps popping out on both watches. Its too bad because my 5 and 7 year old loved them but no longer can wear them because they are very hard to put back together especially when they keep popping out.
This was Wack.
Does not give a nice rounded shape as pictured.  It actually flattens your breasts in the front and pushes your nipples out toward your armpits.  It looks awful and is very unflattering.
These have a weird curve to the sole of the shoe that causes a suction like action causing the shoe to stick to any flat smooth surface. I've tripped a number of times in them due to this problem. It's the weirdest thing I've ever had happen. Disappointed for sure as they are cute and fit great. Just can't wear them without looking like a klutz!
When I got the shortages were scuffed up and looked cheaply made.  They didn't fit well. I sent them back.
Returned granddaughter did not like the way it fit her.
"These shoes are cute, but I don't know how long they'll last. It's now 8:18AM, I put them on at 7:25AM, curled my hair, drove to work and I want to throw them away. I could have cut out cardboard, taped it together, sprinkled some glitter and made a comparable product. The bottoms of my feet are burning and I've walked in them minimally (again, had them on for less than 1 hour). I can feel the shoe rubbing the back of my left heel, assuredly a blister is forthcoming. I needed grey shoes and I got grey foot wraps with a thin cardboard bottom. Guess that's the chance you take buying shoes online. If you don't need to walk, ever, these shoes will be perfect."
Rides down - would not wear - if you can wear this you do not need to wear this
"Cute shoe. Seemed comfy at first, but I wore them around the house for about an hour and they got positively sloppy on my foot. The heel is very wide and they do fit at least a half size too large. Not so good in the arch support department. I returned them."
These shoes are poorly made and with cheap materials. The front tab doesn't cover the Velcro strip unless there is NO foot in it( well a foot drawn on paper would fit). I don't know if it's a design flaw or a fluke in just this pair but I wouldn't buy again. We just got done traveling and I had ordered these for my husband for that purpose. I quickly purchased a pair at a local store since these would not work. I just found out I'm a day late and cannot get a refund or exchange. This is really to bad and my fault as I should have taken care of this right away. I had to pick 1-5 stars to review so the star is only for this reason. The material was also very low quality so I wouldn't advise buying these even if your foot is paper thin!
I ordered 2 of these rings. 1 size 13 and 1 size 14 to make sure which one fit. Only got 1 ring in and it said both were delivered.
"althought is a nice bottom, it runs small. Maybe you need to consider a size up.
i think is way too expensive. not worth the money.
i didn't return it as the additional cost of sending it back plus the repayment for the tax would cost me double.
i just wasted my money. shame"
Too big for a large
Did not fit at all.....was very disappointed
"Ugly shoes. They fit ok, but are heavy and not suitable for me."
"Runs way too small for a ""1X Plus Size"". I normally wear a 16, 40D bra and it was tight across my chest. Also, the front has a gap between the buttons, so there's no overlap or tab there. You'll have a 1/2"" gap all the way down the front, so be sure to plan for a T-shirt or something to layer underneath."
this was for my wife which did not like that the toe was right up to the shoe and she felt as though the toe would start to rub on the shoe and create a problem
This was the worst purchase I've ever made.  It too forever to receive this item and then once it was received it was sized for a child not an adult!
"Capezio used to be a dependable dance shoe brand. My experience in the last 2 years has been disastrous. My last pair of Fierce wore out after less than 6 months of 3 hours of dance per week, no outdoor exposure. Called Capezio, they recommended the Rockit - those actually fell apart at the seams after 3 months. Called again this time & they assured me the Bolt was an 'improved' model. Not so - cheaply made, poor fit (I have worn the same size for 25 years & these are off sized although once again I inquired when I called), no support and just awful."
Top too small.  How do I exchange.
"I love the look of these boots and was really disappointed when I couldn't even get my foot inside them comfortably. I do not have unusually high arches but these boots are so narrow between the sole and the seam that runs across the top of the foot at the arch it's downright painful. I tried shoving a tennis ball and a can of soup in them to try and stretch it to no avail. Even with the thinnest of socks there was no way this would be comfortable. If I had to put any kind of arch support or orthotic in these shoes I doubt I could get more than just my toes through the arch seam. Doc's really needs to reconsider this design. The length of the shoes is true to size, they just need more space between the arch and the sole."
"Item is for one time use, Velcro sticks to material and causes it to fray easily."
"Recieved these but the waist band was black not white. I wanted just what the picture showed. My department store did not have my size in this style,so I ordered them on line. Advertisment picture is not accurate to the product recieved."
"They advertise as polarized, they are NOT. That was the reason I ordered them. Unless you don't care what you get don't order."
What a heap of crap!! The rings were so tiny it barely pasted my nails. Tiny tin and a heap of crap!! It's not even worth sending back because it came from CHINA! Never again! It's not even silver!
The leggings I received smelled like bug spray and/or industrial chemicals!! I washed them twice and all it did was stink up our laundry room and made the leggings look two years old when I only had them a few days and never worn them as the chemical smell has never gone away!!  Which was such a shame as they looked comfy yet not very good quality. Contacted the seller and they refunded me thankfully!!
It's waaaaaay too short and I even got a size up from my usual. The straps are a completely different shade of black from the skirt and the zipper came broken. Pretty bummed because I was super excited about this skirt.
"Decent looking shirt when ironed, but it will wear your iron out!  The shirt came wrinkled throughout, especially around the buttons.  The two strips where the buttons and the button holes are get wrinkled in the wash/dryer so badly that it takes forever to get them out.  This is after a single wear and wash after ironing before wearing.

I can't really recommend this shirt.  Again it LOOKS nice but it takes too much work to get to that point.

-D"
I use them for shower/beach shoes. The design and colorway on these are really sleek. The shoe start coming apart and I only use them in the shower. Very poor quality
"It was a lot smaller than I thought and it was very poorly made. I ordered a small and a medium. Oddly enough, the medium size was too small and the small fit better. However, it still didn't fit well because the hemming was so crooked. The price is low but there are other swim suits with low prices that are of better quality. I would definitely not recommend this swimsuit."
Too big.  I should have read better.  Wanted something like a book bag size.  Loved the way it looked when I ordered it.
"Poorly made, buttons come off easily. Couldn't returned because, maker doesn't except returns once, washed. Very disappointed"
"After reading many reviews I decided to buy this pair of glasses. I was very worried about the folding arms scratching the lenses. I should have been more worried about the real problem, which was the arms scratching each other when folded. I was very careful with these glasses, but the design is flawed and scratches happened anyway. Black frames show flaws the most and I was very unhappy with this purchase. It might not be as big of a deal visually with a different colored frame. If you are picky and like things to stay immaculate stay away from these."
"Looks like an old lady dress. The print is cool though, so I'm keeping it to make into something more flattering."
Crap. Costumey. Better off getting something like this off wish or somewhere you pay as little as what you get.
"WAY too small. My daughter is barely even in a 4, which is what I ordered for her, and this barely covers her rear end. I let her wear it anyway with some leggings and within the first hour 3 of the buttons or button covers had popped off."
These do not stay up above my knees for more than a few minutes. 5'6 and 140lbs.
Kept slipping off  :(
"This is ok.  It would be much better if the basket looked like a basket.  Take a look at the pictures other customers have posted.  That is what you're going to get.

The seller should change their picture.  It's false advertising."
"Cheaply made. I ruined one pair by trying to take off the plastic attachment between L and R. I found them fluffy before washing, limp afterward. Wear these type houseshoes all the time and these are the poorest quality I've ever bought."
To small and traded it for some older large luggage. Not even wide enough for a shirt
Ordered an XL but must have been Chinese XL. I couldn't fit into it. Way too small. I gave it to my daughter who fit it fine
"Got size medium, not wanting anything too tight as I'm muscular with broad shoulders and bigger chest.  The length is fine, the sleeves are fine, but the shirt fits like a tent!  If you have a huge stomach this shirt is for you."
Very stiff and too narrow at the toes. I wear and 7.5 and got a size 8.
Even at a newborn size it was to big for our little girl.
"Arrived in a very very small package, way too short (I'm 5'7"") and it came half way up my calf. Extremely thin cheap fabric."
Length is true to size but strap across instep is too long so foot slips around.
I ordered a 1X jacket and it looks like a 3X. I can't use it by any chance!
too large for large
"Like Vionics and a 7 usually fit perfect, but these as too large."
this was very disapointing i bought this as a gift for my son fro his birthday as he is a collector of watches first when it arrived the outer material was pealing a little thought okay this is a quick fix then i gave it to him and when he put his watches in it  it fell apart wanting to return it but it would have cost me twice as much. very disapointing
"I am so disappointed that these didn't work out. I originally ordered my usual size 8. They ended up being too tight which I equate to postpartum body changes. So I returned them and ordered an 8 1/2 thinking that would be perfect. There is no way these are an 8 1/2, they're huge, at least a whole size bigger. I even measured my feet and though I measure closer to a 9, the 8 1/2 is still way too big. It's like they skipped right over the half size.
On top of that the box arrived crushed which in turn crushed the shoes (see pictures). If these fit I probably would have just dealt with the damage but since they don't, it only makes it worse.
I'm so so disappointed. The style of these shoes is amazing and they seemed comfortable enough to wear for an extended amount of time. The leather is decent quality and they seemed durable. I will probably purchase this brand again but will be very weary of the sizing."
"The description for this costume states one size fits most adults with an additional description on the package ""fits up to size 12"". I'm 5'7' and typically wear a size 4 - the dress is not only shorter in real life than in the picture, but is actually more of a shirt."
"i recommend to buy this belt in 2 size bigger, my waist is 32 and the belt runs small as expected.."
Shirt was smaller than expected and it had an odor.
Nice selection. Some broke and they replaced them quickly. All of the will turn your toes black from tarnish.
Arrived with multiple rips and stains. I did JT even bother bringing it with me to the desert.
"Cheap material, weird fit, took forever to get to my house. I gave it to Goodwill right away."
my high instep on my left feet would not fit  it hurt so I decide to had to return them.
i t would've been a hot sexy number for my hubby to rip off of me but it was too snug and i took it off for him.
Different colors than were shown in picture.  One tank has already torn across the shoulder after being worn twice.  Will not buy again.
There to BIG they hang out my bra
"I ordered these shoes, and they looked perfect, were packaged nicely and were the perfect height for what I wanted.  The toe area is very wide, so unless you wear wider than a medium width you are out of luck.  Returning these to the mfg also seems to be a difficult process unlike most of Amazon return policies."
The material is thin and run smaller than most of other spans item
Not enough room for me in the crotch and thighs.  NB: I'm African-American.
Material feels inexpensive.  Fit is real small.  Not the quality I expect from NYDJ.  Their pants are great.  This top is not.
"I was very disappointed with these boots,as was my husband. These were purchased to replace another pair that I purchased as a Christmas gift. These are very narrow,he could not even get his foot into them,and that is with the zipper all the way down. I have to say also,having made great quality shoes myself,these are very stiff leather,and poor quality. I cannot ""recommend"" these boots.:-("
These glasses make it look like you have big white eyebrows.
Disappointed.  Own several other Alex and Ani bracelets.  This is very thin and somewhat flimsy and over all too delicate for my personal style.
This is the 3rd order of ASICS Ive ordered online that don't fit! Now its past my 30 return window & I cant even send them back for a refund  I wear a 8.5 & a 9 doesnt even fit!
While it looks ok in pictures in reality it doesn't look that good and the band is terrible.  I wore it one time and may wear it again just to wear something different but it is not something I would look forward to wear.
I read the reviews. Yes it falls apart. But when you are wearing it to a new year rave who cares. It's for a one time use.
"don't know what adult female can wear this, it literally looks like doll clothes"
"Quality Not as they appear ..I'm very disappointed in these scarves, I ordered 5 in different colors for Xmas presents & I have to pay return postage on the ones not shipped from amazon"
Very thin like a large t shirt
"This lingerie is loose fitting in the front; more suitable for a pregnant woman.
Everything else is as expected."
The wig is very pretty and vibrant red. I could kind of maneuver the hair around to suit my style and the curls are a nice touch. I wish I could give more stars but this wig is pretty short. If it was a blonde wig I would look like Goldie-locks. I did not anticipate on paying for a wig that was so short. It's above my collar bone. Not to happy about that.
Looks like they are left feet!
"These shirts are not made with the mini-waffle weave I look for in a summer shirt. Their weave is wider  and will let a little light in. They don,'t look as well made as other waffle-knit shirts I have seen."
Had to return these shoes. Were not a good fit for me
Does not run true to size. Had to donate them.
"Two stars for length, the large tall fit well in that department for me (6'5"").
However, the neck is very tight, and the sleeves are very loose. I'm 235lbs in decent shape, but wearing this shirt makes me feel like Skinny Arms Mcfat Neck.
And the neck is tight enough for constant discomfort throughout my workout."
"Was disappointed with the quality of this bag. The canvas feels very cheap and plastic-y. It's not like the canvas JanSport bag I've had for many years. Not sure if it's cheaper for kids, but I wasn't expecting the plastic feel."
Already fell apart...
I bought a size 8 ivory and it was nice and curvy but my shoulders were too large and did not fit. The beading also looks cheap.
They run really really big... My son is a size 6 n I bought the 7-8 size thing I'd give room for his feet to relax since they're slippers but guess what I don't think it would fit till he's almost a size 9 or 10.
"I didn't really care for these.  I suppose for some people they are a good idea, but they really aren't for me.  They are pretty uncomfortable, and look strange.  I would rather wear low cut socks."
"I was looking for a good lightweight Beach shirt and saw the pictures on Amazon.
It looks and fits nothing like what I saw in the pictures. Even after reading the reviews I upsides the shirt and still it was extremely tight and fit unevenly. In the picture you'll see two slits on both sides of the shirt that looked to be about an inch long.
 In reality those slits go up to my fourth rib...lol
Save your cash fellas... you've been warned"
It fits small and is very thin. Not satisfied with this product.
A total piece of garbage.  The lace is tacky and cheap looking.  The material is limp and unattractive.  Will never use.  What a mistake.
shoes were very wide at the ankle and ran small for a 10.
This boot is very confusing to strap up. There are too many loops and they to not look good at all . I would not recommend this shoe and I am returning mine.
Product was received as expect but unfortunately the heal part of the sneaker came of on the 1 st day if wear it. You get what upay for. Better off buying sneakers from department store then ordering them from Amazon.
Sizes run to small
"Returned, not the comfort I am used to from Marika; maybe just a bad cut/design for me."
It arrived broken. A waste of $2. Do not ever buy!!!
"did like it, not natural enough"
You never know what color you will get!
ran small- had to give them away
The cross strap over your toes is too short.  There is not enough room to get the strap over your foot and be comfortable. Could never have been able to wear.
"It's gets one star because it has a cute pattern and arrived.  Here is where it goes wrong.  First of all it comes from China and takes quite awhile to get here.  Secondly and the worst part is that it smells HORRIBLE.  Like it's really, REALLY old.  I can't get the smell out of it and I've had it airing out for well over a week.  It is SO bad that I can't wear it because the smell gives me a horrible headache.  I'm really disappointed in this.  Although I guess that is why it was so cheap."
"I normally would take a medium in tops, but I saw reviews that said this ran small, so I ordered an extra-large.  I don't really need shaping for my torso, but thought this might be something that I could wear to the gym.

The material is a nice weight with lots of firm stretch.  However, it runs really, really small. I could barely get it on, and then looked like a stuffed sausage. There is no way that this could be an extra large. There is also absolutely no padding or shaping for the bust, so unless you have small breasts, very firm breasts (or implants), you will be squashed into an unflattering shape.

Not recommended!

Edit:  I had my 16-yr-old try this on. She's 5'6"", about 125 lbs, and wears a junior size small.  It was too tight and ""weird and uncomfortable."" I took a picture but unfortunately don't see anywhere to upload it."
"If you are looking for a decent quality corset this probably isn't the choice for you, I picked this for a costume and it worked for of but it ran very small and was the hardest corset I have ever woren to put on and ghe most uncomfortable."
The foot part is somewhat small and the ankle is a bit too big. My lo flings them right off. Not very happy with the purchase.
"Sorry,the color was horrible, very false looking and one of the bracelets (ordered 2) was not flexible ,where the links joined there was not movement One of the bracelets could not be opened Clasp was so tight."
"I was looking forward to this bra taking care of side boob, however, the bottom band edge dug into my rib cage. The cups were also rather large, but the straps were oddly short with the fastener that dug into the side of my arm pit. A rather unpleasant combination, so I had to return it."
"As soon as my daughter pulled up the pants they ripped around the waist band. The color was nice just as the pic, but the material sucked!!! Poorly made."
Hurt my feet. Had to return it.
"I prefer a slightly heavier fabric with a looser fitting shape. This was too thin, too clingy."
"I liked the fit, but the white sides are a bit see-through! I wouldn't want to risk getting it wet! I bought a 10, I'm 5'4"" and 150. I'm hoping that the one with black sides fixes that issue."
It is very cute but very small
"They fit great at frist and then stretched out after wearing them for a few hours. Washing them in hot water and drying them on high heat didn't help the problem. Most jeans  shrint quite a bit, but these didn't so make sure they fit well as they are out of the bag. Sadly I won't be able to wear these"
"This is a lovely skirt, but certainly not one size fits all.  The waist is very tiny, so I took it to a dressmaker, since it was too long for me, also,and I didn't want to cut the border design, to see if she could take out the elastic and cut off  from the waist instead. She said there wasn't enough material and would be much too expensive. Too bad. Pretty design."
One of the bracelets was missing in my order and I had to send it back.
The purse is alright but i don't like the fact that the zipper only zips the center and leaves the ends open and as far as the wallett goes it is terrible and poor quality
"I've owned multiple Rockport shoes over the years. They're comfortable and true to size. The big problem with this particular model is the sizing. They Certainly have it wrong. First pair was too large, the next size down was good lengthwise but extremely narrow . On third pair,  I had to go down one size and order a wide instead of M that I normally wear to get it right. From my personal experience, one may have to go one size down and get a wide  version to be able to fit in ok."
TOO SMALL. MIGHT BE GOOD FOR EYEBROW.
Ripped within the first two weeks. They feel great out of the package but they lack quality.
"I'm 5'6"" and about 140lbs. The waist fit fine, but wouldn't zip around the bust. The dress is incredibly thin and see-through. There is a slip, but it's hardly noticeable: too thin and also too short-barely reaches past the hips. Notice the lace at the bottom. In the picture it looks ok, but on my height where the lace comes up to makes it indecent. If you're shorter, smaller bust and don't mind buying a full slip to wear under it, it's still cute."
This appears to be an imitation timberland. Very cheaply made and fell apart within 4 weeks. Do not buy not worth the money.
"Not very compact. By the time you put your cards and money in all the slots, it's the same size as a normal wallet. This would probably be useful for a purse or backpack, but for a guy trying to downsize and replace a wallet in his pocket? Not a good choice at all."
"It's a cute shoe,  price is right but quality is v poor.  After a couple days of wear the surface finish on the tip of the toe wore off.  Very disappointed."
"The material is great and I love the lace down the back, but it runs EXTREMELY small. My butt was half showing and the materials didn't even touch in front like a robe."
"Started off okay, but after a couple of days, the band separated (It is only glued, not stitched) Returned item and looking for alternative."
"The fit and comfort of this shoe is great... It's the construction I have an issue with.  I wore these to work for one week before the soles began to separate from the boot.  I was surprised because I thought Keen made a quality product.  When I asked coworkers if they had had any issues with Keen in the past, they all said that their boots fell apart fairly quick.  I guess they are not built tough enough for arborist:("
It was a little brighter than I expected and the zippers are not working like they should in fact I all most though they were broken when I first got it if I hadn't have messed with them they wouldn't have worked at all. As it is I can zip one side of it shut all the way without risking it getting stuck.
Not as shown on picture. Small size. Misleading information. Probably will send back.
"Hi,i haven had a chance to try them out unfortunately they are a bit tight,and i have to send them back for a larger pair or a refund...Thank you!"
very small and i received hals sleeves
"Cheap product. Damaged seams and blue thread has been sewn into orange fabric. If I didn't get this shirt for $3, I'd be pissed."
"Just received these, and I am so disappointed.  My son has other Reefs that are size 13/1, and they are almost too big - but he wears them.  I ordered the same size in these and they are significantly smaller - too small.  They are really cute but the fact that they are so much smaller than other reefs is a disappointment."
These are suppose to be men's XL but they look like youth.
Runs very small wish I knew that. Not a hit with my grandson :(
Not very comfortable. To low to the ground. Not enough support.
very poor quality leather strapping and the time is always off.  Doesn't work well as I must constantly adjust the time. It stops every so often. I don't use it anymore
"I guess I'm the lucky one that got used, or returned ones. Obvious wear, and dirty..."
Our baby hated it. He screamed bloody murder every time we put it in him. Disappointed we spent the money.
They look very cheap....they took a long time to arrive and then boom...letdown  I purchased another pair from this seller and those earrings were very nice but thees with the dangle cube with a CZ stone in each one is a mess....not even worth returning.
"While I love other products from this company, this purse just slides around too much. I would recommend some sort of stoppers on the bottom. This was my least favorite purchase from this company. Everything else was great I ordered though."
The necklace is always tangled where the squares are. And its really hard to untangle it.
"The right moccasin width is is 1/4 inch less than the left moccasin. This causes your foot to scrape against the woven strap inside, very painful. For the money paid you would think they would be assembled by someone who could actually read a tape measure correctly. Purchase at your own risk."
Shoe looks very pretty order a half size larger THEY RUN SMALL I WEAR A 9 BOUGHT A NINE DID NOT FIT
I like this purse at first it feels nice and it looks nice but after about a couple weeks every time i walked in the store it would make the sensors go off like i stole something and this is soo embarassing. I thought well maybe it would stop well two months later it never stopped. I have contacted the seller and they tell me oh well nothing they can do about it and told me to take them MK thing off on the front because it is real GOLD and makes the sensors so off LOL not real GOLD so that was funny to me anyways so i tried that still goes off. I have searched the bag and no tags or anything so i do not know why this is happening but so disappointing to spend this much on a purse that i cannot use.

"The shoe has very little, if any, arch support and is a loose fit. I like Clarks shoes but this style of shoe was a disappointment."
The wallet is very tight just with a few credit cards.  The leather is fake.  Some of the red color is coming off along the edges and I've only used it for a few weeks.
Got this for my elderly Mom's elderly husband. One size does not fit all. If you know they are large go to 1x or more.
Poorly stitched and sides are not even.
"They're comfy and looks good. Nice casual, for going out or shopping."
Very disappointed with how much I spent I can wear them for about 2 hours and they hurt my feet so bad I have bring extra shoes to change into
I like the quality of the bra but the cup sizing is so off. The band size was a true fit but the cup was about 2 cups off.
Your foot slides in these
I bought a large and it is extremely small. You get what you pay for.
"I always buy XLT polos, I won't buy this brand again. The sleeves go a couple of inches below my elbow, very uncomfortable."
"runs a bit large, and a bit wide. other than that they are comfortable, they could use a good insole. they are very light for a safety toe boot. well see how they hold up. id order a 1/2 size smaller than normal if i were to order again.

*2 month update. the boots are garbage. the leather has ripped from normal use. for the price these should last a bit longer. Reebok should be ashamed."
"Does not work. Runs slow and therefore never tells the right time. I tried resetting it several times and it always ends up at the wrong time later in the day. I see other reviews say the same thing so I believe this is just a cheap, poorly made watch, not that I received a defective product. I am returning it for refund and buying a different watch. What's the point of a watch if you can't trust that it will be the right time?

I'm giving 2 stars because it is cute and the band is nice and soft. If you just need a prop or fashion statement, this is cute. If you want to tell time, keep shopping.

UPDATE: I bought it again hoping I just had a fluke and the next one would work better. The time piece did work but the strap broke after 4 months of daily wear. Never worn in the shower or got wet. Should have lasted much longer. I'm requesting a refund."
"These hurt between toes, I keep hoping they will be comfortable because everything else about them is fun. They are a bit tight at the place between toes."
Already falling apart after a month.
"After reading reviews other people stated that the boots ran small, so I ordered a half size up. I wear a size 8 and ordered a 8 1/2. They were too big. Tired of shipping products back, so I kept them and decided to wear thicker socks so they would fit better."
"you guys do realize that the character Dorothy is supposed to be a 12 year old little girl...right? this shouldn't have been made sexy. i didn't purchase this, i just seriously wanted to point that out."
Bulky and uncomfortable to wear. A silly watch. (:-((
"Shoe looks great, but totally slips off on the heel to the point they are unwearable. I purchased a pair  in another color directly from Aerosole, but will be returning my unworn pair."
Super cute but took a month to arrive from China and its wayyyyyy too big. Made for Amazonian tall people. Super long. I ordered my normal size and I was swimming in it.
"These really do crumble easily. I should have listened to other reviews. Great deal, but really only get to wear each one once, twice if lucky."
Is Not the best made
"these are tiny, tiny, tiny"
"Poor material, size is too big"
Rip Off . Which is surprising for Amazon.
"You get what you pay for but I definitely didn't expect something that had hot glue strung all over the mask to the point as I took the glue off it messed up mask, all the flair of the mask was loose and falling apart. I fixed it all myself because I don't have time to go out and get a new mask before the event. But I wouldn't buy again."
"Thin, tight"
I am so disappointed. I put the first one on and it was perfect. I pulled the second one on and the size is all jacked up. I am returning these.
"A friend of mine had these boots, and I fell in love. I ordered them without any doubts, knowing I already love Keen. The boots were cut very narrow from the footbed to the calf. I planned on wearing these with skinny jeans, but couldn't zip them over thin leggings! They also had a strange flare towards the top ot the boot, and the bottoms seemed slick too. Once in my posession these were not for me. Ended up with the Shelby high boot, and it's perfect!"
"These are cute and go with a lot of stuff. They do run a bit small, I sized up one size and that did the trick. Unfortunately they cut into my little girls ankles just below her ankle bone and cause a small to moderate amount of bleeding. Happened on both feet. They're also really easy for babies to remove so one second they're there and the next you may be searching the ground for the one (or two) she threw out of the stroller.

Socks may stop them from cutting into her ankles but the style doesn't really lend itself to socks. If the shoes were slightly lower in the back we'd be all set. Unfortunately I think she won't be wearing these again so these didn't end up being a good value for me."
"Fabric is cheap feeling like club wear, and stripes don't match up."
"Honestly, I was very excited for the product BUT! The size XL it looks like a American M. My size is 12 and it didn't fit the way I expect. The fabric is decent. Over all, I'm Frustrated."
"Too small, had to return.  Very cute though."
"Very thin chain.
Broke within the first hour of wearing it."
"The shoes were entirely too small. I typically wear 7.5 or 8 in every shoe, so I ordered these in an 8. My toe was at the very tip with no wiggle room at all and the width was at its max so the shoe strings were too short to tie. I've scheduled a return."
"I think when i first got these they fit just 'right'  a bit snug,  but not too tight.  I think after washing them several times they shrunk a bit and are now very tight on me."
"I ordered the biggest one they had, I'm not that big of a person. I had to give it to my daughter. After a few washes, it looks so dingy. Maybe if you get it dry cleaned it'd still look nice?"
"I bought this bag because it looks pretty cool in the picture.  I figured depending on quality I would either use this for extensive traveling, or just a sack to throw a towel and various things in when I go to the beach or something.  It has proven to only be useful for the latter option.

Pros:
Looks cool in the picture, and my friends thought it looked cool and vintagey in person.

Cons:
Cheap cheap cheeaaaappp.  The main shoulder straps don't feel like they could handle any weight whatsoever.  All the pouches and flaps use a belt buckle style latch to hold them down.  I don't know how else to describe them but as cheap.  Like a belt on a toy soldier I guess.  Nothing would be secure in this bag at all.

The fit.  It fits horribly.  One of the things I like most about my slim profile laptop backpack is that it tends to hug your full back even full of books.  This bag however, feels like you're wearing a plastic shopping bag on your back with your arms through the handholds.

In summary....I'm kicking myself for not returning it out of sheer laziness when I bought it.  I hadn't really used it until months after buying it.  Oh well :P"
I do not find that it supports very well and is very thin material and short and does not totally hide your flaws. I use to buy these at sams club and they were awesome and totally smoothed you out. They give a slight support and feels better than not having it on.
"The straps are too tight.  The material also does not lay smoothly like it shows in the picture.  I ordered my correct size and it 'fits' in the band and cups, but the straps are just not roomy enough.  Red marks from it digging into my shoulders after only having it on for a minute. I have this problem with some bra styles and not others, wish they would all allow for generous strap adjustment.  Very disappointed."
Love the dress and the way it fits except its made so poorly and the material is so cheap that it stretches out after wearing it an hour.
Size 13 shoe and these socks fit too tight.  I will keep them in hopes they stretch.
Too small ! Had to give it to my little sister who's a freshman. I'm normally a small so I was confused how it didn't fit. I'm 5'0 122 32C
"It doesnt look as nice as the picture, and its semi transparent."
My daughter love the shoes but it was the wrong size. It should of been a 3 size. Please help.
Tranished. Quick delivery!
Returned
Too small and too short not a correct 18-20
Arrived defective. Son was devastated!  The charge plug wouldn't accept the charger on one shoe.i expect more from sketchers.returned!!
I wore the belt approximately two dozen times until two of the grommets fell out..!
Ripped at the seams in three different places! Two on the sleeves and one on the shoulder. I am completely  disappointed and angry that I paid to expedite such an inferior product that I'll have to repair myself or send back! What an inconvenience!
"Love it, fits very good.  When I washed it in cold water, the black ran onto the white and made purple.... Can't wear it anymore."
So sad these seem to run narrow and small!  I have worn this style for years but these will have to go back!
Cheap and tacky. Ugh. Not as pictured
Was horrible so small it was for a 10 year old!! Ordered and 1x for a grown man and it fit my 11 year old 80 pound daughter!!!! Very disappointed very upset
"This set of bags was pretty disappointing. They turned out to be smaller than I expected even after looking at the measurement. The quality is not that great either. It feels cheap, and like it will easily rip or break. We ordered several sets and sending them all back."
These have to be seconds. Super stretchy. Big and baggy. Not the correct sizing at all.
Horrible fit and fabric...wide unfashionable legs...ugg
"I am unhappy with this item but threw away the receipt so can't return. OOPS
The decorative slit in the middle of the chest cuts wayy too lowww . . . and the bottom literally ends up at the center of her chest.
Can't wear to school, so this ended up in her dress up clothes collection."
"It doesn't fit. I am not a small person but normally something this size would fit well and even be a little big. I am 5'10"" and 210lbs and wear a DD bra. It looks horrible on me and it doesn't cover my breasts. :("
these straps are a serious pain in the ass and the material is so loose it doesn't hold your boobs at all
"I usually wear a 14 so I ordeted an XL. The bodice was way too big and the waist was too tight. The buttons are purely decorative  snd were mot sren on properly,  making them hang at an odd angle.  I am 5'7"" and the length hit me  just above midcalf.  I returned it."
Top too big
didn't know it was in spanish
"Not crazy about these... larger than size chart attached to item.  Legs have no shape to them.  And they don't have a 33"" inseam either.  I'm thinking about returning them.  They do not look like the photo - they look much cheaper in person.  They are no where near the quality I should  have gotten for the $69 I paid for them (and they were listed as ""the last pair"" when I bought them... now there is magically another ""last pair"" available - for about $8 less than I paid.  I imagine someone else returned a pair."
"It's not actually a shaper/slimmer. It's just a tank top made out of spandex. There are squares stitched around it that are supposed to look like the ones on the more expensive brands but the expensive brands have non stretchy material stitched into the squares to keep the flab in check. These just stretch around the flab. Also, being made of spandex, it doesn't breathe very well. I had it on while watching tv and it was all sweaty after about 10 minutes, so it's probably not great to wear out of the house unless you want to simmer in your own sweat."
sent back too tight
"My older daughter has used this brand for several years, and loves them.  So I decided to try them for my younger daughter.  She chose pink.  Unfortunately, after just one month of use, the upper soles of the flip flops (where feet touch them) have turned black.  They look disgusting!  I have tried every possible cleaning technique I can think of, to no avail.  I was able to lighten the black marks at the heel, but not at the ball or toe area.  I'm very disappointed at how they already look as if she's used them for years.  She doesn't run around outside barefoot, so I'm not even sure how they got such a dirty appearance.  I was never able to tell any problem with the pairs my older daughter has used, but I guess that's because they are black-bottomed and we can't tell.
On the up side, they are super comfortable.  Run a bit wide.  The sparkly straps and pink color were a selling point for my daughter."
SMALLLLLLLLLLL
"I am a standard men's medium in every brand, every department store, and nearly every style, however this wasn't even close to fitting me."
"I could not get a single pin out using this tool.  Each time I tried the little pin broke. I found the instructions on line and Googled how to resize a watch band. I lined up the tool, pushed in direction of the arrow on the band and each time the little tip of the tool bent over then broke. They give you a couple replacement pins and explain they are designed to break to prevent damage to the band, but geez, all of them breaking without getting the first pin out? I am going to try a different tool."
"It would have been nice if it actually fell from the waist like in the picture and not from the hips. I loved the length and the color. The material was a bit thick, I would have probably only worn it in the fall or winter if I had kept it."
They looked great but run at least 1.5 size small.
Chain very cheap and broken link. I had to fix it due to immediate need to use.
This shirt runs extremely small. the xl is the size of a women's medium in US.
this is a cheap shoe but it fits the price. I won't order it again
Great wedge but they are dark brown not grey.
"I placed this order based on the photo. I recently lost my hat and searched for an exact replacement. The product I received is not the one advertised. Is it a hat? Yes. Can you wear it ? Yes, but it's not what I expected."
Wrong Size
"Poor workmanship on these boots. Uneven stitches, etc UGG is not what it used to be."
not sure what it was but just didn't work
"I bought these for house shoes and I was really happy with them, but this morning I wore them around doing chores and the top separated from the bottom on my left shoe. Im so sad cause my Mom has had hers for a year and I just got mine in the mail yesterday. Hers were the brown ones."
Fit like a burlap sack. Not cute.
"I'm really disappointed in these.  I love Born Shoes - this is probably my favorite brand of shoe.  And after just very sporadic wear, these sandals broke.  The thong piece came out and was no longer attached.  It happened while i was walking, too, and I nearly sprained an ankle.

Update:  I spoke with Amazon and since these sandals are out of the return window, there are no refunds or exchanges for this item.  I've never had a problem with the quality of Born shoes before, and these hadn't even been worn frequently (seasonal nature of item)."
"I was sent the wrong socks, I guess. These are Fruit of the Loom but not Plus Size and they are 98% polyester and 2% spandex. I have not tried them on but can tell they would be too snug. The socks advertised were almost half cotton content, these have zero cotton content. I am very disappointed!"
"I did not like the cheap fabric that was used to line the coat pockets. It was like some weird disposable hospital socks or something. I couldn't imagine putting my hands in those pockets every day throughout the winter. I returned it.
However, unlike other plus-sized Columbia items, I did think that this fit true-to-size."
horrble. plastic lens.
"This was a very unflattering dress - it was very large, did not feel like a cotton blend at all and was truly a ""bag"" dress.  The straps would not for the life of me stay on my shoulders (and I have broad shoulders) so this was a total fail for me.  I hope others have better luck because it looks cute in the pictures. NOTE:  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

Update:  Amazon and seller refunded my money with no issues.  thank you!"
Beautiful was to be a gift to my daughter but the stone was too large
UGYLY
I was very disappointed in these socks.  I thought I would be getting cotton socks and these feel more like thin nylon.  Won't be buying them again.
credit card slots too small and thick and heavy and metal parts broke before I even used it.  I would like to return them
"The bag was a bit bigger than a I thought and it started to come apart a little only after a few days. I got the bag for my sister as a birthday present, but returned it after a few days because strings were coming loose. Pretty disappointed."
"May fit a little kid but not a man . Waste of money ,"
"It fits ok, but I can BARELY walk in this!  It's not stretchable material, especially at the knee.  So, when I started walking I could only extend my legs so far to take each step.  I had to take small steps, which felt weird.  I wore this once and ended up buying a different skirt.  This skirt was VERY disappointing, I had high hopes, looking at the pictures.  It's just too tight at the knee and the material is not the adjustable type."
I waited a while to write a review to give myself time to wear these sandals.  I purchased them last winter for vacation in white and I like the details and overall look.  After wearing them this summer for a while I noticed the lining by the thong wearing a hole right through the material.  Then I noticed they were feeling uncomfortable with a bulge under the ball of my foot.  Didn't take much investigating to see the bulge was created by granuales of sand.  After shaking it out of each sandal I had quite a pile of sand.  I don't see how they could be fixed.  Not worth the $50 and hardly the summer season done.
"I wear a medium in every size of underwear I've ever owned. Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein, etc. These fit awfully small despite the sizing chart, which I followed. I'm going to give these to my little cousin."
Not as useful as I needed.
I ordered a size Large for my 5'9 170lbs frame and lets just say I couldn't get the item on my body at all. However; the item is very cute!
"As with the other reviewers I have to say that the sizing of this belt is completely wrong. L/XL usually covers 36-42. I am a 36 waist and I can barely get this thing around my waist, unusable. Gave it to one on my friends who is a 32 waist and it fits him about right.

Has the era of skinny jeans misled people so much that they think 32 waist is an XL?"
"These tights are exactly that - tight - very tight in the hips, can barely get them on, and unbearable to wear. They are being returned. I ordered one size larger than I normally wear in tights (other brand) AND I ordered one size larger than what is recommended on the sizing chart posted here - ie. I normally wear 1X (stockings, pants, undies), but I ordered 3x-4x. I wanted to try a brand that had tights that were slightly larger, to see if they would accommodate my apple-shaped tummy better, without being too loose in the hips and legs.

Instead, with these tights the hip-area was way tighter than my normal brand size 1X. I have average-size legs and small hips for my size waist (since I am apple-shaped). The length of the tights is good (actually, generous, I'm 5'6""), the width around the legs is OK, the width around the waist is good, and the length of the crotch to waist is good. But the width of the hips is a total mistake by the manufacturer. I see some other reviewers have stated this problem as well.

Concerning the ""fleece"" question that comes up in the reviews: I already have fleece-tights in my other brand, and frankly, the fleece on those tights and the fleece on these tights are the same. The fleece is not as you expect at all, it's simply a thicker, tighter weave with some nap, so there's less ""gap"" for cold air to come through the weave. They feel and ARE warmer than the sweater-tights I also wear (again, size 1X, other brand). Plus the nap feels cozy for your leg, just as the ad states here."
I ordered an XL when I normally wear a large. It is also extremely see through. Not really worth the money.
"I just got this today and it WOULD HAVE been nice if it weren't for all the bright yellow stains on it.  I am so disappointed in this.  It would be perfect if it wasn't stained. So disappointed, and I guess I need to figure out how to send it back.  :("
First of all let me start by saying that i have never to date worn this shoe and i purchased it some 2 years ago. It was wayyy too big although i order my size.
"This is supposed to go with the Alpha M-65 Jacket, but the buttons are all in the wrong place, and the sleeve attachments are weird. I bought a different, non-Alpha M-65 liner and it fit better in the jacket than this one."
Entirely too small. Order two sizes up.
These shoes were at the same time too large and too narrow. The strange construction of the sole gave no lateral support. Could not find either a statement of material of country of manufacture onthe shoe or the box.
"Too small, returned the item"
"It is gigantic, and not 100% cotton."
Horrible folds up
"This would have been a nice skirt but I just didn't like the way it was made. Way to casual, I was looking for something i could wear to work and this was not it. There are seams all over it but I was hopeful they wouldn't look obvious but they def make this skirt look very casual add on the fact it is a heavy cotton and that there is some type of embelm in the lower left hand corner. Its a weekend casual  skirt not for the office unless you work near a beach and can wear flip flops to work."
"I've ordered many Sakkas tops in the past, and truly they've all fit me.  I'm a size 12 or XL in a top.  This one, however, is severely mis-sized.  I would say it's the equivalent to a U.S. size small, maybe medium.  Definitely not one size fits all.  So disappointed.  The orange and white colors are so beautiful and I really wanted this to fit."
"The.  Worst.

Leg openings start out normal and within an hour of putting them on they are stretched out like a hoop skirt.  I usually use that as a sign that my briefs have reached the end of their useful life and waste no time in sending them to the place where old underwear goes."
Ridiculous small
"The photos in this listing DO NOT MATCH. I owned this watch winder previously and had to replace it. The spring loaded insert that is pictured in the 'main' picture shows the ""old"" style that will fit a smaller watch. The insert that came with this product is MUCH larger and even though it's collapsible, is still too large for my ladies' Rolex. Very disappointed."
Sent these back.
Too plastic looking and feeling.  I expected the shoes to be more flexible and natural.  IT was woven plastic and stiff.  Not a great shoe. Not worth the price.
Awkward feel.. not very comfortable
Not as posted.  Run extremely small!!  Looks like iron on details...no beading or nothing!!
Looks nice but didn't work on my watch winder
"The fit was right. No problem there. BUT ""BEEFY"" No NOT BEEFY not to me. Hanes you can do better than this. this T  weighs a couple ounces more than a regular pocket Tee It's not heavy duty , I bought 2 of these (this and another different color) and same with that. Is that how they are making 'supposedly' better quality pocket T shirts? I guess I'll keep them but I wish I had purchased the Stafford Pocket Tees from JC Penney. I have some Pocket Tees from JC that are about 5 yrs old and get a lot of use. AND still being used. They just have gotten stained (my fault) and look dirty,  because I use these pocket T's mainly for work. I don't see these Hanes lasting that long."
"Too small, and I will be returning"
Slots are far to tight husband cannot get his cards in and out without GREAT difficulty. They have not loosened up over time. Bought this for him for a Christmas gift. As of this date still to tight. Have to purchase a different wallet.
"Way too large in heel area, no grip, pretty hard-would recommend inserts. Returned"
Terrible- broke on the first use after about three turns and everything took bent.  I finally took a safety pin to push the pins out of he watch band- basically unusable!
The quality of the material is good but if you have thick thighs and butt you might need to as up. I ordered Extra large from the the reviews say i g they were big but the 2x would have probably been too big I'm losing pounds so I'm going g to keep them my weight is 200 now. They fit snug not comfortable
Nice but they run big and lose their shape a little.
Weird fit.  It was baggie and bunchy in some places too tight in others
"I consulted a New Balance representative via telephone before purchasing to ensure I would get the right fit and it would be a shoe that meets my needs, so, I am very surprised today at the disappointing results.

I said I wanted a synthetic shoe.  Where this shoe has been advertised as ""leather and synthetic,"" it is indeed all man-made materials. You can consult New Balance's Web page and see it there.

The other thing I specifically mentioned is I wanted a lot of support and cushioning, as an earlier 800 series shoe I once had offered but has since been discontinued.  I was assured this is the replacement of that model or at least a similar enough shoe to meet my needs.

So, I purchased via Amazon to save money, and had a 20 percent off one-time coupon and decided to buy 2 pairs.  It looks like both will be sent back for the following reasons:

1- The second I put them on, I noticed it was rubbing my large toes in the corner and after a few seconds was becoming painful.
2- There is a lack of support/cushioning with this shoe.  I felt like I was walking on two boards laced up.
3- While I was assured on the phone these walking shoes are recommended for those with orthopedic issues who need a walking shoe, it seems they will only worsen pain and discomfort while wearing them.

In my opinion, New Balance has gone downhill in the last four or five years.  I also find it inconvenient that they use so much mesh now, where they did not on some previous models.  The second it rains heavy outdoors, you have to get your feet soaked.  I'm guessing it saves them a few bucks to use mesh more than they once did."
"Cheaply made. Don't waste your money. Tried it on 1 time & the fastener & chain broke. It is pretty, but since I had to redo all the fastenings, NOT worth it."
Stones fell out within a few days.
Poor quality material. Hard on feet  Color and style is very good.
"I settled on these shoes as they were Asics, which are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, but these... wow they killed my feet. The insole is hard has a rock and already thin. Normally I'd replace it, but for some reason Asics lowered the mesh and etc to where even with the 4E it is to tight. The new insole was great, but I couldn't lace it up without hurting my feet.

The seller was great though, got here faster than I had been told, just not the right shoe for me. I'll stick to the Cumulus or Nimbus lines I'm used to."
"I loved these and they fit perfectly. Sadly, the day after the return window closed, the zipper lost a tooth and now they're useless."
Super cute but too tight in the breast area and to long for my liking.
shoulders are huge. the rest fit fine
"Way too small! I'm 5'5"" and these are about 3-5 inches too short for my legs"
HARD footbed. Heel pain after one wear. Returned.
"These are very attractive sneakers and I bought them an  alternative, for 'dress'  to my higher priced sketchers sneakers which I must wear due to slow recovery from a broken leg and foot. I wear arch supports and thus I  ordered a 1/2 size up as I usually do, that is  a 9, instead of an 8/12 which is my shoe size. The shoes are a bit large even with the arches so these shoes run big. Also my left heel seems to slide up and down, and generally I don't feel comfortable or secure walking in these sneakers. I am breaking them in the house, but I doubt if I would be able to wear these out without use of my cane for security, or for any length of time. I would not recommend these sneakers."
"Ridiculously long strap made it impossible to wear!  Sent them back.  Shame, because the star is stylish and well made....just tooooooo long!"
Wears out after a few washings.  Cheap material whit a high priced name.
"If you suspect the color that is in the Amazon web page don't buy it the.
Because the color on the coputer is burgundy and it arrived a purple color totally a diferent color to bad"
"Listing says ""USA or Imported"".  Well, mine were made in China.  They fit well, and were comfortable enough, but the soles, particularly the heels, were literally in shreds after 300 miles of walking.  I'm an old man, and all I used them for was walking on paved roads.  The rest of the shoes looked perfect.  These are expensive shoes, and they lasted only 3 months.  I can't afford $35/mo for a pair of walking shoes.  I replaced them with a pair of shoes with a Vibram sole, and now have 300 miles on those.  They show a little bit of wear, but nowhere near the shredded soles of the Keens.  Very disappointed.  I have some Keen sandals I like a lot, but this is my last pair of Keen walking shoes.  The soles just don't hold up."
This is an update.  Have put these on my suitcases for the first time due to an upcoming trip.  The ID tags will not stay closed if they are even touched.  They are basically worthless and will not work for what they are for !
The bra itself is not bad but fits a bit tight. This bra is not flattering to your curves at all. It actually flattens you out in the front with little or no uplift. Sorry to say but I will stick with Lane Bryant t shirt bras! I should have stuck with the tried and true but wanted something different and I liked the color. Lesson learned.
Cute shoes but I've come to determine after about 3 tries that Keen shoes just do not fit me!
"This underwear was bought for my mother, unfortunately it was way too small, even though my mom is not a big person. It fitted my very slim sister very fitted so I don't know where they get their sizing measurements from . I will try and refrain from buying underwear on line as the sizes are always either too small or too large... i keep buying for my relatives on line and cannot get the proper sizing because of their ridiculous sizing charts!"
"These sunglasses are actually pretty flimsy, as compared with older Ray Bans I own. I don't believe I should have to pay postage for a defective item. The arms were not level..when placed on a solid surface one arm was about 1/16"" off the surface..which doesn't sound like much, but they definitely sat crooked on my face."
It came broken in 4 pieces.
"Co u lo some one that bought this tunic parsley and sage please give you exact size and weight and what size you bought.  This will be more helpful to hose still wanting to buy,read reviews, and need more information.  It's nice knowing the fabric is nice, how to care for I but, I have purchased more clothing items on amazon based on reviews that give weight, height, and size purchased verses the size you normally wear, so I can compare your findings on my needs.  Other women find this kind of in go most helpful also.  Thank you very much.."
"gave it away, they did not fit at all..."
"This fell apart after a year.  The time was never consistent
and I always had to put it back to the accurate time.
It looks great and if you don't ever look at your watch it
is perfect."
"Cute and classy, but definitely more on the casual side for a blazer.

Update - giant rip after first wash! (Did not put in dryer). Very disappointed, I guess you get what you pay for.... :("
"Loved this sweater and fit perfectly.
The seam split from the wrist cuff all the way down to the waist within the first 10 minutes I put it on at work.
Not happy."
These didn't worked on my Pandora bracelet.  Maybe they will work if I get another type of chain.
"Much smaller than any D cup, this was more like a smaller C cup. Had to return."
I ordered the first my Mom who is in a nursing home ... she likes to walk... a lot... so I wanted to get her comfy shoes. These were surprisingly small and I bought them 1 size larger. Also the quality isn't good.
"my size L, and I bought A coat is very large, it may need to M, the quality is super"
"These were too big.  I even ordered a size down as suggested by the reviewers.  Also, the strap is not adjustable and were too loose for me.  I returned them."
"These shorts run very, very large, especially in the waist. I ordered the smallest size available and they were still way too big so had to return."
I would give this sweater  no stars if I could. I ordered 2 and they both came out of the packaging with bling falling off of them already
"This is for women, lenses are narrow an too tight for me"
"Very uncomfortable shoe, unlike my Gel Noosa 9 model which I love. The soles of this shoe feel so lumpy that it's like walking on rocks. They also run a half to full size small and are somewhat narrow. Very disappointing."
I hate these ugly shoes.  I wish my husband would stop wearing them. They're so embarrassing. Please stop making them. People think he's my dad when we're in public.
"It runs large. The sleeves could have padding added and still be loose, and the pulled sides just makes your arms look big. Not flattering."
Broke in less than 5 min very cheaply made do not buy
"Cheap feeling, doubt if real leather.  Feels like plastic, staying in a fixed position.  Disappointed."
"These are born shoes and I have several other born shoes and thought this would be nice, but they are the most uncomfortable shoe ever.  I can't even wear them for 1 hr.  They are cute but that's all."
"I was excited for this, when it came in it was bigger than I had hoped and the texture of it feels weird? Maybe I am just picky, but I returned it."
"So these shoes got some stellar reviews, and it's the only reason I invested in them. Folks raved about them and I can't tell you why. The strap is much too far forward to keep these shoes on your feet. The back is too narrow too, which'd cause blisters in the long term. They are deeply uncomfortable and a waste of 42 dollars."
"The fit is good, but it is quite sheer.  I ordered it in the red, and I would not be able to wear it without a tank top underneath.  It is disappointing that the material is so insubstantial."
"This was a HUGE disappointment.  The blouse is lovely -- the fabric is wonderful.  It's colorful and has a good feel.  But there is something really wrong with the cut.  The armholes and sleeves are tight and restrictive.  It was small in the shoulders and I do not at all have wide shoulders.  Actually wearing it would be close to impossible.  On-line, I noticed similar comments about other Lark & Ro shirts, but I ordered this one anyway -- big mistake.  They should do something about their patterns and be made aware of the comments.  Sadly, the fact that the fabric is beautiful doesn't matter.  I've sent it back."
This is definitely NOT AN ADULT hat I wear a 7 1/4 size baseball hat and it was VERY VERY small it could not even fit on my head and barely fit my two-year-old son's head
"These shoes don't fit wide feet, I had to return.  What a shame because they are cute but are cut very small."
"I have many pairs of size 39 Alegrias, even another Essence. They all fit, but this pair was too small so I had to return them.

The other thing is that from the picture I saw when I ordered I was expecting green & blue to be dominant colors. The shoes are actually black with multi color iridescent designs. From what I remember now purple was one of the colors. I don't think there was any blue & green. Huge disappointment."
Bulky~
"These jeans have a flap over the back pocket, which is not flattering to your butt.  Had I noticed this before, I would not have ordered them."
"Actually the color is closer to green, not khaki as the picture shows. Also a little small for the size, I think."
These were ok but my daughter I had to throw these to the recycle shoes because they didn't last but a couple of months
"Poor quality,don't like it"
Nice quality but way small
When I first wore them they were pretty good.  I washed them in warm water and they shrunk a lot.  The legs are very tight and I don't have big legs.  I thought then would stretch out like jeans often do but that hasn't happened.  I will have to go on a diet.
Very poorly made.  I wore these only twice and they came out of my ears both times and ended up loosing the back to one and the stone came out of the gold in the other.  I will not trust this brand in the future either.
"The case arrived with a snag or ""sprout"" in the exterior fabric of the bottom.  Seems to be of mediocre quality and the material a bit heavy for these days when saving weight is the name-of-the-game to avoid excess weight baggage charges."
Wasn't happy so gave it to a friend. Wasn't what I wanted. BUT I I've he color that's why I gave 2 stars.
"The metal piece in the middle of the shield (covered by thin cloth) is pressing into the forehead, making it a little painful to wear."
They fit well and are cute but the beads don't do anything like id expected.
"There was pinhole. of course, wear some month or year, It can be happen. but I ordered new product!!!

I ordered relaxed fit.... It's so much relaxed fit.... my wife told me this pants looks so big."
"Runs waaaaaaay too big. Im 54, size 6, 34ddd, and the medium went down to my knees and were just short of being a full sleeve. Looked more like a moo moo. Im not sure the small could be so much different that it could make a difference."
These are nice sandals but my problem is that there isn't enough room in the toe area. I don't know if I could truly recommend.
I had to return these shoes b/c they did not fit correctly. They ran too small.
"EXTREMELY TOO SMALL and I ordered 2 sizes too big.  On top of that it arrived with some type of PET HAIR all over it.  YUCK!!!!
Horrible Horrible product."
"Disappointed after this arrived, Like two sizes too small than other manufacturer's standards"
Shirt melts in dryer.
Extra large is small!
The material felt like plastic and the edges were roughly sewn. I didn't like it.
I must admit in the photo the dress looks so chic I was anxiously waiting for its arrival. When I got the dress it fit okay but the material was cheap. You can see through the dress.
Not as pictured!  Much smaller
"I know it is supposed to be looser fitting, but the size chart was off on this one. I am an 8-10 size so I ordered an XL and it was way too big."
I already have an ample bottom and this did nothing extra for it. Thought I'd amuse myself for the low price.
Fits a little awkward. Fits okay around the hips but too big in the waist.
"Shoes toe box is too narrow and crowds the foot.  No arch support.  This is my 4th pair of ""wave"" shoes and the first pair that fits this way."
too tight around the breast area cutting into tissue in the armpit are and rolls don make it painful and requiring adjustments
I ordered black. I received BROWN instead. I trashed it.
Looked good but the belt ripped the moment I tried it on.
"I bought 4 uniforms of the same size and the same model and I am totally disappointed because they run 3 up sizes, the fabric is too rigid, not comfortable. The only positive thing is that the colors are exact to those observed in the photos."
I was purchasing this watch for a child.  The advertising said suitable for boys and girls.  This watch is much too big for my 8 year old.
These arrived timely but the packaging was a disaster. It was in a padded envelope completely taped with clear packaging tape. I had to cut the package to open it. That's when it happaned- I cit right into the leggings. I know it was my error but the seller needs to re-think how they package the product. I gave it a two due to packaging and not being able to wear them.
They were way smaller than the size guide describes them. They were so tight they were uncomfortable.
"Skechers are good shoes for dress or streetwear they're very stylish in my opinion however, I would not recommended them for workwear. I exchanged these for a real workwear brand. I knew as soon as I saw them they weren't going to last in a true safety shoe environment. Spend the money and buy real work boots."
"Initially I thought this was cute and well made. My daughter is 3 months and I was looking for something light weight and warm for the car seat in the winter. It washed horribly, and she can't even wear it. The sleeves are way too long for her arms in comparison to the rest of the jacket."
"they weren't too small on me, they fit just right and I liked them the first two times I wore them.  However, after wearing them a third time, they got a hole in the crotch!  like not a run or a break, like the stitching on the seam came apart. Not the best quality product ever."
"Although the ad claimed it would fit my Casio watch, I had to cut back the strap and use the old pins.  I would not purchase again or recommend."
Not a true 37  or 7. Very large and loose sadly can't return it!
Item fell apart after one week. Not at all satisfied.
"Fits, but didn't realize that they were low impact. Doesn't help me much unless I'm just walking."
Don't waste your time.  They roll and ride up.
"Just received my shipment and found ""Made in China"" prominently displayed on the back of the outer package holding the 12 pairs of hand warmers.  WARNING:  THESE ARE NOT MADE IN THE U.S.A., so the ""proudly made in the U.S.A."" statement is a lie on the items' sales page here at Amazon.  I paid a higher price for these to support a U.S.A.-made product, and will not be buying this ""Heat Factory"" brand in the future.  Shame on whoever is outright lying to Amazon customers just to make a sale."
This was huge on me
I have only had these for a few months but they are thin and are already falling apart will not buy them again.
"The elastic in the waist is nonexistent and unless you have a really long torso, it will come to your mid rib cage."
"This is absolutely nothing like the description in my opinion. First, the material is extremely thin and I can't understand how they were able to take a picture without you seeing the models skin underneath it.

It's not flowy either. It's more of a spandex material so it's very form fitting. I need a large so I bought a 2 x as I read some said it ran small. This thing is still tight and I wouldn't wear it out for any reason. Not even if I put two more tanks under it.

I didn't ask for my money back because quite frankly I didn't open it for awhile. Stupid on my part but I was under the weather and just let it slide. Ah well. Live and learn."
"I bought 4 sets of knee socks for myself and gifts. The Sukkas brand is not good.
On sick will fit its mate is to small, the one style is theady the othe not. Really disapointed. Glad i got other brands also. Price had no bearing on quality."
Broke straight out of the bag. Very upset.
Review is in the title.
Beautiful and I ordered several in different colors but seems to break easily.
way bigger on
Really disappointed. I expect Nine West to be consisent in size. These are too small.
"I'm not a big fan of these boots. They are not a serious boot, more like a sneaker that looks like a boot. They don't have the durability that you would expect from a work boot.

They are definitely larger than standard size, but when wearing them with wool socks, they fit well. Too loose for me with regular socks.

I had to trade out in the insole, the arch was way forward. Not a typical issue for me. Once I did that, they got comfortable in about a week or so of light use.

They are comfortable for all day wear, but they are cheaply made. I used them as weekend winter boots and for travelling to and from work (not during the work day as I wanted to keep this pair looking decent). In the course of 4 months the shoe laces frayed quite a bit and a shoe lace hook broke. The toe leather cut up pretty easily too.

So far I received a boilerplate response from their warranty department. I tried these out to give another boot brand a shot and I can't really say much good about them. They did look pretty good for about a month but thats about it."
Just a dress to throw on. Plain and simple. Not all that as describe.
"I love them, but few months later, they broke up!"
"EDITED - no longer 5 star, the review below is no longer true. Don't buy them. They are going to run way too small. :( Now I have to find new panties and hope for the best.

This company's website has tiny models wearing their clothes (that is SO insulting) and quit carrying very many clothing options, I think they must be going out of business. I used to wear their pull on jeans from Walmart, great fit, comfy, looked good - but it appears they don't make them any longer - they are not on their website.

Are you looking for briefs that fit well, last and aren't all cotton...these are them. Not much else to say. I've been wearing this brief from this company for a long time, I love them, because I don't think my clothes are sticking to them. Pretty true to size, if not a little big."
Difficult to get these boots on without a zipper. The ankle was too tight and the shaft of the boot looked baggy. Do not recommend.
"Sunglasses are not very dark and they are not the glasses that are pictured, not even close."
Not Large hoops
The color that was advertised as tan was a yellow orange and the cover feels and looks more like plastic than leather
"Nice style and color, but way too small."
"Did not like the 559 jeans so I returned them and ordered the 550 which is my best fitting jean in 34x30.  Only thing is, just to be sure I order it in 35x30 and that worked great for me.  Great fit."
"Please note that these socks must be HAND WASHED to prevent shrinkage, they curl up into a ""ball"" if you don't hand wash and lay them out flat to dry. My own fault, this is the description as of today's date 12/1/13:

65% Polyester/32% Olefin/2% Spandex/1% Rubber
Hand Wash
Neon and fashion socks
Incredible value fun socks
Made in China

Prior to washing they felt snug, but smooth. After washing in a machine, they feel too tight, binding and uncomfortable. Lesson learned. I hope this helps someone else in their decision."
not what I expected.  too small and cheaply made.
just was not what i expected then they wern't comfortable sent them back
"I couldn't use it... they are a full size small and terribly narrow. Fortunately, my nephew liked them and the size was good for him.

I recommend to avoid them if you have a wide foot and keep in mind that anyway you would have to order them a full size bigger."
The multi pack colored A shirts received were 3 blue and 1 grey. NOT HAPPY!!!
"It looked like a 2T, instead of 0-3 months. I Had to immediately return it."
"Put in new batteries,  nothing happens.  Our 6 year old son was disappointed."
These shorts do NOT run true too size.  I had to order TWO sizes larger than my grandsons jeans.  Quality O.K.  Be careful with the size.  Will not order again.
weird fit for someone with a long nose
"Loved the way the bra looked but how would you ever know what size to order?!?  The sizing was so far off that I had no idea were to start to reorder so I just sent it back for a refund.  The sizing was so small that I couldn't even try it on.  The sizing is pathetic.  When you order your regular size and can't even try it on something is bad wrong.  The straps do not adjust and were so ""short"" that the bra would not even come down far enough on my chest that I could try it on. (Note the way the back is made and that statement will make more sense.)  And forget the ""superstretch technology"" for the straps - at least on the one I received that was a joke.  On the plus side, it looked to be well made and like a bra that I would have liked if I had any idea what size to order."
This shoe has a nice simple design was much too large for me (mostly too long) so I returned it.
It's beautiful but not a good quality shoe it looks cheaply made.
These run really small
They arrived as pictured but have already lost them. The backs don't stay on well which was very disappointing. Was a waste of money.
"I returned this pair of Florsheim slip-ons they just were to lite.
I don't believe that a $100.00 pair of shoes should be so lite.
The return went well ""THANK YOU""."
"Do not purchase this shirt. Took a month to get here from overseas and was nothing like it's description. Shirt is actually very thin polyester and the color is not gray it is light purple. Definitely a fake item, has no tags or markings in the shirt."
"I would keep these, but it fits oddly on my left foot, like the left side of the shoe is pushing in on my toes. (Length seems fine.)  Right shoe fits fine.  I could maybe assume think it's just a matter of sizing (since I'm between 8 & 8.5) and should go up a size, but the front of the shoe even looks different than the other...it's wider and the curving on the top of the toes just doesn't match the other shoe.  I have a suspicion that another pair of 8's could work for me, but not sure I'm going to bother trying. Disappointed."
"I wish I would've listened to the reviews on this one. The pictures taken are of the dress right out of the package. The seaming is terrible and the fabric is equally terrible. It feels like cheap Halloween costume fabric. The neckline is floppy and definitely not flattering as pictured in the ad. I highly recommend not buying this dress,  however alluring the ad picture is. I'm definitely disappointed."
"This was purchased to hide rolls, and instead IT rolled! Would NOT stay in place unless you don't have ANY rolls,and then what's the point of wearing it? Definitely not for the truly plus-sized women, meant more for the size 8 trying to hide her little muffin top, nothing more."
My daughter wears size 12 and these were at least one inch too big without stretching.
This is a quality apron and done well the only reason I give it 2 stars is due to the weight and shoulder straps it places quite a bit of tension on the collar bones and makes me weary after several hours.
"Disappoint - fabric texture is rough; elastic band rolls.  I have other Hanes boyshort that have very soft fabric & the band does not roll & are very, very comfortable - wish I could find those again"
"These pants are more expensive than the B290s and yet, they did not fit properly. The waist was about 2 sizes too small. Also, the seller Elite Hero made me pay for the return of the pants. Carhart B290s fit much better and are great for work and play."
The dress is beautiful but it is not true to size. It did not for my bust line at all.. I don't believe this is a maternity XL because I couldn't even fit into it. It has this tightness around the belly where there's no way you can fit through it if you're a triple D in boobs during pregnancy .. Too bad because the dress is gorgeous ..
"For me, I didn't like the polyester lining.  They are very cute, I simply wanted a more natural feeling slipper that would breath.  But they are cute."
I order the wrong size and tried to have them cancelled.  It was to late.
Itchy on my skin
"looks cool, but too small for a large person 6'3"""
the size fits as expected but i am not sure if these are made for taller persons or what. the V-cut comes all the way down below the bust. its is a very wierd fit.
"I've been looking for a supportive winter shoe that's easy to slip into without bending down to tie laces and that will keep my feet warm and dry.  Evidently my foot is a bit narrow at the back as they slip out of the Northside Men's Dawson Winter shoe when I walk. In fairness to the Northside, the same thing happened to me with L.L. Bean's Men's Storm Chasers, Slip-On Shoe. I returned the Bean shoe ($99) and was excited to find the Northside on Amazon, especially because of all the positive reviews and considerably lower price, but alas, the search continues...

For what it's worth, the Bean shoe did feel more built up and supportive inside (kind of like a sneaker) - I wondered how far I'd be able to walk in the Northside before they would begin to feel uncomfortable."
Read the Reviews but still took a Gamble on This Purse anyway...This is why I stay out of Casinos!
Loved them but I dropped them down the sink:(
"Based on some of the comments of this brand of sweaters, I ordered one size up.  My comments:

* The sweater runs short, length-wise, even after going up a size.  Even with mid-rise pants.  It's not proportioned right.

* The shoulder fit was correct after going one size up.

* The general fit of the sweater is body hugging (shoulders, skinny arms) until you get to the chest/midsection, where it becomes oddly roomy in the front and back.  It's hard to explain, but it looks weird.  My guess: issue with proportions again.

I got the sweater because it was the ""Today's Deal"".  Well, it's going back because it's not so much a deal when it doesn't fit right."
Shirt was extremely short and shrunk even more after first wash.
"Very disappointed! Some pearls coating  have  been  lost,  and it looks very cheap! Bought it  just because I  see a  lot of  praise. But  totally failure bought!  Just as a  toy,don' t  expecting more."
Very thin fabric. Too small. Returned.
"Angry that these didn;t fit as they are frickin awesome. The material at least. But they are made for guys with small legs, not for ""athletic build."" Not many pants are which is a pain, but whatever. If you want to look nice with your skinny boy legs, buy these."
"I returned this item.  It just flat out was not good.  If there was a clasp at the top of the zipper, that would be a slight improvement.  Yet the lack of lower abdominal support is a big deal.  Plus the zipper being super long, running behind the lower abdomen portion....just strange."
"I really liked the design with the roller bar on the cinch up side of the buckle, but I was very disappointed to have the buckle separate from the belt where is pressed on.  The belt is cut off and then buckle is pressed on with only two small nubs holding it and it separated from the belt with no way to repair it.  Nice belt - good leather but lousy buckle system."
this necklace changed colors in 3 day of me wearing it i took it off to shower and it still changed colors need to upgrade silver
Well...this was almost a hit but the holes for the breasts were just entirely too large and unmatched. My breasts are a solid 'C' cup so maybe this is made for women with really big boobs. If you do have large boobs than this would probably work great because it would cover up the misshapen holes.
They run large and don't seem to have much padding.
Gave it away as I really did not like the fit at all.
Makes my finger itch!
"This clip was too loose and didn't stay in place.  So, there was no point to using it.  I would not buy it again."
"I ordered these by mistake. If you want an athletic supporter, then this is the underwear for you. The fit is tight and there is no pouch. So, if you're needing something to keep bits in place, then this is for you. If you want something comfortable, the get the Micro Modal Trunk with the same material. Those are very good."
Terrible quality. Not happy.
Looks better in pictures. Fits larger. And the high back fits awkwardly. Returning. Cheaply made.
don't want to bother sending it back -  the extra large for big girls is much too small - will save it for my younger granddaughter
"Very hard and stuff. They do not warm up to your body, so they slip out of your bra. The shipping was fast, so that was good."
The  material wrinkles easily. Look terrible
"I ordered these in sz S (9-1)  At the same time,  I ordered 3 other sizes,  all this same brand (Jeffries). These are HUGE.  They are the same size as the M (12-6) socks."
"The top of my foot couldn't go all the way into these type of shoes.  I have several pairs of orthaheels in sandals, and tennis shoes and I don't have any problem with the fit or comfort.  These shoes were cute, but I had to send them back."
This bra is not true to size. The cup is about 2 cup sizes smaller than size states. Should probably try it on if you can find the correct size in any stores before buying!
catch broke off before I got to use them.
Bought the size I always buy in Easy Spirit 8.1/2 wide. Couldn't even get them on my feet. They run much smaller than my other Easy Spirit Mules. I have 4 other pairs. These were more like a size 7 even thought they said 8 1/2 wide right on the shoe. . Had to return them.
"Was not high waisted at all and definitely not a size 18.
Can't seem to be able to review the blue and black jeans separately. The black jeans fit great"
One fits fine...the other seems to have the arch support out of place.
"This bra literally broke the first time I wore it.  The wire popped out of the fabric and started poking me.  It is super cute, but unless you like mending clothes, pass."
So I think the quality of the material and everything is great it's just that it's tight. I'm a 46-50 waist and this one I bought was about 1 to 2 sizes to small...
Cute shoe but WAY TO SMALL!!
much too small and uncomfortable. Happy about the return policy :)
"The fabric is fine, but the cut is really weird on me, something about it feels off."
"I am disappointed I bought this product. I hoped that it would exfoliate the skin, thus aiding in the fading of post acne marks. Unfortunately I experienced no results with this, even when I used it every night for several months. This led me to searching reviews online to see what others have experienced. I found out on Paula's Choice that this product contains so little glycolic acid that it's ineffective, and the pH is not in the range that would allow the acid to work properly on the skin even if there was enough of the acid. This explained why I was experiencing no results. The grapefruit and aloe vera in the product doesn't help my acne either (which one thinks it would), which makes me wonder if this product is simply 99% water. This is a large waste of money. When I use this, nothing happens and my skin is the same as when I don't use it. I still have the majority of the bottle and don't think I'll ever be able to finish it up because it's an unnecessary step that doesn't benefit my skin at all. If you are looking for a product to exfoliate with glycolic acid, try Ren's Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask. That product actually works and results in bright skin. Don't waste your money on this!"
Bought these for snow boots.  Descriptions doesn't say that they are not.  Would not buy again.  Wish it would have better description.  Sending them back!
"2/9/19

Bought first one

3/6/16
Battery started dying less then a month after I ordered it. No big deal, it happens. It shouldn't but it does. When I opened it up to replace the battery, the plastic bezel had been sliced almost all the way through. Returned and bought the same exact one. The watch is hard to read in the dark when the back light is on.

Update 3/2/18

Went to change the calendar today and the button you pull out to change the time and date broke. It snapped and pulled all the way out. Luckily Amazon gives a free 2 year warranty so it is getting fixed for free. While it didn't show up on the order details page, it did show up on the watches new purchase page. Funny enough, the warranty would have expired in 4 days. I started the warranty process today. I will update when I hear something back.

Update 3/23

Asurion called and said they were going to refund my purchase price as its to expensive to repair. So basically I got to wear the watch for free just short of two years. Would I but it again? Probably not. The watch never really worked right, and I had to send it back twice in 2 years. I bought for around $110 and its now $60. I think its still over priced based on my experiences. Email with the Amazon gift card refund was received today as well."
"shrunk way too much, not a good fit, and sewing is awckward around the waist. this was large for a 6'3 thin man. i shoudlve bought x large."
Watch arrived broken.  It was a cheap watch for a child.  Meant to teach him how to care for a more expensive watch later.  This one would not have stood a chance.  Returned it for a refund
"The quality of the fabric is not the best, comes very large"
Broke :( It was a gift for my sister and it started to tear days after purchase. Returned for a refund.
"I am very upset pedi and lenses I sold it as original and are not originals are made in China, do not understand why they sell it with the price of an original, it is a scam and a hoax. what a disappointment."
NOT VERY BIG AND FEATHERS WERE ALL BENT NOT VERY NICE LOOKING AT ALL GREAT TO GIVE FOR A CHILD TO PLAY DRESS UP ONLY VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS ITEM
It's fake and I threw it in the trash.
"Beautiful ring, but arrived with the center stone so loose that I'm afraid to wear it."
Had to return because fit was wrong.
will make do.
"These are great boots and really cute but I didn't realize they came up to my knees.  I have bigger legs and what I consider fat knees and I didn't like how these boots looked on me.  They fit just right size wise and felt comfortable.  I would recommend them to other folks who don't have the same issues as I do.  Unfortunately, I had to return them."
The second time I used this it stopped closing. It was sold through a FBA seller so I question whether it is authentic Totes product because I have never had an issue like this. I've used Totes for years and have always been happy with their products.
Just horrible. Returned them.
Didnt like. Ugly and look cheap.
"The heel tab that sticks up a quarter-inch in the back is a real nuisance. You don't notice it initially, but after walking a little bit, it starts to rub, then it starts to chafe some more, and then after 20 or so minutes it's starting to turn red and close to bleeding. Had high hopes these would be comfortablebecause isn't the whole point of Crocs all about comfort?!but that couldn't be further from the truth. I honestly don't understand how more people aren't bothered by it (and it has such a high rating, too), but the discomfort level is very high after a short walk. I tried cutting it off as others had mentioned, but that didn't solve the issue and only aggravated it since I couldn't get a clean, smooth, non-abrasive surface line in the back and is still cutting into my skin. I barely walk at work and they've already become uncomfortable by noonthat's how bad they are! If I didn't step into some wet yellow paint in a parking lot the first day I wore them, I would've tried to return them. And donating them seems like cruel and unusual punishment to the next wearer."
"Before ordering I reviewed the size chart and read the comments which were all over the place regarding sizing.  I'm a US M but my measurements fell more in the XL on the chart.  And with so many people say that the Avidlove products (this and others) run small, I decided to order the L and XL.  Way too big!  I need a M and will be returning these.  It's very frustrating when size charts are completely wrong.
If it helps...I'm 5'1"" 145 lbs 36D and 41"" hips."
"The overall problem with CROCS is that they don't come in half sizes and they run a half size too large. Of course, if you are normally are a half size then buying CROCS will not be a problem for you. Unfortunately for me, I wears a size 11 (42), so I need a size 10.5 in CROCS, which they don't make.

The problem with this particular sandal is that the strap closest to your toes is too tight, and the strap closest to your ankle is too wide. My little toe was in pain the moment I put them on, and the first strap was not tight enough (not adjustable) to hold my foot securely in the sandal."
"Very nice shirt but too small!  There is absolutely no way this is a size 18, it would fit my 8 year old and he's tiny."
Shrinks when washed
"I purchased this set in mid August 2013. The bags are nice lightweight plastic, rolled well, have nice handles, lovely rose pink easy to find at luggage carousel .  Used the  for two trips and while leaving airport on second trip wheel housing/wheel came off. Contacted travelers choice 12/6/13 re the 6 year warranty  only to discover it didn't cover wheels.  You decide if you would like to travel through airport with a gimpy suitcase."
"She picked these out for her own gift.  It has not been cold enough for her to really use them, but it is what she wanted so I will rate them at 5 stars.

Ok, this is a text from my wife:

No. I don't like them.  The mitten part does not stay on, thumb hole on one glove is larger making my thumb always stick out and the velcro is cheap so the mitten part does not stay held back when trying to use as gloves.

Guess, they are not worth the money, don't waste yours!"
"Nice looking jeans but very baggy in butt and thigh area if you are NOT a curvy person i don't recommend these! Also very long im 5'3"" and i would have had to get like 3"" s taking off them to not be dragging on the ground"
"This thing is WAY too short, it's falsely advertised. I'm a size 10 in jeans and this thing wouldn't even meet end to end let alone clasp on one of the actual circles. The best part??? They want you to return something they falsely advertised!! I $20 piece of JUNK is what this is, IJS..."
Giorgio Brutini should consider making this kind of boots wider. I'm still trying to break 'em in but it's still hurting my feet.
"These were a classic example of you get what you pay for.  They were junk. One of the pairs, the stone had fallen out. The setting were loose on almost all the pairs. I had just had my ears pierced so I needed the surgical steel posts. I took a pair of jewelry pliers and squeezed the setting around the stone so I could wear them. I really doubt they are surgical steel. It would be more trouble than it worth to send them back."
Uh..do NOT try to wear without socks like it shows in ads for this Lacoste design disaster. I tried and now have to bloody scabs on over my Achilles tendon on both feet after an 8 block walk. The cushy back of the shoes fabric rubs a blister faster than you can say Lacoste Men's Jouer Slip-On. I'm calling the my Lacoste slip-ups. I am keeping the product because I wore them outside before wearing them around the house...my mistake. Coolness factor for these is lost according to my partner when wearing socks to protect the back of my heels. :(
Poorly made and lower than average quality. Not supportive and too narrow.
I had to come back and change my review because this ring completely lost all its color. it is now a dull gray. very disappointed
"If only it looked like this, fit like this...what was i thinking. OK - you get what yo pay for.  This is NOT plus sized. It is a very inexpensive material that shows every unflattering bump and bulge and frankly - must be worn under something else OR would be a great PJ.  In fact - that may be what i use it for - since it's cool/thin."
"The package arrived quickly and in good condition.  However, I thought that these earrings were real 925 sterling silver, but now after less than a week of wear, I've got metal allergy.  I would not recommend these if you have allergic reactions."
"Not only does the shirt run small (smaller than a size 5), it is also a baby style shirt with snaps at the neck."
"I ordered these for my wedding day, after reading reviews on how comfortable they were

They arrived very nicely packed, and looked super pretty.

15 minutes into my dress fitting, I was dying to take them off, already had blisters forming"
"Hope you don't have to bend over unless you want your cheeks out, and the chest area is too small for a c+-d size!"
"I was expecting these to be a higher quality, thicker rubber shoe. I paid $10, but they are comparable to the $5 flip flops you can pick up at Old Navy. I imagine these will also allow thorns to go straight through the sole."
"These were pretty uncomfortable.  They are durable, but the little nubs on the bottom make it a little difficult to walk.  I prefer the flat moccasins."
"The bag I received was defective. One of the metal pieces that attaches the leather strap to the bag was detached. Although I would have liked to receive a non-defective replacement, the vendor's poor response combined with Rothco's apparently lax QC make the decision to re-purchase a likely unwise idea.

The bag has appeal but it's sloppily manufactured."
"View is always up, not very attractive"
"Cute coat, but runs very small.  I couldn't even get the 2 sides of the coat to touch in the front, let alone button it.. that's how tight it was.  So order a size up, or two, if you order this.  Also, they made me pay the shipping to send it back, which was almost $10.  So that pissed me off furthur.  It's not MY fault the coat isn't true to size."
returned product
damage
You get what you pay for.  It is very thin and cheap.
My boyfriend can normally wear a 2X with quite a bit of room to spare. This ran so small he couldn't even close it over his chest! The material is also very thin. Very disappointed and will be sending this back.
Don't buy this TRASH! The needles loosen and goes to back and forth as slack itself.
Very tight in back. Not satisfied. Bought large and my granddaughters wear size 5.  Smh
Shipping was prompt as always. This was a surprise for my grandson.  He loves the sneakers but he is not able to wear 2 left feet.  Will return and reorder the same at an increased price :(
Did not like at first then broke then in loved them. Wore them for about four months and they fell apart right along the sole and the seam. Would not buy agaiN
Very Stiff shoe with very poor arch support.  Not very supportive. The shoe has already worn down on the inside and I don't even wear them ever day.  The had to purchase other foot support to make them comfortable.  Very poor quality!!
Extremely loose material and size...I follow size indications and comments...but they are so loose that really i will use them at home..don't know when..since they are underware... Can ware it on its own..
"good for weekend get away but the quality is poor. I use mine for gym, and the stitches around the edges are slowly falling apart after one week, i only load with bath towel, shirt and shoes. not worth the price."
"Cute, but a stone was missing in one of the earrings, and I had to send them back."
I have no idea where they got their sizing from. Perhaps this is a kids size? Every part of these are super cheap I was not able to try this on as the size was really far off (I ordered a 12 and what I received was maybe a 0 or 2.
Didn't fit.
Very uncomfortable cheap material. Really cheap. Scratchy and just feels nasty on your skin. I washed it hoping it would be better but no luck. Save your money.
"Nice hoodie, but not 100% cotton
60% cotton and 40% polyester
With the skin allergies my family has, 100% has always helped.
I would have returned this shirt but, I paid a little over $3.00 for it and it's at least 60%. It's not worth the waste of paper work and shipping supplies to send it back"
"This is NOT real leather. I have a lot of real leather products to compare and this smells and feels like plastic. The fit is awesome though! I have a 42 inch chest, 18.5 inch shoulder and 32 inch waist. 5'9 180lbs with an athletic build with broad shoulders. I normally wear large jackets and the large fit perfect and the sleeve length was just right."
"Seriously!! It's been only a month and it's already ragged!! Unbelievable!! We help our son to carry his backpack so there in no actual reason for this to break so soon. Usually they last all year...don't buy it, not worth it!!"
"This watch is pretty and very nice.....in the picture. I am not a petite woman, but I am not a big woman either. I am of average build and this watch is huge on my wrist. Some of the other watches atleast have a picture of the watch on a womans hand so you can see how it looks on the writst of a woman. I was very excited when I opened the box up and saw that I had gotten this watch that I had had my eye on for a very long time. When I went to put it on, the watch is not only very big, but heavy as well. Very disapointed, atleast the return policy is easy enough to do so returning this back to Amazon was not a hassle."
"I loved these pants the first couple of times I wore them. They fit well, dried quickly, and protected my fair skin. Unfortunately, the stitching ripped in the crotch after only three wears. I had only worn them to the pool on vacation - no water sports or vigorous activity. I am really bummed."
"It's a beautiful ring and has lasted well (I've had/worn it about 6 months); however, I am only giving it 2 stars because it is advertised as a silver finish, high polish ring - and while that's what it looks like when you get it (gorgeous!), it very quickly turns gray and no amount of cleaning or polishing will bring back the silver look."
It collects pet hair like it was designed for that purpose. Fits more like a medium.
"I purchased these and the mary-jane style shoes.  The others I bought in the 42W, these in the 42WW--the other reviewers aren't wrong, the width is huge.  I generally buy boots a little wider so I can wear thick socks, but I could wear three pairs with these.  Even with an insole, they're still loose, but they were cheap enough that it's not worth returning them.  Not very cushiony, either.  Leather is decent quality, and they will do for occasional wear, but they are not the everyday boots I was hoping for.  Length seems slightly shorter than the other pair I purchased, but not so much that you would need to size up.  Definitely would not have paid full price for these."
This necklace is smaller than usual and I did not really like it. I was a cheap little stone that i felt I could have got it on a coin machine prize. Not worth it and very cheap material. You get what you pay for...
fell apart after 2 washes
"I have worn many Stacy Adams shoes and have been happy with the quality for the price-point.  This is the first pair I have purchased that creek / squeak when I walk in them (more of a creek than a squeak).  Its almost like the wood sole has a defect or somehow moves against the rubber.  Maybe they are knock-offs or a defective pair, but not happy with them."
"The skirt is extremely thin.  The belt buckle is made from cardboard and when I gave it a little stretch it unraveled from where it was sewn to the cardboard.  It came as expected, but unable to use it.  Great price, but I threw my money away on this one."
Don't for well in the butt region. Higher wasted than I thought as well.
Very thin. Useless. Seriously. Do not waste your money. Maybe it's not meant to be for warmth. It is smooth.
Cheap and not good for anyone with a bust.
"It just barely out of my hands on wooden floor
And the screen cracked"
A bit too loose.  Also not as comfortable as other crocs .  Not so cute as the photo.
The fabric is very cheap quality and seems like it would easily tear.  I returned these and got a pair of more comfortable and better quality Wranglers instead.
"If it's lightly drizzling, this is nice. Anything more than that and it's about as helpful as a grocery bag. I wore this out during a storm and was completely drenched after walking one block"
"This is a useless piece of fabric that will not support your knee in any way. I have a torn miniscus and bought this for a lighter option. While my measurements were accurate for the fit of top and bottom, it still digs into the thigh a bit.  The fabric offers zero support, I'm not sure why this product is described as it is.  If you're looking for some extra support while you walk or exercise, or just every day wear, this worked as well as wrapping a piece of cloth around my knee."
Maybe I have small ears but the Infiniti sign was too large and was very uncomfortable in my ear. I took it out after a few hours.
Half the lights on one of the shoes don't work at all :(
Got a lot of multiples.  It's stays to have certain things & then the rest are random.  Well the whole bunch was random & not really worth it
It's not stretchy or anything. It's foot size is fine but the bands do not fit well around the foot and ankle.
"Just got these as a gift for my husband and when I took them out of the box I couldn't believe how narrow they were! I decided to try them on since I am always stealing his current slip-ons and they were snug on my female size 8 1/2 foot - I can't imagine how he will get his men's size 9 into these? There are for Christmas tomorrow so I won't know for sue until he opens them but I have a hunch they will be returned. Bummer, I was really excited for these....

PS - The box shows these are made in Vietnam and they seem pretty light and almost cheap considering the price - was expecting something more quality then this... <:o(

Also the pair I got are Grey, Black and White - where the picture on Amazon looks almost Brown, Black and White - Not a huge deal now that I really look at the pic, but a little misleading."
Started tearing on the side after not too long. Too bad because hubby loved them.
"Poor material, bad finishing, I ordered a couple of them and one came with a missing button, very disappointed"
"These fit fantastic, but pill up really bad when washed. I washed them turned inside out in cold, and hung them to dry, and they pilled up pretty badly nontheless. These must be hand washed and hung to dry."
This is the first time I ever have worn this type of t shirt and I don't think these are for me. I ordered the same size I always wear and these are very small and tight. The shoulders itch and are uncomfortable and the material is poor quality. One by one they will go in the garbage.
Gems called out within the day!!!
"Very comfortable and stylish.  True to size.  Very attractive.  Silver and Gold so goes with anything.  Would recommend to anyone. UPDATE:
After a few months of wear - one of the straps pulled out of the bottom of shoe so I went to amazon and bought another pair because I loved them so much - few months later the 2nd pair strap pulled out of the very same place as the first pair. Changed my rating to 1 star."
My 2x was like a size xsmall
"I like the unbalanced hem but the shirt is not white as stated, it's a dirty grey look that states ""I washed my whites with my darks""."
Started falling apart after a few washes
"I was very disappointed in these scoop neck tees, so much that I almost through them in the trash and then thought, no perhaps someone might really need them so I gave them away.  I will not purchase such a cheap item again, cheap and it is cheap; I'll go back to paying $29.00 for at least a shirt that is made of material that is quality; this was not quality."
"Very cute shoe. Unfortunately it was much wider than other crocs. ""Relaxed fit"" was written for on the packaging not the description. Bummer :("
"This is the first time I've ordered Dansko shoes online or worn them. I ordered a size 38 which is my usual size with European sizing. The shoes were huge and wide. The worst part was that they appeared to have been worn before. There was a hole worn through the pewter finish on one of the toes and a large, very obvious scuff mark next to the buckle on one of the shoes. I returned the shoes and was not given the choice of a refund so I re-ordered a size 37. They almost fit. They are a tad too small but I'm tired of messing with this company. They need to have half sizes. The good part--the shoes are very attractive and I like them. The arch is nice. But my toes really hurt after an hour of wearing these shoes."
"These shoes are too small. If you want them, buy a size larger."
"This dress was VERY pink, not what I expected on the top and light on the bottom. Colors did not seam to match. Thin and straith in the skirt not at all as full as the picture looks. :("
The shoes looked very manly and when I put them on I could feel the sides of the insole as if it didn't cover the entire bottom of the shoe. Very uncomfortable.
I've worn these boots by crocs for less than a month and the back seam is already split and a button from the side has fallen off..they are really warm and comfortable otherwise.
"They're longer than they say.  I got two pair of 40X32, got each from different sources despite both being on one order from Amazon, oddly enough, and for the first time, I've had trouble with the pants being so long that they fall under my heels.  So, I got out the measuring tape, and the inseam was actually 37 inches, not 32 as stated.  Both pair, despite being from different sources!  I've only worn each once so far.  I'm still trying to figure out how to hem up the cuffs so I can wear them."
"I heard such good things about ASICS shoes from many of my tennis friends so I wanted to love them.  The good thing was, it was wide fit for my wide feet and it had a good arch support.  The bad thing was, it was a bit high around the ankle so the part that was below my ankle was digging into my foot and I couldn't focus on the game.  Even today, a day after the tennis, my ankle is still tender to the touch.  It's a weird fit - for me."
Not a real bra
they broke through the bottoms within 3 months of random here and there wear! DONT BUY FROM THIS !!!! AWFUL! ! ! ! !
Cute but pilled badly on the first wash. Needs better quality fleece.
"Size is weird,  really big!  Top straps are extremely close together,  looking funny when worn."
"I love bandannas and I needed some more.  I am used to some very heavy ones that I have had for years.  I use them for everything, as a cover for my nose, to cool me, as a handkerchief, you name it.  These are not like the ones I used to buy.  they are alot thinner and scratchier and don't look like they will last and do the job like I would hope.  It is a shame as I am still looking for those high quality ones I used to get."
Update these shoes no longer fit after my son wore them for a month. Dont buy
The boots fit very poorly. Very loose on the calfs. The suede is thin and uneven in spots. Not good boots.
"These are gorgeous, However, left sores inbetwwen my toes and tops of my feet. This occurred only after wearing for 20 mins, which was driving g and picking my kid up from school. Sadly, I can't return "
"I returned these, while they fit comfortably the top was just way too tall and too wide for my liking. It hit right at my knee, and I could fit my whole hand inside next to my calf with a little space to spare. While I'm normally a wide-calf boot buyer, these were just too wide. The back detailing was nice, though."
Like the look of it but it scratches really easy unlike other titanium rings
"What can I say, just didn't like it"
The fabric is too thin to wear it unless you want to wear a slip under it.
it was CRAP!! Very flimsy
"Very uncomfortable shoe to work in all day, very tight fitting."
"Junk, cheap, very poor quality!"
"these are terrible quality! they're sooo flimsy!
just by opening one of them i bend the heck out of it. now its in my ear and i cant get it to close because it just keeps bending funny. and i cant get the darn thing out now either! these are horrible!"
"I'm returning this blouse, it has an obnoxious chemical smell to it, I don't want to wear something that I have to air out before I put it on. just looks tacky and isn't a large and ""flowy"" as I thought it would be. Too bad, it's fairly priced and I'd have ordered other colors."
I might have suspicions about authenticity
Sizing chart no good.
Stones very very small
"These boots are clearly good, solid quality, and although it is very difficult to find an affordable leather boot I am ultimately returning these. The shaft height is, as other reviewers pointed out, awkward, with the front of the boot hitting above the knee though the back is at the knee or slightly lower. I don't consider myself to have very skinny calves but these were too wide in that area. My boots also arrived with scratches all over the leather. Truly, these boots were a disappointment. I would not recommend them."
"Between my 2 girls, they already have the Prom, Frankie and the Milo. When the Garden arrived, I was surprised to find that the base of the bag was not as padded as the other 3 models. It feels really flimsy compared to the other 3 models. And because the base is so thin and unstructured, the items in the bag weigh down the base, causing an unsightly bulge at the bottom of the bag :("
"I wanted to love this, but it just fit really weird. the sleeves were really long and the shoulder seams were so off they were on the middle of my arms. The arms were tight but the body was too big. It had many loose strings. I saw lots of people with good reviews, but they seemed like they bought smaller sizes? Maybe it was just because I bought a larger size?"
This is not a One Size fits All - it may be a One Size fits up to.....  I have a 38F chest and this was way too small for me.  It is hard to comment on the actual dress since it was so small. I the color was as expected and I imagine that it would have been good for my up coming vacation....if it had fit.
It was HUGE!
This is supposed to replace the 1123 and in no way is it a good shoe. Stay away...... so maybe New Balance will redesign this shoe. BRING BACK THE 1123!!
"I ordered my usual size I wear but it was very tight in the sleeves, not like a peep shoulder fits definitely. Honestly I don't think if I had ordered the next size up they would have been much looser, that's how tight they were. Didn't fit like the picture shows."
"I wear a size 7.5, so I ordered an 8. One fit, the other one, I couldn't even get my foot into it. It would appear that the thong/toe piece is too short, so you can't slide your foot into it. Very disappointed."
This shoes were stiff and were poorly balanced.
"Weird fit, didn't look right on me at all. I've noticed this brand has a bit of a cone-like effect on me... Might work better for some, but these just made me feel like Madonna in the 80s."
Bad quality!!!!!! The fit was not right and the color and texture changed completely after one wash 
"Very disappointed after reading all the ratings I thought it would be a good shirt. I usually don't rate items, but I was so disappointed. It shrunk immediately, so every time I wore it (which was often because I worked in a restaurant) I had to pull it down and every which way to get it long enough to tuck in. The collar got all messed up where it was folded. My LEAST favorite thing about this shirt was that it faded within a month or less. Very aggravating! Just looks tacky with an all black uniform. I would not recommend it."
"I have problems with my left foot.  The right shoe fit very nicely on my right foot, but when I put the left shoe, it made my left foot hurt. Shoes look nice.  Too bad they made my left foot hurt. Sent both pairs, beige and tan, back to the company."
"Not very well made, in fact they look and feel very very cheap.  Feel like they're made out of paper.  "
"My bad, this pack is way too big. The zippers are terrible! I would return it but it would cost more than just donating it to Goodwill. Oh well."
"Bought a pair last spring in black; they fit great. Bought a second pair in blue this November and had to send them back because they were at least 4"" smaller in the waist. Pretty sure they were given the wrong tag at the factory."
Runs very small and short.
This garment was so poorly made - it reminded of something I sewed in my first home economic class and it was 3 sizes too small!
It says 0-3 months but it should just say 3 months.  A 6lb newborn baby cannot fit into this.  It's too large.  The shirt quality is good but the romper quality seems cheap.
I have always worn these panties but not the Classic.  The Classic seems to be different has to how they fit. They are extremely thin from what I'm used to. The fabric is so thin you can see through it. I will not purchase these again
Don't like the hat it's too big !!
"While these Jockeys are soft and comfortable, they lack other qualities I think most men want in underwear such as a firm waistband and snug support. To each his own. If you prefer underwear that is just a covering with little support, this may be your new favorite. If you want good, snug, comfortable support, look elsewhere."
"It is long, does not hold a cardigan too close."
"Kinda hurt to use, and make my boobs seem even bigger."
the picture is deceiving it is very short
Too tight no small
"This hat is not wool but a polyester/cotton blend. Which means reshaping anything, including the very wrinkled brim (from being folded for shipping), is pretty much impossible."
"I try various boxer briefs because I wear lined dress clothes at work so everything runs smooth and layers correctly, and I hate having to constantly re-adjust my underwear from leg-wedgies (underwear that rolls up and becomes REALLY distracting and uncomfortable... not to mention visible). What's the point of purchasing boxer briefs if they roll up into ""whitey tighties"" anyway? So annoying, AND expensive in this case.

The material for these are very nice, breathable, and the waist band is to die for comfortwise. The first on or two wears were great, but after two cycles through the wash, these ride up constantly just like old school boxers (I have two pairs). It seems the construct of these boxer briefs have a leg length seem to be exactly the right length that would make high performance tri-shorts ride up. I cannot imagine how uncomfortable it must be to wear these while working in some occupation that requires a lot of movement and awkward positions such as squatting, kneeling, crawling, etc... these things ride up after just sitting in the car on the way into work."
Disappointed. Thought it was a bangle that went all the way around. It's actually a cuff connected by a clasp. It's nice enough but not what I wanted.
"It is accepted quality but the size little bit smaller than expected....the price is tempted, i reordered size large...."
"Ok so I loved this bathing suit at first, it fit so well. material was nice and thick. However after 1 wash, ONE WASH, it broke. the straps came off. I was so upset because I truly liked this bathing suit. so if you purchase this--wash it by hand instead or you are wasting your money"
SEE THOUGH AND CHEAPLY MADE
Very ugly poor quality fabric. Not at all wat the description say or the pic shows. The pants was generally too big yet the length did not go all the way down to my ankle. The fabric did not withstand more than 2 washes. I would not reccommend
Elastic at the leg bottoms was non-existent.  I'll be returning these.
Way too long and when I cut it the ball wouldn't go back on.
NOT A MOOD RING
"Fabric very thin and ran 1-2 sizes too big
still never worn"
"The reviews are overhyped.  This thing fell apart.  I bought it in 2013, and I was hoping it would last longer. Pic included of it tearing up."
"Super cute and warm boot but the zipper broke within the first day, I told my daughter she wouldn't need to use the zipper to put them on but you know how kids can be. The zipper holds no function really, especially for a 5 year old and it is still sealed to keep snow out. Just mad it broke so easily."
I really wanted to like this ring but I just did not. It looked very fake to me and the diamond was way too big for my taste. I understand that it's not real and I wasn't expecting that it would look that way but this ring & diamond looked costumey and very cheap. I ended up sending it back.
"It's a Playtex so it's a goo bra, bit the reviews that said it lifts like an underwire, ilim not sure they had ever worn a Playtex underwire before.  I will wear ar home but not in public. I wanted a bra to hold up the Tatas  not let them hang!  It is comfortable that's why I gave 2 stars. Will not make this mistake again. I wouldn't have the nerve to return a bra otherwise I would."
I don't carry much in my purses. And with that being said....this bag is heavy by itself alone. When you add to it it just gets heavier.  Great quality.  Just exhausting to carry it around when carrying it for quite the distance.
"The sized fits true, I wear a 9 and this is how they fit. However, the front of the sandal has a large gap since I don't have a high arch. Looks good, terrible fit!"
These earrings are so tiny they are ridiculous. I will give them away. Perhaps to a child.
"Not sure what Hanes changed in their X-Temp socks, but the ones i got from amazon were thinner, smaller, not as elastic, and kept slipping to where it would unravel around my heel (within my shoe)."
"Poor material quality, bad fit.  It's cheap though, so there's not much of a loss."
"These were way too long and too wide. The size on the shoe said 8.5M, but they were much bigger than an 8.5M I'd tried on locally. I returned these and bought local. They are a versatile style that can be dressier or casual."
Product arrived very damaged and not usable.  This was a gift that turned into an embarrassment.  Not happy at all.  Disappointed and upset.
Waist is about 2 inches too small.  The material is VERY thin...easy to see my underwear!
"Really gorgeous but my normal size was way too small. I even did all the usual things to stretch them out and the shoe definitely stretched out in width, but they're just too small. The back strap also goes kind of low on the ankle, so instead of wrapping around my ankle, it was low and sort of hugging my heel and they didn't feel very stable."
looks better in the online ad.
Very stiff. went with another model carport
"The boots would have been great ...........EXCEPT the zipper broke during the first week of wear. When I inquired about a replacement, I was told that they would only replace them if they had not been worn. (?)"
"These looked really cute, but are cheaply made. One of the bracelets broke two days after we gave them to our daughter for Christmas. She's in middle school and wasn't overly rough on them."
"Not sure with a XL ""slim fit"" that I can't get it over my head.  I am not fat, but do weight 215.  I didn't see ""slim fit"" when I ordered it."
scratchy and tiny. Sleeves are too short and the front shows my belly button. I am 5'8
Broke the first time my son touched it.
These lapel pins are ridiculously huge.  I regret this purchase.
"Very dissatisfied and let down by Levis.  Levis is part of the USA economic problem.  On the same day, on the same order I bought 4 pairs of 559 jeans in same sizes but different colors.  Quality is trash.  All, ALL 4 pair of pants were from 4 different countries (Mexico, Bangladesh, Colombia, Lesotho, and The pair I already have is from Pakistan.  5 pairs of Levis all from 5 different countries and all 5 fit very different. The only thing in common beside the labels was the horrible stitching that was already falling apart especially on the back pockets.  I guess even China was too expensive for Levis. Never Again."
"too big, i ordered a large but got definitely an x-large"
the size is not correct.  Most xlarge products for women are size 16/18 not 12/14 as this was.
The band was to small.
"Not very soft, not very stretchy, I popped out a lot, and the band is very thick and gets sweaty."
"Very flimsy... the padding inside the shoe isn't attached,  I can literally take the shoe apart. Cheaply made. Feels like a house slipper,  I wouldn't have spent that much money on a house slipper. Very disappointed."
the jacket was torn Small hole and scratch
"Not worth the hassle to wear it, or the money."
"Keeping this because I can make some use of it and it was cheap enough. Credit cards only fit in three of the slots, paper money does not fit unless folded and my Samsung phone just fits."
Top barely fit me and bottom was way too tight. But good material and style for what it's worth.
"Gave this this to my daughter in Red, she just loved it.  She is at Parsons school of Design in NYC and her students loved it,  I ordered the Purple for a friend of hers, this one had a ticket on it  WARNING:  This product conains chemical(s) known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm.  I returned it, would have returned the Red if my daughter had not warn it, hers did not have this sticker on it.  Guess you are only protected if you live in California.  Disappointed Amazon sold it without warning."
"This looked so great when I saw it on the Macy's model.  It doesn't look great here, and this shapeless oversized bag is what it really looks like.

I was under the mistaken impression this was a winter, wool coat.  I wore it when it was 39 degrees Fahrenheit, and I froze in it.  The coat is incredibly thin, and the wool blend it not up to the job of keeping you warm."
"I normally wear the crocs 'Bistro' model. They have a fairly high back fitting around the heel and keeping the shoe on. This Yukon sport clog has almost no rise in the back around the heel and they keep coming off unless I fasten the strap around the back of my foot which makes them much harder to get on and off. I am getting older and don't bend as easily as I once did. If I have to fasten the strap around the back of my foot, I might as well wear shoes that I have to tie while getting a lot more support."
"Very poor quality. Also I am 5.3 tall and weight 115, with enough muscle in my legs and they fit too big!  They are not tight or stretch enough. Fits like a pijama.  I am totally returning them."
"They are very tight around the ankle and require alteration in order to wear them. I had to cut threads that were causing the sock to fit uncomfortably,  I do wear however, they are not my favorite socks while they are cute I would never recommend them to a friend."
"If I had to guess I would say someone cut out the pattern improperly and the seamstress just sewed it together anyway.  It is tight under one arm and not the other.  I didn't bother to return it I just threw it away.
Color was what I ordered - except for the one arm, it ran fairly large.
I am 5'6"" 125 pounds and ordered a medium."
These boots are quite tight around the ankle and fairly tight at the top.
"The skirt itself is very cute, however, as others have said the waist runs small and doesn't have much stretch.  I'm 5'2 and wear 4-6 but have curves and this just doesn't sit right on me unless I pull it up high waisted.  The good thing is the length is right for us that are short. The ""drawstring"" comes unattached so you can wear it with or without.  I would have preferred it sewn in.  The colors are pretty and quality is good, just wish that waist had a little more give to it and it'd be perfect."
It came much smaller than I thought.
"I am a Clarks devotee, know my size in Clarks, and have worn Clarks clog style shoes for many years, so I was disappointed in the fit-very tight across the bridge of my foot, which makes my foot slide back, I am hoping that with some wear they will loosen up, but I am used to out of the box comfort and wearability from Clarks. I have noticed that there are very few clog styles available right now, so I had few choices. Style-wise, I like the look of the top, the heel is a little frumpy. I like my Walking Cradles with a short stacked heel better."
I returned the hat because it was very much too small.
"These arrived on time and that was the only positive I have to say about them. The studs are NOT baby/child friendly because the stems are too long. You would have to remove them each night so that they don't hurt when laying down. The quality is very poor, the stem bent just from trying to place it in my child's ear. But the worse is that if they are not even close to being gold colored; when I opened the box I thought they had made a mistake and shipped silver studs. The photograph is quite misleading.

Overall, I am not happy with this purchase and do not recommend this earrings. After this experience, I would not buy anything else from The World Jewerly Center again."
"Unless your feet are narrow as pencils, these shoes will NOT work for you. I was so excited to get these, but the straps are weird, the width is too small, and the fit is just bad. The only good thing about these sandals is the material; the sole is spongy and the straps are nice and soft. BUT too small."
"This item ran small, I ordered 2 sizes up and it was still snug.  The fabric is very cheap."
"Broke the first day that it was worn. I understand that its costume jewelry and you get what you pay for, but my son was pretty disappointed."
"This shoe fell far short of my expectations given all the great reviews. It just didn't fit my foot, and not in a way that can be fixed with sizing. The top part just wouldn't let my foot through, as though my foot was just too tall. and when I shoved it in after much effort, then the fore foot was too loose with the very top being uncomfortable and tight. I liked the squishy feel of it, and I'm sure it would be wonderful to walk around in... if it fit my foot at all."
I love this necklace but some of the beads are already falling off...The price is fantastic so I might try again.
"These are not worth your money OR the length of time you have to wait on them to arrive.  The connector piece broke yet he 2nd day I wore mine, and i fixed it, only to have the other side break the following day."
Bought sandals let April and the toe strap broke early July. Warranty is only valid 30 days so I got hosed.
The dress we received only barely resembles the product picture. And the size 7-8 that I ordered should actually be sized as a 5-6. My average sized 7 year old looked like a blue sausage in it. The butterfly neckline is tight around the neck hole so that it looks sort of like a turtle neck - it doesn't come close to being over the shoulder. The front of the dress is knee length - not ankle length - and the back has a sheer section that droops down to the lower calf. The silver glitter on the skirt is actually pencil eraser sized pokadots. My little girl was so disappointed. I ordered a different dress right away. This one is on its way out.
Am returning.  Not the Hanes Quality I am use to
Way too stretchy and no support.  Do not buy.  I have back trouble and needed something for really painful days.  This is not it!
After 3 months started delaminating on the outer sole. Being disabled I don't hike and lately don't even walk much. I hope I can resolve this.issue.
The fabric is horrible quality. It ripped when I pulled the sticker off the leg.
"small, small small (but I have larger hands and arms, so maybe just ""small"")"
"The fabric is thin and the seams are a joke. Mine was shedding threads out of the package. Returning for a refund. Also, the arms are disproportionately short."
"Very poorly made, not worth the price, save your money."
didn't really stay for long .. they got all kind of wool stuff hanging on them that made it look cheap but i stayed warm for the winter
didn't like the quality.. returned them immediately.  Not something to shop online for.. I found out.  Bought them local where I could try on.
The concept of heating the shoe and molding your fit is great but after trying my normal size 10 the upping to a size 11 my foot was still hanging outside the heal. I just returned both pair and gave up on the concept as just not meant to fit my wide foot. I would say their weight and quality appear to be excellent once you get to your molded fit.
"First of all I had super high expectations of this dress from looking at it on the model. Very reasonable price and seemed to be exactly what I needed. AS soon as I received it, I opened the package and it SMELLED like strange chemicals. Second, I tried it on and it's COMPLETELY see through!  Third, The part that 'appears to be a waist, is cheap elastic and very visible so it looks horrible.  I hate this dress!  I'm so mad I wasted my money on it."
"For maternity pants, these pants are much too small with *very* little stretch and give around the waist. I usually wear size XL, but decided to order up a size (XXL) based on reviews -- but even the XXL was already very snug (I'm only 24 weeks, so I have months to go)! I'm returning these pants and looking elsewhere."
Iam waiting  for my small size  I order small  and I received  a M and is super  big  on me because  I only 115 pounds  woman
"These shoes are so cute and very sexy on the foot. But my feet are completely black every time I wear them. I have sprayed them, tried wiping them down, it comes from the leather and the base of the shoe.  How embarrassing. You can see it as you are wearing them. Needless to say they sit in the box and have only been worn a few times. Not happy."
"These jeans were like stiff stiff canvas even after washing multiple times
material is a huge rip off"
Nice t-shirt but came too late
"So I had originally wrote a review for these a couple months ago. I'm writing this now as a warning.

I had bought a pair of these around the holidays 2016. I still have that pair, amazing slack/jeans.

Last month loved the original so much, decided to buy another pair. Accidentally ripped the new pair. Didn't think anything of it, because I was bending awkwardly.

So just bought this new pair, they just ripped sitting down. Same rip, same area.
Also kinda of funny cause lost around 10lbs since the holidays and the original pair I can do squats in them if I so please and they are fine.

So to end this was an amazing product, but the newer line is very easy to rip.
Also because they are a stretch material you can't sew them effectively unless have a machine to do so."
Very unattractive shoe.  Looks like the old man orthotic/diabetic shoes.  I also had to buy new insoles for them since the shoe didn't have an insole!
i give kid play
"I ordered 1/2 size up but they were still too tight and narrow
Also the material looked stained on one of the shoes"
please no replacement  these shoes just do not fit  thanks annvery narrow
"I ordered two to use as swimsuit cover-ups because I'm taking a water class every day. I ordered the black fish dress and the white fish dress and put the navy one on my ""Later"" list.
So disappointing! This cotton fabric is extremely thin and scratchy, with no stretch to it whatsoever. Very uncomfortable.
I ordered them in the same size I have worn for over 20 years, and the fit was awful. Cut very narrow, especially in the too-short sleeve and shoulder area. So sad not to have good-fitting T-shirt dresses to wear with my suit, now REALLY ticked that I have to return them at my own expense to the seller before Amazon can issue my refund. Will not order from this supplier again."
"I  returned I couldn"" stay in it"
cheap cheap cheap - these were terrible.  I returned them.
scratchy cheap looking lace.  Ended up sending back
"It's a gorgeous watch, but it's not very smart.  I am always having to reconnect it, and it doesn't keep accurate track of my steps.  If you're just wanting a nice looking watch that will sometimes buzz when you get a text/call, then it's great, but if you're wanting it to do more than that then this isn't the watch for you.

I would give it five stars for looks, but one star for the technology aspect, so I averaged it out to two, since its main feature is that it's Bluetooth enabled."
While these were what I was looking for (slippers when on an airline flight) the sizing is off. I ordered in my size range and the slippers are too small and press against your toes.
"Rather than return the boots, they were given to a friend that has a smaller sized foot.  These boots were at least one size smaller than marked.  Otherwise the quality seemed appropriate for the price.  The width seemed about right."
"One more of those blouses that looks comfortable and cute on the model.
It looks as though the birds were painted on with house paint.  Seriously!"
"If this is Calvin Klein quality, then I'll never buy again.  Very thin.  I'm afraid to wash it."
I don't like the quality of this belt for moeny I payed I think it could be way better.
I wore it once!  The tank fits very snug and the over shirt fits very large (a little bigger than I expected).  I washed it and put it on a plastic hanger and it immediately tore!  I was so upset!  I have ordered several shirts from this company and usually very satisfied with them!  However this time I can not say the same!
This tank top was way too small but the straps were way too long. It looked like I put on a child's size shirt that was way baggy at the top. I wear small size normally with no problem. The return shipping price was about half the purchase price. So not worth it.
"I wished that the leg size was tapered to the bottom cuff. These look like bell bottoms, or boot cuts. Returned them."
The seller said water proof when it isn't
Hate it. It looks nothing like picture.
Fabric is horrible. ..very cheap
"I bought the correct size for my height and weight, yet they do not come close to fitting. The legs were too short in comparison to the long torso section. I'm quite disappointed with this product."
You get what you pay for and these were cheap in price
"This model has a problem... What is it??? I don't know... The issue is simple, when I use this I get Fasciitis like pain, knee pain and some ankle pain. I have Sauconyssss, Newtonsss, Mizunosss, New Balancesss, Ultra Zoot and those pain I've never experienced with any of them.

I can't run or walk because the fasciitis like pain comes and you can imagine running...

The shoes has a good cushioning and support BUT I have been reading about them after I get the pains and multiples user of Kayano 22 say the same thing, They have experience pains like mine, using it.

Once I take Kayano off, the pain goes away (Literally)... Thank to Amazon that accept the return.

Take care..."
"Definitely not American sizing. Im 52, 140lbs and I could barely pull these up to mid thigh."
"I beleive this shoe is specifically designed for people who use orthoditcs in their shoes.  I, however, do not.  The shoe bed is very deep and came up almost to my ankle causing the shoe to rub, therefore, making the shoe very uncomfortable.  I will be returning it."
"After reading the reviews, I ordered one size smaller, and they're still huge! I'm sending these back and getting the smallest size available."
"Could not adjust the straps very well. Only one loop was in the metal clip thing, so I could make the straps shorter, but then there was a long piece of looped strap just hanging there."
"Feel good,but no arch support at all."
I believe these are NOT genuine Ray Bans... The quality of the frames as well as the case are poor. Expensive knock off's... I ordered another pair of Ray Bans at the same time from another vendor and the difference is huge! Buyer beware....
"Too large for my taste.  Yes, the measurements were given, but didn't realize how big that would appear."
"This bra was so uncomfortable I couldn't get it off fast enough.  You couldn't pay me to wear this for a full day.  Itchy, stiff fabric is not something I want to enclose my girls in, and I wouldn't torture anyone with this.  This boggles my mind, why any manufacturer would use this fabric and realistically expect a woman to wear this against her most sensitive skin."
the edges don't stay down.
The large is really pretty small
I don't like these at all. The top scrunched elastic looks cheap as does the laces or shoe strings going up the back. I don't like these at all
"cheap didn't last.  skip the cheap slippers and buy quality.  slippers take a beating. sorry to say I wore these out in about 6 weeks. now if you twinkle toe them maybe they will do better for you.
I find it hard to be totally negative anout a product....if it's inexpensive well ole adage
""you get what you pay for"""
"Dulled boots and a lot of dripping. While I used it, I had to use a beeswax base on top of it to buff back my Justins"
"Well, first off, the sizes are not correct on this shirt, i would order a size smaller if i were you.

Second, i am very mad at them because i actually mailed their customer support and provided my weight, height and everything and they said 2xl was PERFECT for me. Its just way too big, i am 6,2-- 270 pounds and an XL would probably fit perfect.

Third, the shirt is not expensive and it is very comfortable to exercise in, thats the only reason im giving it 2 stars. Super lightweight also."
"Great for walkers as the shirt is comfortable and perfect for power wakers or hikers.  Very happy with the purchase

Update review.

I would strongly not recommend this product.  I bought several because I love the fit and feel of the shirts.  Once they went through a wash they started falling apart and now I am dumping them into goodwill.  They snag very easily and after several washings, the shirt material falls apart.  DO NOT BUY."
Super uncomfortable and awkwardly shaped. I'm going to just make my own.
These are just ok... The memory gel foam sole has gone almost flat after only one week of wear.  I should have spent the extra $20 for the Nike sandals like the ones i bought these to replace which lasted a year.
"Blouse has no shape.
Very disappointed."
These socks rolled down to my ankles and started hurting.  They felt like they were constricting my ankle.  They left a groove in my ankle and when I pulled them back up they still hurt.  I would not buy these again.
"It went around my body fine but the cups did not sit where they would lift my bosom. If that makes any sense. So sadly I am returning this super cute suit, because apparently I have a long torso?"
Cheap material and decal. I was not impressed and wouldnt recommend!
This is a piece of rubbish
All the reviews said go up a size so I did & these were big. I waited a while to get them as they weren't 'prime'. Cost me $20 to send back. Bummer
This belt is of very poor quality; it started delaminating after a few months.
"Used to buy this brand in grocery stores.  I guess I no longer know how to guess size; it was huge for me.  Don't know if I can use it for any occasion (requiring dress) or not.  On the positive side, it is certainly stretchy."
"Aside from the fact that this item bled horribly in the wash, IT IS MASSIVE!

For the record, this scarf is 40-inches x 40-inches square!"
Very Itchy
These didn't even remotely fit me. I was so excited to get them and they were way too small!!
Returned. Material was bad quality colors were not like pictured!
I was very disappointed in the product
"nice and finish very pretty but  and that is what we get for what I paid
 fade out to soon I wear it 2 times only
 great seller .. quick delivery
thank you"
horrible horrible cheap material.
an extra large is actually a US size small
Too narrow even though marked wide. But really cute (:
The center stone is very large and gwaudy not what I was expecting to see. This item is very cheap and fake looking and not worth even a small amount of money. Not to mention the necklace came completely tangled and there is absolutely no way of untangling.
"Nothing like the appropriate size, waist too small,  length too short, really inconsistent. Got a charcoal pair, fit fine. Am preparing to return the tank pants, as we speak."
"I like the ring, but the color is fading."
it has a stupid cell pock
Quality of the shoe is nice but I own several pairs of Adidas and these ones run really tight in the toe box.
"These shoes were so cute, however I couldn't wear them because I got them in my size and I should have got them in a whole size bigger than what I wear."
"I ordered this shirt in a size small and in brick red. What I received was a boxy monstrosity in a god awful coral color. The description says the fabric is chiffon but it doesn't feel like any of the other chiffon items I own. It feels like it's made out of the same material as hospital gowns. I contacted the seller as it wasn't prime when I ordered it and received an immediate response saying they were sorry I was unhappy and they'd send return instructions later. Over a week later and I'm still waiting. I was so excited when I ordered it and planned on buying it in black and in blue as well. Now I'm very happy I waited. Overall I feel like this item is poorly made, poorly sized, cheap material, and the color was way off from the description. Based off my experience so far, I would not purchase from this seller again. I received a discount in exchange for an honest review."
This shirt is not sized correctly.  It runs super small.
"Unless you like itchy yarn around your neck, don't buy this scarf."
These are hard as a rock. The bottom is pretty ok but the rest of the shoe is made from REALLY hard leather or some sort of cardboard even.  Returned (very easy to return and refunded which is nice).  I put them on and had to immediately return.
This is an extremely thin tee in the style of a sweatshirt in that it has a band around the bottom. I wear a 16 and ordered the x-large and it was very tight. I was so disappointed in the fabric. I would not recommend.
"Very pretty, Very sexy. One day while out at a casino it busted open on me and literally tore to pieces like a sheet of paper.  It lasted long enough for about 3 in-house wears.... The first time I attempted to wear it out, tragedy struck. I would not waste my money on another of these because the bra part was not as complimenting as it appears online, and the hooks are almost impossible to get closed. Once they are snapped closed they did not remain closed.  At no point did the weird shaping at the front of the corset conform to my shape and provide the silhouette that corsets are used for. It looks very nice in pictures, however. Great corset as a prop shirt."
Description says leather but it feels like plastic. Feet feel cold and wet in these shoes. At the end of the day socks just get all wet. Poor support if you have to walk a lot.
The first couple of tries I couldn't get the back part on my foot so I wore them like a slide.  After a week of that I stretched the back manually for about a minute and managed to get them on.  Once on they are comfortable but slippers should not be this difficult to get on.  A wearer should be able to slip into them.  I still need to bend over and work the back to get them on the way they should be worn.  The sale price was ok so I kept them.
"Had to say something, For years, I have let winter trap me in the house,, No more, bout 27 degrees this morning, so out i go for a test drive, These were the ideal thing, after 10 minute felt no cold coming through to chill me,, So i will say it passed my test drive,,, coming back inside won't heat you up either as long as your not working,,,

I'm not one who likes to deceive people, but i know i have so i will say Sorry to those i did. I wore these around the house during the winter for less than a month, and here is what happened, the elastic band started stretching so i used a safety pin to sure them up, and dang they stretch out more, well, needles to say i bought 3 pair of these, and i burnt all three,"
returned - didn't work.  Shame as it was very pretty.
Quality is not there.  Certainly did NOT meet my expectations.  Needs to be returned.
"I ordered the small and they are HUGE.  I weigh 142 pounds and wear a size 6 shorts, so I'm not sure who the small is supposed to fit.  If I pull them all the way up so the crotch is actually at my crotch, it puts the waistband all the way up to my belly button, the sides way over my hip bones and the back halfway up my spine.  The back satin panel is all saggy and droopy and way too big.  I used the ""size chart"" on the order page when ordering, too.  It lies."
The sparkle on the tips of the shoes rub off easily leaving behind white net-like cloth material.  Not durable enough for a four year old.
"I like most people read reviews thoroughly when deciding to make an internet purchase. Thus, I was completely blown away when I received what I thought was going to be the most stunning and gorgeous ""alternative"" wedding set. First and foremost, for $161, this set should have at least come in a box instead of a ziplock bag. Second, this set was HUGE! It probably would have been more convincing if the stones were not place completely around both the band and the engagement ring. This made the ring bigger than it should have been considering the total weight of the stones. It literally swallowed my finger when I put it on. Needless to say, this was the quickest return I have ever made."
"The yellow gold ""flash"" quickly disappears and you have a nice sterling silver toe ring. I really wanted gold for a permanent look, but I still wear it as silver."
"Poor quality, but even worse, the sizing is WAY OFF.  I normally wear a ladies 8 or 10 top. I ordered a large, thinking I should be more than fine.  NOT.  This shirt is sizes for a 10 year old child.  Avoid this seller and this item."
"If you don't mind losing the skin on the back of your feet, these are fantastic shoes. I really wanted to love these because they have much more comfortable soles, width, and support than you can get in the Converse... but unfortunately they gave me horrible blisters on the back of my feet."
"The mask doesn't look like the one in the promotion, and it was too  small."
"I was so excited for this top to come! What a disappointment. It's not even the same pattern as the picture. It's also really wide for how ridiculously short it is. Usually, crop tops go down 2-4 inches past the bottom of the bust. Not this shirt, this barely goes past my bra line and if I raise my arms, my bra shows.

The material isn't see-through, but is incredibly thin.

And then there's the time it took. This took over a month to arrive.

Oh and the smell. How could fabric smell this offensive? It smelled like an explosion in an auto body shop mixed with cheap cologne."
"The product works, but saying it ""comfortably fits sizes 6-10"" is a lie.  I'm a size 9, and not only is it difficult to get the sock onto my foot, but once on the little straps dig deep into my foot and leave me with ugly red marks."
Quality inferior
shoes were really wide and so big in the toe area that I could not keep them on my feet. you have to have fat feet or really high arches to be able to even have the leather top touch your foot.  I even went down a few sizes. Over time I can only assume these would get even more stretched out and not remain wearable. there was no support in them but the leather was of a good quality.
Cute shoe. Asked for 6 and it fit more like 7&1/2. Sent them back and reordered from the clogshop.
"Look great ,but after first time of wearing  it cracked in front"
"The picture did not match the hat I got.  I received a blue and white beanie, not a brown sweater knit billed cap."
This was awkwardly long for how tight it was...
Too small/tight overall.
"I can tell it's a well made product...but the sizing is off. I bought a 5x I normally wear a size 2x shirt and size 24 in pants. I could not get this thing around my breast (44D) and it only covered me below my breast..to my belly button(I'm 5 foot 9) I also let my mother try it and it barely fit her (she's 5 foot 6, 40D bra & size 16 pants) I can't see it being useful when it doesn't even cover your stomach and the top is so small that it doesn't cover your breast."
"While this costume looks cute the quality is horrible! While I didn't expect uperior quality based on the price I sure did expect it to not unravel after 30 min of putting it on my 9 year old. He is special needs and doesn't ruff house but mostly sits and rocks, the seams litterally looked like they were unraveling and the first hole was visible an hour into wearing it. Luckily it looks like it'll hold up for the couple of hours trick or treating at least but then it'll have to go in the trash, no playing dress up."
"Good idea, but very neglectfully done. The shoulder and head piece are extremely uncomfortable - they keep shifting, and ""adjustment"" is needed every couple of minutes. I don't know what kind of fabric is used, but my grandson was practically wet, though he didn't have warm clothes under the costume's jacket. The poor boy got exhausted after several minutes of Halloween celebration, and told he would never try it again."
Looks flimsy next to other beads we've bought for her bracelet.  She is going to put them on a cord and wear separately...
"Cute enough, but I was shocked to receive this item. It seems way overpriced for what you get. I know it's ""green"" but it amounts to a very small ""green"" thing.

I expected it to have a bit more personality in real life. Instead it is a very ordinary item. Were it $10 less I'd give it 4 stars.

It was a little embarrassing to give as a gift, as it seemed so inconsequential, but I wasn't going to go out an spend more. I should mention that the recipients LOVE it, as they are very eco-conscious."
"The sandals are absolutely adorable, but unfortunately they are uncomfortable and they run one to two sizes big. This is unfortunate because they are very cute sandals."
"These were disappointing for fit, will stick with my other New Balance walking shoes!"
I ordered a 1/2 size larger then I wear and they were so tight I could not get them on !
"Nice looking.  The metallic backings are worthless.  One almost fits snugly; the other, totally loose and ineffectual. Now I'm looking in my drawers for the big plastic backings."
"Sleeves are short, appear to be maybe for a petite person, or maybe used as a 3/4 sleeve. Needless to say, I can't wear it and it's not worth it to return."
"Loved this bag when I got it, got so many compliments. Unfortunately within less than a year, the leather started peeling off the handles and the bag itself. I would like to get a replacement but Amazon doesn't offer it. Waste of $100"
"I am a 38 DDD, when I put this on in the store I thought ""Great! Its fits and it's affordable!""  Then I wore it for an hour...these underwires have NO cushion at all, the wire is thin gauge and it just jams you right on the ribs...aweful!!! For big girls, Wacoal is worth the $65!!"
Sent these back should have read other reviews. Runs small.  very cute though
"I wanted to love this shirt, as Lee Riders is one of my go-to brands for casual wear. The style was unflattering on me. The shirt didn't fit my body type properly. It looked bulky and the sleeves were too large. I'm returning this item."
Disappointed because the picture and description featured stars as texture.
"I loved the fit, the look, color of these for my daughter. They had good reviews as well. One of them literally fell apart after two months (they were not even worn everyday). One of the loops broke off and then the entire back of the boot came apart breaking the boot. VERY DISAPPOINTED. My daughter needs a pair of rain boots and these didn't even last a season. Will be contacting Oakiwear as this is unacceptable."
"In the beginning I thought I was fine wearing the shoes. However, I found peeled skin on my achilles heel area and got pain after half hour walking. I brought them to a shoe repair store next day, and requested to stretch them wider. It's ready in 3 days. I haven't picked them up yet and hopefully it will help. I am not funny paying for the addition."
The shirt is way too small for me.  I usually wear a XXL and this isn't even close to fitting.  I wasn't even able to get both arms in to attempt to put it on.
"CAN WEAR ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME.  CAN'T WEAR FOR TOO LONG. THESE FIT, BUT ARE VERY HARD TO WEAR."
Unfortunately they are too small to fit over glasses.
"Not the greatest but you get what you pay for I guess. The top handle is already ripping off after not even 2 months of use and only 2 days a week. Literally hanging on by a few threads.

My son loves Paw Patrol but the equality on this one isn't good."
"Went right into my giveaway bag.  Pretty colors.  Voluminous made me feel as though I was in a child's dress, not a woman's top."
"I always get XL in these type of Lounge pants. most are either perfect or a bit on the large side for a comfy fit. These lounge pants were so small, I was shocked. Very cheaply made as well. Paper-thin material and I am sure would have ripped had I wore them and bent over too far. Very disappointing, but you get what you pay for."
"Unfortunately, the belt I received was not the belt shown, nor in fact is it anything like the belt shown other than being the same brand. The belt I received was a very cheap, almost plasticky-feeling tan pressed leather belt, non-reversible, with neither a feathered edge or top stitching. It also has a different buckle. The worst part about this belt, and the thing that makes me hesitant to send it back and re-order the correct belt, is that it has a powerful and most peculiar odor that I can only describe as being reminiscent of the cadaver room in my Anatomy & Physiology lab. It's a strong enough odor that I can't have this belt in the same room as me, not because I'm squeamish, but because man, that smell is bad. It's just a bad smell that reeks of decay held at bay by chemical means. It's a smell that, quite rightly, says ""don't get any on ya"". It's a smell that is going right back to the Amazon warehouse or, failing that, into the incinerator where it belongs."
"Too short!  I bought a Medium & I'm only 5'7"".  The pants barely touch my shoes when I'm standing & when I sit down, they rise well above my ankles.  Material seems a bit flimsy & the logo is a cheap iron-on.  Disappointed."
"This coat fit too large across the shoulders/arms and too small across the chest. In other words, it was cut pretty weird. It was also shorter than I was expecting (even after sizing up per recommendation of other reviewers). Also, its VERY thin. Maybe more of an early fall fashion jacket than a coat that would keep you even remotely warm. Perhaps if you wear a US X-Small, have a smaller bust, and are under 5' 5"" this would work for you? Otherwise, I'd pass on this one."
"not as cute as I expected.  Tacky looking soccer mom shoes, but comfortable."
Can not get wrinkles out with wash and dry.
"I am very disappointed that this hat looks a million times better in the pictures and in the description. What I received was a poor quality hat. It was way to big and ill fitting. The beige/tan colored, thin, flimsy fabric was bleached looking, just a very cheaply made hat. I have returned."
"VERY thin material and see-though when you bend over.... Length is too short. I'm 5'5"" and 120lbs.  My torso and legs are evenly proportioned."
Not a true 5x
"When this hoodie came it arrived faster than estimated which was nice. It looked great and was packaged well. My 12 y/o son loves this hoodie. We've ran it through the wash once and the printed design didn't hold up well, there's damage. I'm super bummed but my son still wants the sweatshirt. I wouldn't buy from this company again as I have doubts as to the quality of the screen printing. Also, I don't know why the product says ""small"" we didn't order a small. We ordered an XL in forest green and that's what we have."
Not very comfortable and not breathable.  Really wanted to like them.  love the colors but will not be using them
"I had this strap for more than one year ago. It was good and only a little bit smaller than the original strap that I had previously, but that was OK. However, I noticed that the color of the this strap has changed from the the black to some kind of dark purple!!!!!!"
Not one size for all. Got my money refunded.
seam was torn/unsewn on arrival
"I bought this romper because I have the same body type as the model in the picture so I thought it would fit nicely. When I got it tonight and tried it on it fit horribly and nothing like the picture. It comes to my knees, is very baggy, and the pattern even look different. This was such false advertising and such a waste of money. The only place I would maybe wear this romper is to bed. I would not suggest buying this item nor would I ever buy from this company ever again."
I did not realize this was so short! I'll figure out a way to use it as I like the color!
"This bracelet is NOT turquoise, it is dyed howlite.  Saying this is Genuine Turquoise is not true at all!  NOT turquoise, dyed Howlite"
Junk... And Small.
"Nice Bag, but Very Disappointed.  It's very small!  As per the description, I was expecting a nice Xtra Large Duffel that could hold a weeks worth of clothes.  Id do good to fit 3 pairs of jeans and some tops in this bag.  I needed this for a trip I'm leaving on tomorrow.  I had a very nice large one I was going to use that came up missing when I was going to pack.  Reviews said how large this was so I ordered it for 1 day delivery, and the description dimensions seemed adequate.  What a waste of my money.  Now I have to run to a store at the last minute and find an acceptable bag."
Sizing is way too small so I gave it to my daughter. Quality isn't that great for the price either.
these are so small and the clasps are so tiny they must have been made for a small child's hand...sorry had to return them.
"These were comfortable, but unfortunately they shrank after usage and possibly after getting wet.  I do not recommend this product."
What I ordered was not sent as pictured. The belt I received was not as long as the picture.
"The dress was cute and flattering but after washing it once, all the lace came apart. Now I can't wear it anymore."
The fit was a little bit off so I ended up just wearing larger sized non-maternity scrub tops.
"I'd love to say I could wear them all day, but they fit too small and I was not able to wear them at all.  Cute shoe."
I ordered 2 packs. They did keep everything dry very well. Fell apart after a few washes.
I regularly buy these boxer briefs and am typically very happy with the fit and comfort.  The latest order however was not up to standard.  One of the boxers had a hole in in right out of the packaging and the fit was much larger than normal.  Also the boxer seem to ride up - which wasn't an issue with all the other ones that I have bought
Way too short...I gave them away.
Zipper broke the first time I put my stuff in the wallet. Not happy with it.
I returned the jeans - not a good fit
"The inseam is way too long.  I ordered an inseam of 30"", these must be at least 32"" long.  I have several pairs of 527 jeans all with 30"" inseams and they fit great, this pair is obviously sized incorrectly....very disappointing!"
This shoe ran a little large so I ended up returning them.  Has excellent ratings but it was a little too bulky for me.
"I bought these earrings for my 5 year old before our trip to Disneyland and was very excited about them.  When they arrived one of the pink jewels was missing.  The posts are also unusually long and the screw back only twists on a very tiny but, so they pretty much hung out of my daughter's ears.  I would not recommend these."
"Doesn't lay right around the waist,  very boxy and stiff. I'm still washing trying to get it to lossen up. Not stretchy and smaller than labeled."
"Like many other reviewers, I couldn't even get my foot in the shoe because the hole is too small... and I have a narrow foot. Lousy design Merrell!"
Wasn't good at all the bangs don't hang to one side and you need to wear glasses to keep the hair outta your face. Another problem was how the ears look to make it look even and on top of your head your hair will show through no matter what
Doesn't stick well
The thumb hole is in a strange place and these are very thin and cheap feeling. Not very warm.
"I don't get the size or cut on this. I'm 5'10"", 195lb and have a 42"" chest. I got a medium thinking it was going to fit tight (the look I was going for). The medium could easily be a large or even extra-large. It fits more like a loose blouse. Will be returning it soon."
i am disappointed. the ca's are fake looking & one is very loose. I'm a size 7 & this ring is a bit too big. i would returning it but it was $20 so it's not really worth the $ to send it back.  :-(
"returned because of poor quality, in my opinion - never worn"
"This was a purchasing mistake.  There is no way this low quality wallet is worth the $95 price I paid.  I even looked on Trafalgar's website, and they are now selling this for $65, which is STILL too much.  I would be embarrassed to give this as a gift.  I do not recommend this product to anyone and will be returning my first item to amazon."
Son never wore them. Said they were uncomfortable and hurt his fett. Wasted my money
"UGLY , very cheap and cheesy looking, I ordered the green one and that one is 100 X better."
The fit was perfect however I was shocked to discover the loose threads from these briefs. The material is thin and transparent especially the black. It ripped from the time I tried wearing them. Unsure if I just happened to get a bad batch but I'm not happy about this.
pants ripped at the crouch within a month. You get what you pay for.
"What can I say?
They are lighter than regular Danskos, which was always the gripe I had with Danskos.
They seem quite sturdy.
I haven't replaced the removal inserts with orthotics, and I don't think I am going to. They are quite comfortable the way they are.
The pattern is very pretty, but they probably vary pair-to-pair.
At the end of a 12 hour ICU shift, my feet are barely even uncomfortable, let alone in pain.
I am digging them.
Wish they weren't so expensive, but I will probably order another pair eventually.
Lastly, I am right at a 7.5/8 and the 38s fit great, with the expected little gap at the back that should be there.

UPDATE after ONE month of ownership:
The up side is that the shoes are more comfortable than ever. The bad news is that coating/layer that has the pattern is cracking/tearing. I only wear them to work and I haven't done anything crazy with them. However, I had my $35 Cherokee WorkWear shoes for YEARS before they started cracking. It looks like someone took a tiny razor blade to the shoe. I am pretty disappointed. They are supposed to be better quality. I could have ordered another pair of Cherokees and save $100. If there was a way to upload a photo, I would, but I don't really have the capability to upload an adequate video at this time. Maybe I'll get around to it one day soon. I would consider a return, but unfortunately, I am ONE day past the return period. FYI, if you contact Dansko directly, they tell you to contact the retailer you purchased them from, so I guess I am stuck with them.

PS. I bought them in the Painterly pattern."
I bought these for my son playing JV soccer for fall. They fit as expected and were comfortable. Unfortunately they ripped out on the edges in less than 30 days.
"These are beautiful sandals.  I wear 8 1/2 and I ordered 8 since they didn't have half sizes.  Fit's fine!  9 would have been too big- and over time these type sandals loosen some anyway.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that they are not as comfortable to wear as last Vionics I got.  The arch is a bit to high, so my foot hurts after wearing them.  This is about my 4th pair of Orthaheels- vionic type sandals.  And this is 2nd pair that ARCH support is too high.  I need arch support- but it really DIGS into my arches- and who wants pain every time you wear?  But I can wear them for an hour or two ok, or much longer if not walking or standing a long time.  Hoping the stones stay in.  These are much prettier than my last pair, and looked great with a long sun dress I wore on Sunday afternoon.

UPDATE:  I'M HAVING TO LOWER TO 2 STARS, BECAUSE THEY LOOSENED UP ON MY FEET TO THE EXTENT THAT I CAN'T WEAR THEM LIKE I DID.  THE STRING THAT GOES BETWEEN THE TOES EDGED"""" OUT OF THE SHOE"""" SOME AND LOOSENED THEM WAY TOO MUCH TO BE COMFORTABLE ON THE FOOT.  NOW, THEY DON'T STAY ON MY FEET GOOD AND COULD ACTUALLY TRIP ME UP...I HAD ANOTHER PAIR THAT DID THAT.  I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER BRAND IF THEY ARE GOING TO ALWAYS DO THAT."
"They run somewhat small.  I was also expecting a more comfortable sock from Polo, and a slightly thicker sock as well.  It's paper thin and feels grainy."
"These shoes are way too big both in length and width.  I am sending them back.  I am afraid that a smaller size in length and width won't work but as long as I can return them, I will try a different pair.  Finding comfortable slippers is tough!!"
"I liked the watch, I thought it was well made, sturdy, and perfect for the tough work he does on our boats.  He just did not like it.  He still has not even put it on his wrist.  What am I to do?"
"I think that the price is way high for the quality.  I ordered the size indicated, and it was literally so big I could step into the corset and pull it up over my hips.  The skirt was flimsy material and looked terrible.  I wanted if for part of a costume, but I own actual, waist-cinching corsets, and some of them cost little more than this outfit did.  (I thought it was a dress, which was my error.)  That said, dealing with the seller has been great.  They are responsive and easy to deal with."
"Wrong color, too large, bad experience returning item. Item fits loosely for the smaller sizes. Color we received was more gray. Wish we had a receipt on the return, as they demand one a month later."
"I give it no stars but it forces you, if this is a REAL $400.00 Ivanka Trump coat then its sad that the snaps on my son's $10 garanimals coat. All its snaps and zippers are not just sewn IN proper they work. I'd this truly is her brand then I'd be embarrassed and I am embarrassed for her for the junk she is selling"
"ugly dark color, not like the picture"
The padding inside is really nice and comfy but the rest of the shoe is pretty tough on your foot and starts to irritate the back of my ankle and inside the shoe as well.
"Shorter then the photos. Low quality and after one month of gentle use, the seams falls apart."
very thin. Must wear something underneath. Plus the armholes are very small.
"I love midnight collection by CH, but the fabric on these is substationally thinner than usual and actually snagged on a piece of velcro on  my slipper (slippers I wear with all my CH)."
"Nothing extra long about the band. Worse, it came without directions."
"Fake looking. Looks like glass, not cut very well. Band is very thin and flimsy."
It was broken when it arrived. Otherwise it works well. I say that because I have another one
"I bought the black and white houndstooth with red trim. First off the red trim is actually like a deep wine red, almost burgundy, not the bright red you see in the picture. As other reviewers have mentioned it had a very strong plastic smell. I left it outdoors all night, sprayed it with fabreeze, and even put dryer sheets in it and still the smell didn't go away. I took it on my trip on the plane since it was the only duffle bag i had. The bag's best feature is all the pockets it has which came in handy. But after the trip i noticed one of the side zippers is already coming apart. I gave the bag away to charity and now looking for another one."
Did not fit as described on website. Top arrived in package that did not have the size indicated and it is not on a tag attached to top. I expected it to be longer and looser.
Material is not good..
"The shoes are cute but after a few times of wearing them the zipper in the back over a sudden started splitting open for no reason and now I can't wear them. Unfortunately I didn't wear them a lot right after receiving and I can no longer return them, otherwise definitely would"
Fit too tight across the instep.  i have a high arch and need to use a shoehorn every time I try to put them on.
Fabric covering around outsides of the slipper wearing away with less than a month of limited wear. Can't return them because return policy doesn't give allowance to return due to defects in the product. I'm out $18.00 with no recourse.  Acorn brands seem to be poorly made. Had problems with this brand before and hoped to give them another try/chance. 
Shoes look exotic. Not up to Poetic License snuff as far as materials. Leather is as stiff as a board. Will need time to break in or take to a shoe-repair shop to stretch. No give what so ever. Not surprised to find made in China. Disappointed in cheap quality of the leather. Could not wear right out of the box. Beware these shoes!!
"I am 5'10"" and thought I would like/need the extra length. I was wrong. These were way too long and I HATED the color. The company was very easy to deal with regarding a return."
My husband wears 32/32 these pants are not even close to being a 32/32. Way to small. We waited to long to return. So I will just donate these.
"Well it is 7 months into buying these things and little pieces are falling off. The overall structural integrity is still holding up very well. The laces are great and have held up. The comfort is average. As for breathability, you would be better off wrapping plastic bags around your feet. I believe these will last me another 5 months before I break down and buy shoes. I am done buying $100 shoes every year from China. I will buy some better made ones made in a non-asian country. Edit: After less than 8 months these shoes are disintegrating. The soles have entirely worn down and there is now holes in the bottom with my toes poking through. I will never buy another pair of Merrells again. Cheap Chinese trash!"
"I bought these for my mother, who has other woven Skechers in this size.  These were a full size too big and had to be returned."
Threw it out.
"Item came with hole in it. Not worth cost or dealing with hassle to return.

Fail."
"Unlike the short sleeve shirts, these are not slim fit."
These run small in the waist and the inseam is a little on the long side although I've found that to be an issue with all jeans and they vary depending on the manufacture. One other thing is that they are really heavy material. For me this is a negative because I'm not outside doing work all day. If you were and the temperatures were not summer-like then these may be exactly what you're looking for.
"Nice material and pattern, but I bought a 12-18 month size and it looked like a 3 month size.  No way does it fit my 12 month old nephew.  I am thankful for free returns."
"These fit close to the face and give off some weird color shading. They are OK, but I have had better."
Are these really Ray-Bans?  Imported?  No logo on right lens.
"Comfortable, but need to order a size bigger than what I normally wear, because the toes go too far back (which causes my heel to go farther back)."
Very thin and fall off easily.
"Tried this on a recent trip and ended up returning it.  Love the color - really cool and has the space age look and feel.  You really can store a ton of stuff into it.  Why the negative reviews?  Glad you asked:

I found that the wheels were ""off"" somehow.  Gliding this seemed WAY off, to the point of me just tilting it and carrying it on two wheels rather than using the 4 wheels.  In addition, the handle felt very flimsy when extended and often didn't lock into position.

As I knew having a glider suitcase that didn't glide and a handle that didn't feel sturdy on my first trip wasn't a good feeling.  I'm sure there are better made products out there so I'll continue to look"
"These are not yoga pants unless you want to give everyone a show. The fabric is very cheap and sheer. All is not lost though, I use them as tights under my skirts. That's about it."
I knew as soon as I took them out of the box they where to small. Beware they run very narrow. I had to give them away very sad.
"The size is smaller than it should be, and it is VERY bulky!"
Not even close to the right size. Small would be more like the size
"Ok, these get 2 stars only because the color is accurate. Nothing else about the picture meshes with the product we received. First of all, these are way too big for the average child! These are more like adult gloves. Not to mention the picture makes them look slim and streamlined, and very creepy...but in reality they are bulky and awkward! The fingers are short and stubby - not like what is pictured at all, and the wrist opening is huge! There is no way these would stay on any child's hand! Maybe if they're the offspring of Godzilla...and even then I'd be skeptical!

Are you laughing?? Yeah I was too when my 8 year old tried them on!

I was so disappointed with these gloves, esp because we had to scramble last minute to find something better!"
This is not a dress. Does not fit like in picture shown! Again small and made for a small teenager. Certainly not a dress!
"One of these shoes are defective  and not stitched correctly so the strap bulges out at the side and is very noticeable.  Unfortunately it was front a different vendor and fortunately, the other pair was perfect and fit beautifully."
Great shirt but runs really small.
Way too small! I ordered a size larger because of reviews but had no idea it would be that small so very disappointing I'm going to have to be returning it!
"Love the brand, fit varies"
"These seemed like a good idea but did not work for me. They do keep my pants buttoned, but my expanding pregnant belly also makes it difficult to zip my pants. Using these extenders increases the space between the buttons on my pants, making it even more likely that the zipper will fall down. These might work in very, very early pregnancy, but now that my belly is big enough to keep normal pants from buttoning and zipping, it is just time to move on to maternity clothing. I also found that the extenders are not adjustable enough, so they are either too loose or too tight."
"Was a little bit annoying that we couldn't pick the color.  The lock was cheap, a student that didn't have the combination just broke the lock with his hands and got in the locker."
Shoes looked nothing like the picture. Returned them.
"Definitely not skinny, more baggy than the picture. Rough and hard fabric is so low quality the red color dropped to dye a towel washed with it completely pink. The fly is a pain in the crotch to zip as if rusted."
"Magnet will not hold, it is so weak it barely even shuts.  When on my wrist (and it is NOT tight, very loose), it will not stay closed.  Also, not very wide,  color not as shown (I ordered the snakeskin, white/brown/black, and it is mostly dark & light brown, NO white at all).  Not even sure if it is real leather, the pouch that comes with it states ""Nappax"" but I don't know if that refers to the pouch or the bracelet.  Returning, going to stick to brand names!"
"Pretty bra, but it's too tight. Both the band and the cups are too small. I consistently wear a 34D in other brands, but can't wear this one!"
"Poor for swelling ankles. Even after cutting of the top and then cutting it more and more--down to the lettering, this anklet binds at the top. I like the compression in the arch which keeps the sock from slipping down into the shoe, but I wish they had a more comfortable top, which constricts the ankle swelling right in the middle."
"Lace on the bodice of the shapewear showed through clothing, and the bra had no covering--inserts/padding needed."
"I ordered my normal size, but they were too short and did not have any arch support.  I have high arches and need arch support due to all the walking I do."
"I always wear a size 39 or 40 in EU sized shoes. This is a 40. My other pair of Alegria Paloma 40's fit perfectly. When these arrived, they had an odor, so I allowed them to off-gas in another bedroom for a few weeks. Then I just wore them on a trip. The right shoe is too short, as if this pair is really a size 39. And my feet burn if I wear them too long. I guess they are never going to off-gas enough. I wish I could still return them. They are very cute, but terrible shoes for me. I love my other pair that are the same style, but a different fabric. And obviously cut better."
I would not recommend this bra.  Small fitting and not quality.
"I was impressed with the look and fit when I received the belt.  My first wearing supported the impression.  However, by the end of my second wearing to dinner out, 15% of the faux leather tab had flaked off, leaving ugly white spot where it flaked.  Upon further inspection, I could see the initial flaking was just the beginning. Obviously, it no longer looks nice/presentable."
So tiny. I could not believe how small they were and I have super small hands. Had to return and didn't bother reordering because I thought even the largest would be uncomfortable.
"These are fake Levis. The tags don't say Levi Strauss anywhere; the area is just left blank. I don't mind buying dupes as long as I actually am aware that I'm buying dupes before purchasing. However, I'm not willing to pay full retail price for a fake. This review is for the Wanderer wash."
Hurt my feet because I have a high arch
Messy glue everywhere... cheap looking
Ridiculous in fit
I thought that with the silicone strip in the heel that these would definitely stay in place; they don't! I can't make it down the block before they are half way off my foot and bunched up inside my footwear! More bothersome than help!
if you have a kid with strong legs - buy 505 instead! this is to tight even if you buy it 2 sizes bigger
"Cheap, small"
The hat fit ok and looked good at first but it actually started to wear at the top where I would grab it to take it off my head. Very disappointed. Wouldn't spend the money again.
"Very lightweight cotton material.  Not a big deal, but I wanted to add that to the review.  The main reason I'm only giving this 2 stars is that the artwork is printed crooked.  Not just a little, it's very obvious.  Since I only paid $10 for the shirt, I'm not returning it, but not something I'll be wearing out in public."
"Hello,
I had problems with sizes of this item.
XL-size was small to me. So, I reordered this item and got XXL-size.
The  surprise is that XXL-size was too small to me, smaller than XL-size."
Pants were too long after a wash they shrank horrible slacks
Ordered a toddler size 9 & they ended up being smaller then my daughters toddler size 8 shoes.
"Shoes are too flimsy, cheap material."
Spend the money and get one that has a velcro interior with a velcro inner belt.  This thing slides all over the place.
"These run a bit smaller than the asics 2170, look great but a little too tight compared to the 2170 in the same size."
"Cute, but heavy and very stiff back. Prefer my under armour one"
Looks very bad and cheap. Lace details don't lay flat and instead just stick out in all directions.
Not happy with this product
"I am so mad. I love the looks of the ring the feel of the ring. The stones started falling off and that made me sad, I had to throw it away."
"These shoes are so uncomfortable.  They do not fit well at all. With the sole, you might think they would be comfortable but I can not wear them at all and I want a refund but it is too late :("
Poor quality material. do not buy. It feels like the material used on a shower curtain. and its big NOT slim fit
"Couldn't get it over my shoulders, I'm 5'8"" and a size 10 but seriously! It was made for someone 5'2"""
"these shorts suck!  Most of the buttons have fallen off, the pockets are so thin my iPhone has worn holes in them.  I don't recommend them."
"After receiving the wrong size twice, I gave up and got a refund.  I know the product is a good one, because my husband wears them regularly.  However, the people filling these orders does not pay attention to detail."
There are different size charts was VERY disappointed it did NOT fit!  Not even close!
"These boot are amazing but I knocked down the rating one star because Bed Stu's sizing is so inconsistent. At first the 9's felt ok, but after walking around the house for 2 days the boots began to relax and felt way to big. I placed a different order for the 8.5's and I love these. I've purchased other pairs of Bed Stu boots before and that sizing was accurate. So just be careful when ordering.  Overall I am impressed by the look and feel of these boots. I highly recommend. I actually bought them in both colors. Both have a worn in distressed look which I like. It's also important to mention that the black boots are not a true black as shown in the picture. They are more of a faded black/gray color, but once again it is to give it that worn look.

**EDIT**
I probably should have deleted most of my previous review. I posted a picture of my actual boot in the photo section of this page. As shown in the picture after 2 weeks of very light use the glue is already coming off from the back of the heel. I take care of my products and so it was not due to mishandling (taking shoe off by pulling from the heel area). I'm sorry to knock down the score of what I thought was an awesome boot, but for the price the quality is not worth it. I may return the brown pair that I purchased."
"Its funny, but very low quality and thin.

The badge fell apart before I put it on."
"I am a small fit, like a 2 in American standards and the size ran even a little small for me. It also was not made very well, but hey I guess you get what you paid for right?"
"Good Fit. Good Seller. Thanks
Fit was OK - but these were or are very poor overalls.  must be seconds or thirds .
do no know how they ever got the Carhartt name on them."
I liked the look of the shoe.  I was disappointed that it did not meet the usual standard of sturdiness that I've had from Propet in the past.  I thought it was a poor value at the price for this reason.
"Cant even wear it, way too small"
"Just opened the box, and the belt buckle has spotting, makes the finish looks awful."
The socks I ordered were all white.  The socks I received have grey toes and heels. I don't like them but cost to much yo return.
"It does not fit as expected even with the new measurements provided by the merchant. They run really small. They recommended to buy M, I am a 34B now and it fit me really snug. I would recommend to size up, maybe even consider 2 sizes up."
"I guess either I got fatter or the Levi's got smaller. Since they started making there products out of country, there quality control has dropped.
Thanks Wall St."
No worth the price! Walmart has the same way cheaper!!!!!!
The shirt looks horrible! This picture on the shirt is literally a picture of another shirt with the Texas chainsaw massacre smdh. Wtf? That's not wht it looked like n the pic when I ordered it! Now my gift for my fiance was ruined!!! :(
"just kinda felt like itwas over priced for what i paid, and the ringshowed upsomewhat bent....all vad"
zero support for the bottom of the foot.  Son said there is nothing to cushion between foot and the floor.  He is not going to wear them.  He stands for work and hoped these could be used for that.  Under Armor shoes were much for comfortable and half the price
"I ordered the wide width but it was still too narrow to accomodate my custom orthotic.  Heavy, cluncky, and hot.  I returned it."
Smaller then I thought
These did not fit as expected and I returned them.  Why can't clothes fit universally?  One always is uncertain of the fit.  Some NYDJ jeans fit well and some do not and they are all the same size.
"The dress neckline was not as pictured. It was plain, it did not have the embroidered border, the zipper in back did not lay down. The jacket was nice, but the shoulder pads made me look like a linebacker. Sorry, but this one is going back."
Not the quality I expect from Hanes.  These are soo thin you can see through them.  Sons are wearing them with No complaints though because they are soft and do not have a tag in them or the scratchy elastic waist band.
Pockets cut too small. Difficult to insert or remove cards. Unusable as is.
Broke within two weeks.
it was to small had to cut around the ears wasted my money.
Pure worthless trash
Fair quality leather however their sizes are about 3 sizes off. Runs incredibly small in sizes.
so cheap
When I purchase same size and width from other manufacturer - they fit.  This brand does not.  They are larger then the sizes shown.
seems a lot smaller than size stated and made of cheap quality materials - not recmmmended!
"These are ""heavyweight"" versions and that makes them very stiff and uncomfortable as undershirts."
"I purchased a pair about 3 months ago and they already need to be replaced. and the size was wayyyyy too big. I love the flat hard bottom and style of the shoe, but come on 3 months!!! When I was younger(90's) I remember my sneakers lasting sooo much longer, with wayyy more abuse than I give these now. I would love to purchase another pair bc I do like them, but am torn bc I don't want to buy a new pair of sneakers every 3 months. Not sure where all the wear comes from bc I only use them for walking at work and strength training in the gym, nothing crazy just squats and deadlifts. will definitely look into purchasing something that is similar that lasts a lot longer. I recommend doing more research on similar shoes that last longer, This was just ridiculous."
"Looks really cheap, I don't like it much... and I returned it!"
"My husband liked the watch, but it didn't function at all. It was a big disappointment. Why wear a watch if it can't tell time?"
"I found these jeans have a chemical smell to them.  I decided to do a search on ""smelly jeans"" in the review area and found other people had the same problem. I also found the smell stayed in the jeans even after 2 to 3 washes.  So back they go.  I would advise others to not buy them as you do not know if the chemical smell is harmful."
"My husband went through two pairs of these in a matter of months. The mesh at the outer sides just rips terribly every single time, even though as far as fit and support goes, the shoe is excellent for my husband's running stride. Unfortunately, won't buy this shoe again because the construction is just low quality."
"This top is fairly comfortable to wear, but it is see-through! A maternity top should not be see-through, especially at this price. This top is perfect as far as the fit goes, so it is not see-through because it's tight/too small, its just really thin material. I wish the material was a little thicker. You can see the shadow in my bellybutton. How embarrassing when you're working out. I ordered the pink and the blue. The pink is more see-through than the blue. Overall, I would not recommend this top."
I am so not happy with this purchase! It's too big (crotch area) and it's too baggy (leg part).
"This tight is running small, be careful about that, you need order largest size they have .I order X large for my 15years old, weight 96lb. Still too short.but this tight is very flexible! Maybe there is the reason to run short. And seller don't accept return."
"I wear 5X so I purchased two 5XL and got one 4XL by mistake but it fits me better than the 5XL which is just too large. You can take one size down and still be sure there's still a lot of room. The material and workmanship doesn't seem too good also, I doubt it'll hold up to many washes."
My husband loved the short but it was kind a little bit big because my husband real waist size is 34
This a purse not shoes! It was not very nice looking and damaged. I had to return it.
Boxy fit. Not very long.
My husband was very disappointed with these men's classic woven tartan boxer shorts. He likes his legs long and the legs on these shorts were cut at the top of the thigh. I think the picture is deceiving. We sent them back but not because they were a bad product. They were no what we thought they would be. When viewing items there should be more detail.
The pants were to small in the waist.  I did not like the quality of the fabric.  I will be returning the pants.
It's going back. Large and strap broke before trying it on.
Way Way WAy WAY too narrow
I normally wear a 3XTall in Carhart sweatshirts but this sweater is to big and on top of that I was expecting it to be thicker its to thin to keep you warm in the winter the FIRST ITEM THAT I bought from Carhart that was a disappointment
"I'm a 40B, which is a weird size. I was excited to find a strapless bra in my size, but unfortunately it didn't fit at all. The strap seemed to be a proper 40, but the cups were like a C/D."
These sandals are not comfortable. Don't care for the adjustable straps as they seem to not keep their adjustment. Feet kept slipping forward while walking.
"Very tight for the size. The cup size was perfect, but goes too high on your chest to wear with my strapless wedding gown, so I can't use it."
"This is a cute bracelet, but not real silver. Pics below of how it looks after wearing it one month."
"These are not for snowy winter activities....they are for 30-40 degree days going shopping or around town.  IMO they do not work well as liners. I have a pair of liners that are cheaper, warmer, and thinner so you can move your fingers better.

I was very disappointed with them."
Does not match up with size chart
Came with stain they did nothing about it don't buy
"I ordered size 9, and it has never been too large.  These slid on my heels and seemed big all over. I sent them back."
"I'm tall and relatively thin,  ordered size 6/tall.  They ""fit"" like a 10/tall.  Considerably larger than most brand's 6.  I would have been happy to try again, however the smallest size offered is 4, and that is not available in tall."
So this is a mens leather bracelet. You would think being a mens product it would fit a man but its not even close. I cant even buckle it around my wrist and I am a normal sized male. My wife loves it and I wasted my money.
"I understand that underwire is not supposed to be comfortable or fun to wear. But this is crazy. The wire at the bottom part isn't too bad, but the part near your underarm/armpit makes it impossible to put your arms down without having pain in the underarm. (The top part, near underarm goes up way higher than the picture shows. It is truly up to the armpit.)"
"I want to like these boots, especially because the grey color was only $50 when I bought them. But there are a few things I'm not thrilled about. Most troublesome, the soles do NOT last. After one season of wear, the ""wood"" patterned fabric or whatever it is around the sides of the heel is peeling off and the sole is wearing through to white plastic underneath. I'm going to try to get them repaired, because the leather upper seems to be of good quality. But the soles are not great. For that reason, I would not pay more than $50.

Style-wise, I love the oxford/wing tip look. They are a bit pointy, so they make my feet appear longer. But I am only a size 7 and I don't mind THAT much if my feet look a little bigger--but if this is a concern for you, you may not like the look of these.

Fit wise, they run narrow and tight across the top. My heels are narrower and my ankles are thin, so I actually really like that my feet don't slide around in these. My feet are wider at the toes, but I found that the leather has stretched a bit with wear to accommodate this."
The sandals are not made well sew-in closure has a projecting hard clump of leather around the big toe
"Bottoms were ok, but the tops always kill me. It's a 2X and the cup size looks to be able the size of a training bra. Besides not having any support, it has no cup. I was disappointed because i like the look for the suit, but it's a joke on the top if you have higher than a A/B cup."
very narrow and uncomfortable.  ended up returning them.
Poor quality clothing. I don't know for sure if its commensurate to the price.
"While this is a nice band, it is just a silly mm over 22 so it doesn't fit my Citizen watch, as a result the band was for me effectively useless."
"Ordered size 0-3 months but they were more like premie size. Amazon was great about the refund but I hope this product sizing get corrected or something. Other than the size being off the onesies were okay, just basic cotton onesies."
The shoes are cute and convenient that's why I give it 2 stars but they are way too small for the size that they say it is. I normally wear a 9.5 or 10 so I ordered an 11 just because I knew it would probably be small but these are really small its almost unbearable to wear.
"The hat in the picture looks way nicer than what I received. I know, I know, it was only $1.50, but if it looked like what it did in the picture, I would have been happy. The stitching on the hat is absolutely horrible. In every place, the stitching is sloppy and there are lose threads everywhere. I was set to give this as a little gift for Christmas, but I was so embarrassed by the quality, I opted to crochet a hat instead.

I wouldn't buy this, period. The quality is just that bad."
Hard to know what colors one will be receiving since photo and quantity and description don't match. We received 4 translucent colored ones and a solid neon pink. I wish they were all solid colors so they are easier to distinguish.
"Tops are too tight and uncomfortable. Love the designs and colors, but can't wear them"
On the back of the watch says resistant of water and I wear my watch when I did dishes and now the watch is not working :(:; so I don't like it
Fell apart in less than a day! So cheap and hurt my child's feet.
The shorts themselves were ok. The problems started to happen when you go to use the draw string. Talk about cheap. I broke the string on both pair of shorts. Just from tying them. I replaced it with paracord. Im not sure that I would buy again.
"Too small.. I should've paid close attention to the measurements. It'll do but not what I was expecting at all. It does have the 3 compartments and looks exactly as the picture shows , color and all. It's okay just really small."
"For someone who wears a medium, this extra large is too small?"
Most of my earring backs wouldn't stay on this unless earrings were very small...returned it.
"I'm 6'2"" and 230 Lbs and don't think my dreams would fit in the largest size."
"I wouldn't buy these again. The first time my husband wore them the back pocket ripped! They are cute but cheaply made, which is surprising for dickies."
"Was beautiful, up until it started to leave a greenish-black ring around my ankle...."
"It fits large,the fabric is not very good, disappointing, not worth it"
It came squished glat in a box making the cups pointed intead of round......very hard to get round shape back :(
Buckles broke within a week of use. They held through the snow for a while but when they broke... Snow started coming in everywhere
very cheap.. maybe worth $2... certainly not $10-15
This scarf is very very thin! It will work as a fashion accessory but not great for cold weather.
They're cute but they don't last long. The shoes start to wear out after a few wears.
these shrink with each washing - now uncomfortably tight!!!
I purchased these boots on November 22nd 2014. Today after only 8 months I noticed the stitching is coming apart on the inside of both soles. I usually buy Justin boots but there is no way I am going to buy another pair when they fall apart in 8 months.
"What can I say about rhinestone embellished low heeled shoes with a Velcro closure? It's not the fault of the shoe, the came as advertised, I'm just 50 years too young to wear them, totally my bad for buying them and I deserve all the teasing I received from my girlfriends. Just don't, ok? No offense to the shoes."
"fits good, fast shipping, this is better than the har net that came with my wig. It holds all my hair in good and helps the wig stay on better.  Glad it was a two pack too--bonus!"
cute but way too big for a small boy.
These are very very short from armpit to waist. Impossible to tuck in for school uniforms. Had to throw them away.
"Was too tight for a buff (somewhat chunky) dude like me. I usually wear a medium (5'10"" 185ish), and this was just a little too tight to be appropriate for me."
Band tire apart after one week
The bra rides up because of a lack of elastic at the bottom and straps keep coming loose.
Did not at all work for me ! Terrible plastic odor and without lubricant and two shoe horns impossible to put on if your feet aren't narrow and two sizes smaller than what you order !
"They look nice. But by the end of the day, your feet will be cold and wet. There's nothing whatsoever to wick away moisture. Even with thick socks, you'll have wet feet by the end of the day.  You may want to invest in imagers. The inserts on board, curl up at the ends and get stiff and weird. Wouldn't buy again."
Very pretty but very poorly made.  Fell apart after 1 week of wearing it.
Confortable shoes but they are not for wide feet
Not at all comfortable. Strap between toes is painful when walking.
"Unfortunately the padding around the hooks is too thin and by the third or so wearing, I felt like holes were being bored into my back."
"I accidentally ordered a few of these instead of the LL turtlenecks. Although the material is nice each one literally came with a different neck! Some had necks that were too tight and a couple had puckered seams on each side. I kept only one which was ""normal"" for a turtleneck. It's  bad bc the color selection is nice. But these are all going back which is a big hassle!"
very small and they wouldnt let me return them
Disappointed! Way too much length in the straps. Doesn't stay on my 3.5 yr old daughter's head.
Cheap made the crystals fell out within the week.
"Awful dress! The sleeves are enormous, the armhole even bigger-makes you look like a bat! Honestly I think they photoshopped the dress on the model because it doesn't look anything similar. My waist disappeared and I looked like I was wearing a sack. I followed their size chart. Don't waste your time on this disaster."
The medium pants are really a large or extra large.  The medium shirt seems true to fit.
Be careful with this product inner pieces came off within a month of use
Not attractive at all and too large.
Do not buy! I don't know how this would fit anyone but a child and I ordered the largest size
Gave to a friend instead of returning it
I ordered an extra large and it fit like a Medium and was skin tight!  Not loose as pictured.  Formfitting like a girdle!
this are more for women then men
"the color is great, it looks great, just it's too big, I returned it"
"Does anyone ever own any such underwear that doesn't try to roll up your thighs??? Every so often, I'm tricked into trying this style again. Sure enough, they always roll up. Gross."
The right shoe plastic digs into my foot making it very uncomfortable after about 30 min of wearing. Bought a version without the plastic on the outside.
"I really wanted to love this bra, I liked the material and how the lace at top was stretchy and created a nice shape, however how the wires are done made it impossible to wear with out having the wires become VERY uncomfortable. I even tried going up a size to see if that would help... no such luck. Its too bad the wires are designed so poorly, I really liked everything else about the bra."
"This skirt is nothing but 25 cents worth of cheap, thin fabric, sewn to a strip of wide elastic.  It looks like something made in a children's sewing class.  It will either go to costume use or be donated to Goodwill.  It's pure garbage."
No ha sido entregado todav&iacute;a
Very small and tight. Nylon zippers broke. They smell bad and there is a warning on the box saying the material used to make them have been known to cause cancer. Also warned pregnant women not to wear them.
Much smaller than is depicted.
"Great looking shoe, however, it was too large. I usually take 9 wide, perhaps for this style I needed a smaller size. I returned the shoe."
"Ordered 2 sizes up and still doesn't fit. Not impressed with quality either, returning."
"LOVE the boot - LOVE it! But I didn't get it from Amazon, I got it from Zappo's. I originally purchased it from Amazon in the size I typically wear (8-1/2 wide). The boot was too big. Amazon wouldn't allow me to order the exact same book in a smaller size without paying an additional $50 because I purchased it during the Black Friday Sale. The Amazon site said that it would give a FREE exchange or refund, at the time I had placed my order. I wanted the FREE exchange but ended up with the FREE refund. So disappointed with Amazon. Ended up purchasing the exact same boot in the size I needed (at the Black Friday Sale price) from Zappo's. The Easy Spirit Women's Jimlet Wide Calf Riding Boot is a beautiful and comfortable boot. The boot is an all leather boot with none of that ugly stretchy material. Read one complaint that it didn't ""smell"" like leather; I didn't purchase it for my nose - I purchased it for the style and comfort of an ALL leather boot. Wish Easy Spirit would make the Jimlet wide calf in a camel color, I would buy it too! I know it comes in a brown but that color is too close to the black for me."
Much smaller than what it says on the package.
Returning.  Material is too thin and it's not long enough in the back.
"Nothing like the picture shown. Received today and when opened it was very frizzy, super curly and not shaped as shown. It looks the wig had a bad perm that's fading out. The picture demonstrates soft waves, not small spiral curls and since it's so curly the length barely goes past the shoulders. Very disappointed, 5yr old was looking forward to this wig for her Halloween costume party at school. As a hair stylist there isn't much you can do with the wig without damaging and causing more frizzyness/knotting.  Returning item."
the shoes are very small
The quality is simply not there. I received my product with poor stitching and threads coming loose from multiple sites. I'd rather get a Walmart bag for the same quality at a much lower price. Already returned mine before my hiking/camping trip to Mt. Rainier starts next week.
"This were horrible...the bottom is NOT made of leather..some kind of hard plastic...they sent this in a bag, no box, terrible way to ship product, came to house all smashed and twisted up."
Very small. The material is cheap and the packaging was awful. Rolled up in a plastic bag.
BOUGHT THESE SUNGLASSES- THOUGHT THEY WERE A GOOD PRICE SINCE MOST SUNGLASSES ARE AROUND $10. WELL THESE ARE THE SAME PRICE AFTER SHIPPING SO NOT AS GOOD A DEAL AS I THOUGHT. tHEY BROKE AFTER NOT EVEN HAVING THEM FOR 24 HOURS. THEY ARE CUTE BUT...... DONT-- WASTE --YOUR-- MONEY!!!
"The only way heat was felt was if it was flush against the skin, but that didn't work unless the shirt was a size or two smaller than comfortable."
"Didn't order the correct size, returned it."
For me the shoes were too short so I am sending them back for refund. I would get a larger size but they don't have a larger size. Cute shoe just didn't fit me. Team big foot over here.
"Runs way too small, like 2 to 3 sizes too small. I ordered an extra large and it would fit my daughter...who wears a small"
This is not something to be used by big guys.  I wanted to use it for travel to and from the hospital but it is made more for a woman so I gave to my sister..  Not a guy bad in no way shape or form.
The material has next to no stretch to it. 3 pairs that I can't wear. The material seems very breathable but they're tight around the legs and have no give.
Doesnt look like a cat. The ears are small and just weir looking
gave away - too small
"Horrible quality, ripped the first time I put them on. Also the legs only came up to my knees. I'm 5'8. And the belt part had very little elasticity and wouldn't stay up"
My son refuses to wear this. It is huge and the tail part of it is so very long. The front bill isn't quite structured enough so it falls a bit into my son's face. It has never once been worn out of the house. I assume other kids might wear it and in that case it would protect the neck and shoulders.
"Bought this in July. Tried it on, loved it. Finally got around to wearing it this week in the cooler fall weather and realized it has a few pinholes in the sleeve... so disappointed as it is past the return period. Tons of compliments on it, just not sure how it will hold up now."
very narrow and small.  i ordered a 1/2 size up and still did not fit.
"Oh man, I was so bummed with this purchase. :( I purchased for a wedding. I read the reviews and everyone seemed very happy with their purchase. Even the pictures they shared were beautiful. I like the infinity gowns because they are so versatile. Unfortunately..... the material is super thin and see-thru!!!!! Like see EVERYTHING! My nipples, under ear, cellulite, everything. I even had purchased the petals to cover your nipples specifically for this dress. But you could see the entire petal! Just ridiculous to me...how could anyone where this? You can't wear a bra with straps OR without, I even tried putting the pads that come in bathing suits over my boobs but that didn't help either. I accidentally ordered two of these dresses....... sooooo what I did was I put one dress on over the other. Now that was perfect. Only problem was that you had A TON of access ""strap"" material at that point and obviously made the dress heavier. I plan on customizing this dress so that I can use it in the future. So I will just double up the skirt and boob fabric and cut off the extra material on one."
First off let me start by saying its described as high waisted it looks more like a brief. The top is ill fitting with no cup support or padding or extra material your breast will be exposed easily.
Very disappointed in this shoe.  It is hard...no other way to describe it.  Even with my own insoles the shoe is just too rigid.  There is no give in the forefoot and it feels like I am stomping around.
seem of poor quality and are not like the photo does not the recommend
"Tips about it
Day and week day features make it worthy, although too lite and slightly small for men.
Too much highlighted colours. Seems to have Fragile rubber bands"
Had to return. Was too narrow for me.
I was looking for a not huge backpack for my 7 yr daughter. It says it's a lightweight one. So I may misunderstood and thought it's not that huge. I got it and it's just sooooo big on the back of my daughter. And there is no any pocket inside. Very unconvenient.
"i like Reebok's Easy Tone shoes with 2 ""pods"" i walk everywhere (small town) the pad inside was very soft but it felt like you were putting on 2 pairsz of shoes at once. I did not like them. I've been wearing Reeboks 10yrs straight"
Crap. Didn't last the whole school. Broke completely apart. Too back the quality didn't match the beautiful design of the backpack.
had turn other color.
"Very disappointing. Cheap thin metal, stone almost looks plastic and fake. Looks like costume jewelry. The chain looks like something you'd get out of a quarter bubblegum machine. More for the fit of a child-short and tiny, tiny clasp with barely anything to hold on to.  I bought the cuff bracelet too-too bad for me. Tried returning, past return date. Definitely not worth the money."
"Crap. Didnt fit, wayyy too small and stiff. I returned them"
"Returned it, was not comfortable for me"
"I ordered a size larger than my normal size leggings, following the size chart. The leggings fit, but are a poor quality. They are so thin; they're almost transparent in places. I'm so disappointed because the print looked awesome online and in the package."
It's made of cheap plastic.
"First off. This brand is amazing. The shoe itself is very comfortable and gorgeous! I love them. The reason I am giving 2 stars is that the inner lining of the slipper, less than a month later has come apart from the shoe inside near the toes. And is now exposing the foam inards of the shoe. Its now rather uncomfortable to have that fabric flapping around and my toes rubbing that plastic foam stuff underneath. Im pretty crafty but I have no real way to repair this because of the location of the seperation. Im going to look for a warranty. Hopefully they will fix this and increase my rating."
Returned. I own two paors of Alina jeans. Fit on this one was terribly small.
These socks are fine from the ankle down but terrible from the ankle up. All the elastic is shot. I buy socks 20 at a time and they are all bad. They don't even stay up any more. I wouldn't buy them again.
"Don't waste your money on this. The fit it too small and the material does not stretch. It is very tight in the diaper area with the snaps not staying snapped. I have a 10 month old son and the 12 month size was too small. In addition, the company, Mud Pie, has all of these stupid return restrictions. You have to have ""ALL the TAGS ATTACHED or NO REFUND""...seriously, stop it with the all caps in your instructions. They make it nearly impossible to return the outfit. I hate greedy, grumpy companies like that, especially when you never have used the outfit and it was just a sizing issue. Save your money...."
"Too small, defective. Loose thread all over the gloves."
Not very comfortable.  I ordered some Saucony two years ago and they were so comfortable.  Not what I expected.
They don't stay in your ears :/ Too heavy.
"Today was a first and only day I put these shoes on - and it will be the last one indeed.
Poorly, ill designed product, horrible sole that twists feet with every step - I wish I tried it on sooner - now I can not even return it.
REALLY BAD PRODUCT.

P.S. And that is not even getting to the part where I will have to say that ""leather"" looks like cheap plastic they use for packaging and it shines just the same, and smell... OMG!

Have to admit - that is my first ever Stacy Adams and I will happily get back to Cole Haan and Allen Edmonds - as always you get what you paid for..."
"I ordered the Rainbow Pride laces for my daughter, expecting them to be neon colored rainbow like pink/blue/lime green, as that is what the photos show. They arrived and are Primary rainbow colors, which do not match her shoes."
"These are ok. The touch part works, but they aren't as quick as another pair I have. They also aren't very warm. The top layer has no warmth. And they aren't good for driving... Would not recommend."
"I have very large breasts, so I ordered the version of this bra that says it fits larger cup sizes (G/H/I/etc). What they don't mention is that the band that goes around the body is also HUGE. Just because someone has large breasts does not necessarily mean they are huge around the rib cage!"
Didn't like it. Not as pretty as image.
The boots were too large. They will definitely fit someone needing a large wide boot. I need to return these.
"I can't write review on actual shoes because I never received them (even though I purchased them)!!!! Wanted to rate 0 stars!!! This seller (company Shoe Metro) is very unprofessional and you will be highly upset, like myself, when you don't get your shoes due to them being supposedly ""out of stock"" (at least that's what they emailed me and told me after i had already ordered them 4 days ago)!! I had purchased them for a cheap price (was extremely happy) and i suppose they didn't want to sell them to me for that price so they told me they were ""out of stock"" but there is still 2 left in stock!!! And they jacked the price up!!! I will never buy from them again!!! I was going to buy more of these shoes but in different colors if i liked the ones i ordered but they did me wrong and i want to forewarn you all and buy from another seller/another brand!!!"
Fell apart week after return window closes
"Incredibly small for large chested women, even for a D cup.  It fit more like a C cup."
"seem to be warm, but sounds like crinkling plastic over my ears when wearing them.  not worth the price at all, since 180s were only a few dollars more.  but they are still functional, and will donate them to someone that can use them that is in need."
Followed the instructions and still was misshaped metal is way to soft.
can't return this so make sure you really want this item!  I thought the perfectly shaped silicone would be a nice addition but it didn't match up and just looked weird
"I have a very small wrist so this was enormous on me- it was probably a good 4 inches too big. Not enough to make one more wrap, but enough for it to be dangling from my wrist in a most obnoxious manner. If it hadn't had the studs I could have just shortened it by punching a hole somewhere else in the leather, but the studs and extra trim piece made that impossible. Returned."
"Wow--these boots may have finally convinced me to give up on this brand. I had hoped to find a stylish, COMFORTABLE navy boot/bootie--and these were not it for me. The materials felt cheap, and the sole not only lacked padding as mentioned by others--it actually felt bumpy and defective and certainly uncomfortable. They also looked a bit dowdy. For this price point and this brand--way below the caliber and quality of materials and construction than should be the case. Packed up and back in the box within less than five minutes of opening. : - ("
"the shape is weird, it is too big on the shoulders, and fits tight on the hips..."
found these to be too small
The canvas is too thin to engage the buckle correctly.  I will spend more money for better function next time.
"its not a money clip, its more like a wallet or bigger than a wallet, so bulky due to the middle metal part

TRY another product before buying this"
"I decided to write this review because I have begun to notice that the waterproofing on Columbia shoes (that are built similar to this design) lose their water proofing layer rather quickly. This is my 4th pair of Columbia's, and I really like the design of the shoe, as well as how well they fit and feel right out of the box. The issue I have with them is that after about 4 or 5 months of continuous use the waterproofing starts to go (usually at the toe due to the flexing). This is a consistent issue and bothers me quite a bit. I believe it may be due time for me to spend a little more money again on some goretex fabric shoes, as my experience with a previous pair of Solomon GTXs went well (2 years before the shoes began to absorb water). The waterproofing with goretex seems to outlast these generic ""waterproof"" shoes by a marginal amount, and I do not enjoy spending money on something that must be replaced more often than should be. This being said I do realize that nothing lasts forever, but the waterproofing could at least last a year at the minimum? I do not think I am asking for much."
I was waiting for this in the mail and it looks nothing like pic the design and fabric is like some wall paper print paperuah material don't waste ur money
"I wear a size 8 1/2 to size 9 shoe.  So, I ordered size 9 and they were way too small (the fur lining). I tried for over a month to
get them to stretch to no avail.  When I called Uggs to send them back, I was told I had waited too long so I couldn't get a refund
or a larger size.  That was $100.00 I'll never see again and I will NEVER recommend Uggs to anyone - ever."
"Necklace broke the second time my daughter put it on.  Cute, but disappointing.  Chain can't be fixed, must be replaced."
"I've bought these comfortSoft by Hanes kind for years and I'll tell you that they're NOT the same. I have some in my drawer that are a few years old. The material is altogether different. Not as soft. It's almost has a rough feel to it and no where near as thick and dense as they use to be. The band around the waist is smaller too and the stitching.... well of lesser quality. Totally disappointed in over all quality compared to these when they came out some years ago. Checkout my photo and you can see the band width, stitching and material itself are inferior."
"My other birkesntocks, the traditional ones - fell apart in less than 7 months. Thought these would hold up better in a garden environment but my lord are they unfortable to wear. My feat don't get sweaty against the hot plastic shoes but they hurt your feet after a few hours, then your legs, low back, etc. By lunch time you might as well be wearing a hospital gown, because you my friend are going to the chiropractor.

Let me make this clear, these are NOT the traditional ""orthopedically friendly Birkenstock"" shoes.

Plus they look like crocs, UGLY!"
These shoes run extremely large.  They would have been great if they weren't so badly out of size calibration.  I usually wear Kenneth Cole shoes so its not that I'm not familiar with them.  The others are all the right size - this one was a full inch or more too long and they were also too broad.  Other than the size issue they'd have been great.
I have been wearing Hilfiger Briefs for years and they were great but the material seems very thin and cheap and the size is terrible and they shrink up stay away.
"though I love bamboo sandals, but this buy was definitely inappropriate as they cut from the first use."
I just adjust the size is smaller than normal.
"I purchased some of these jeans,  the same size as normal just like I have done every year for years.  This year,  the fit and size is different.  They are MUCH too small.  I have heard other people complain that it depends on which country they are manufactured in and that there is no consistency in sizing from Levi.  I returned them and have switched to a different brand."
looks nothing like the picture.
Neck opening was huge. Shirt was horrible. Notice they don't list where it is made. It is made in CHINA. If I knew this I would never have purchased. I returned item. Nice you want a USA shirt and they sell one made in china and do not let you know. We do not need to support China any more they we have
Horrible product! Is not even close to the picture when ordering. Do not buy this wig! Junk! It's a big glob.
These will not stay up!
"The description says that it is 100% cotton, but the fabric is very thin and not soft. They shrunk after one wash, and the fabric still doesn't feel soft. The only things I like about this product are the colors, pattern, and that it was delivered promptly. Do NOT recommend this product."
"very lightweight.  they are supposed to be the same size, but one is definitely smaller than the other. would not buy again."
"The ""glitter"" in these stockings made them very itchy and I returned them."
"Not what was expected, entirely to small."
"Ordered size 11, normal width. The sides stretched out quickly. Within 2 weeks, the shank (part of the shoe that runs down the length of it, for stability) broke, and clicked with every step. The cushion was gone within a month. The shoe laces came undone at least 2 times during an 8 hour shift. Paid $75, don't waste your money, spend a little more and get a decent shoe."
"I couldn't even think about wriggling into these, they were so tiny. Nice product though, but ordering one size up was not nearly enough."
"Like the reviewer with the orange nail polish who posted the images [which, by the way, are of her $79 Levenger case (see the brand embossing on the last photo), NOT this one], I have owned a high-quality leather Levenger case for the past 20 years - the zipper gave out just this month. I purchased this ""Winn Leather"" one, thinking I would save a few bucks. Bad choice! Absolutely NOT leather, and very poorly made: shiny plastic; seams not aligned (as seen in photo of *actual* product). Returning this one, have already purchasing another Levenger case - hoping it will last another 20 years! p.s. I have no affiliation with Levenger - just love the quality of their brand."
"Western Chief company does not stand behind anything purchased on Amazon - you must deal with Amazon.
Some of these boots are defective, and the rubber gives way at what would be the seam of toe and body - then the rubbber just flaps in the wind, exposing the very thin fabric lining underneath. The company is not interested in seeing the defective product, and reviews on Amazon for various products document this as an ongoing problem (which somehow I missed prior to ordering our own). Yet the company is not interested. Tells you a lot. . . . . caveat emptor."
"Terrible, don't bother! They completely stretched out after a couple of times wearing them. Such a waste of money."
Smells horribly of plastic and chemicals! They look nice though. I have a short torso they came up to right under my breasts. The compression felt nice against my stomach since I just had a baby.
The slots for the cards are to small. It is an effort to get them out every time needed. Would no recommend.
The shorts were cool...the top has no support...we NEED support...LOL
Seriously this is orange. Light orange like peach. It is no way pink like in the photo.
"To touch this feels like a good quality product, the material feels relatively thick and substantial with a smooth finish. It is slightly stretchy too. It's also well packaged, coming in a thick ziplock bag, with card inside to keep everything nearly folded.

I bought this as an undervest, and despite going up a size (based on other reviews) it's still pretty tight - OK for the purpose I have, probably not for wearing just as a t-shirt.

However, for some reason the t-shirt has a really off-putting smell not unlike burning plastic. Strongly chemical, very unpleasant industrial smell. I'm going to wash it and see but I have to say that this initial impression does not inspire much confidence about how this was made. Not sure I want to wear something tight to my skin that smells like this."
"Looked like a nice flat brim hat.... Wrong! Material was right, but my fat head (7-3/4) bairly fit, and a little bit of swet this sucka shrunk some. When i first put it on the brim wouldnt stay flat, it looks better in the trash now."
Poor Quality. Had to change my costume plans last minute. The bangs were really short and dopey.
No doubt these are well made and durable - for me however the material on the top was too tight and uncomfortable. This may be because I have a wide foot.
"This suit is almost perfect.  The fabric is soft yet colorful and seems sturdy.  The fit is fine.  The pockets are great for carrying around the basics as needed.  But... it stains easily.  And without any obvious sign of wear the stains come from.  Being synthetic fabrics, I wouldn't expect rust-colored dots (on the front right leg) after the first machine washing, but that's what I got.  (Nothing else in the wash, and none of my other clothing, has these stains.)

So it's almost perfect, but the unexplained, seemingly permanent, stain reduce the effective lifespan of this short."
"These are not bikinis;  they are briefs. I was very suprised when I received these. I chose my correct size, but they were huge!"
Putonghua it on broke
Belt clips will not stay in place. Returned.
did not it to big.
Wasn't the same dress as pictured.
"These pants are made from a very thin stretchy material, as many colorful jeans now usually are.  I got a size 7; I usually wear between a size 5 and 7 in juniors because I have a big butt.  These pants fit nicely and are quite flattering and form fitting.  They DO stretch.

HOWEVER the black rinse has an awful chemical smell to it.  I had read reviews before purchasing them and found that other people had the same problem.  I figured I'd try them out anyway.  I've washed them countless times and the smell won't go away.  I've let my friends smell them straight out of the wash and they've also smelled it.

Somebody else in the reviews says they got the smell out by soaking them in vinegar, so maybe I'll try that.

But if you plan on buying these and ignoring the reviews of the stench like I did, you may want to look elsewhere (I suggest Old Navy, their jeans don't smell in my experience) first.  Because the reviews ARE true.  The stink won't go away."
"Heavy shoe and no one...no normal person... Can get their foot in the ankle opening. Sorry. They have great rugged look, though."
This is awful and asbestos would be more comfortable.  It is the first item ever I am going to try to return.  The inside really is red [I thought that was a dress in the photo] but the kicker is no buttons at all - and three raccoon looking tails on the back like if Mullet is your hair style you may really love this.
Not very good with quality . Doesn't work and doesn't fit either waste of money even if it was only a few dollars. Your better of investing in a more expensive one that will actually do what it's supposed to
Cute shoes but very narrow. Had to give them away
"Buy wrapping horn in leather, it makes it more difficult to put a shoe on, when compared to bare metal or plastic horns."
The silicone rubber strap is nice. My package did not include the 2 pins. Had to use old ones. And I do not think my wrist is overly large but I use the last hole when putting it on. Could be a little longer.
Runs small and shorter than I would like.
These jeans run waaay to small!!!
I gave these to my friend who weighs less than 100 lbs. They fit her fine. I could not even get them on. (Size 8-10 pants normally)
This bag had an unpleasant smell and the leather  was in bad condition.
NOT HAPPY WIT IT
The shirt isn't nearly as cute as pictured. I originally got an XL because of the other comment left but then switched to a medium. It is maternity but its really wide like old style maternity shirts used to be. I'm a fan of the form fitting maternity shirts that accentuate the belly not try to hide it. I had high hopes for this and really wanted the shirt to look as pictured but was super disappointed to fine out otherwise. Will be returning the medium one as well. :(
Bottoms and sides tore after 2 weeks of light use. I'm talking really light use. You get what you pay for. Threw away and bought an under armour bag.
"I've bought other Carter's clothing and they don't usually feel so cheap. This one felt cheap and it also ran way too small. My baby wears other Carter's 12 month old clothing, but this was SO TIGHT. So basically it runs small and is cheap. :("
The product is ripped and I can't return it. Very disappointed.
"The arch of these shoes is in a weird place.  I forgot that I'd tried these on at DSW and that they just wouldn't work for me no matter which size I tried on.  I won't forget again.  Also?  I like Mary Janes that have a toe box that comes across the top of my foot a little closer to my ankle.  These cut right across the ball of my foot and yes, folks, I have to overshare - I have a small bunion on my left foot usually dictates no tight seams/edges in that area.  These hurt my right foot, as well, though, and there's nothing wrong with my right foot.  I'm pretty disappointed since JBU is made by Jambu and is supposed to be a less-expensive, comfortable version of casual shoe that I can wear with a skirt.  Since Keen quit making my favorite Mary Jane style, it's back to the drawing board for me once again. :-/"
it was broken
"Bought as birthday present, first night worn at dinner center gem falls out, was able to locate it and put it back in and tightened both.. very next day both gems fall out again. Very poorly made now shoes are useless with missing gems. And missed return deadline due to them being a gift"
The shoes too dirty and looks very old. Lots of stain and scratch. The sole of shoe has some dimple
Super uncomfortable and scratchy.
Lee jeans are the only jeans I wear. I ordered the same size I have been wearing for years. I bought a pair a few weeks before and they fit just fine. These jeans were so small I couldn't get them over my hips. I tried another pair of the same size and style from a different store. Same problem.
"It's a good looking knock off .  It is definitely fake.  The zipper doesn't glide like it's supposed to,  its actually hard to zip and unzip,  I read about telling a counterfeit from a real Coach purse on the Coach website.  This purse is definitely fake.  But honestly it was hard to tell."
"Super small. Material is very, very thin."
"Fabric is of rather poor quality, may be Ok for the price.  Seam had failed to capture fabric in the front of the dress. So I am going to return it."
Pretty jacket but run small!!
"Im not impressed by this sweatshirt at all. To begin, its more of a thick T-shirt than a sweatshirt. Also, the shirt runs small but the holes around the wrists are HUGE. There is no elasticity at all, and the sleeves are super short. I would return the product, but stupidly cut off the tag before trying it on."
A total rip off.  Returned.  So cheaply made
i got a size medium. they were basically a size 0. i gave them to someone.
shoulder was busted first day. Sleeve had broken cheap stiches kinda hard to hide the white shirt I was wearing underneath. Poor stitching.
These are a tad bit small for wayfarer-knock offs.
"These shoes were too small and too tight, I ordered my regular size (8.5). I ended up sending them back for a refund"
I can wear them but it is tight on my feet.  the length is fine the problem is if my feet swell at all I will not be able to wear them.  That means when want to wear them most (during the summer) I may not be able to.
"I ordered these in a size 7. I usually wear a 7-7.5. I noticed that the band has stretched out tremendously in the 3 months that I have had them. I also think that I may have received the male size and not the female size. I just noticed that the Woman's shoe should have a W on the bottom-that means woman (and not wide width). My shoes do not and I ordered exactly as the advertisement is shown above. (Crocs Women's Capri IV Sandal,Mushroom/Espresso,7 M US)"
I really liked the dress. Sizing is not accurate. Too tight at shoulders and chest area. Had to give it to my daughter.
Got a 14 an 18 and a 20. The chains are fine but the length differences are huge. Very disappointing.  Will keep to avoid return mail charges.
"Worked good until dropped, one drop and it stopped working"
This Shirts that I order (both white and black) is nothing like the previous one I order; in fact I am in the process of returning those items and hopefully get a better fit one
"Beautiful and stunning but bad quality. Within 40 days, the rose color started tarnishing. Took back to Dillard's they exchanged. Second one started tarnishing on handle. Taking back that one too. They are totally not water resistant, I'm sure these problems are from minimum water touching it from washing my hands. I can't be taking it off everytime I need to wash my hands"
"I returned this skirt.  It was very nice, but way too short for me."
These run VERY small. Manufacturer and seller both admitted this after I returned this jacket. Fits more like an XL than a XXX-L.
"5'7"" 125lbs; ordered size small.  Pants fit but were too short and the cut was not flattering at all."
"Too large. Went by the size chart, oh well. Will not be reordered, cheap material."
These are more like footless stockings than leggings. I put them on and they immediately got a run in them. Disappointing.
"Really wanted these to work. All wrong for my feet. We're a bit binding then rolled up within 60 seconds.  Not for me, nor can I recommend.  I only wear a 7-71/2 so no big foot issue here."
"I really wanted to like this dress. I'm disappointed in how it turned out.

The biggest issue was how the fabric sat across the bust. Those pleats are not stitched into place uniformly and instead just has some anchoring stitches every few inches. If you're busty, that means the fabric will shift, the line from the pleats will look weird as it's peeled apart from where it was originally pressed, and the anchoring stitches will show.

The back of the collar also didn't lay flat across the back of my neck. There was a gap created by the fact that the fabric stood up. The dress fit well around the abdomen so I couldn't have purchased a size down to fix this issue."
buckle broke first week! cheaply made would not buy ever again!
Way too small but I wore it anyway. It was for a holloween costume as Jubilee & I didn't have time to re-order or find a replacement. It worked out. Super snug though.
I wished that the shaker held more liquid.  The pink hair dye came out purple.  The sneakers are very cheaply made.  Definently not worth $75.00  I can get the same thing at Walmart for $25.00
I returned these.  Too small.
Not real silver faded after 3months. Fake
"I was so excited to get these earrings!  No more.
They came in a HUGE envelope mailer, each earring wrapped in a little plastic pouch.  The envelope was pretty battered, like it had gotten stuck in a sort machine.
One earring looked like the picture.  The other - the silver was bent in HALF - as in, the back clasp was standing up straight, but the entire 'fishhook' part that should be hanging in your ear was bent over to touch the stone attachment.  Additionally....the stone wasn't even attached to the earring - the bailing ring was broken in two.  Mind you, they were both broken INSIDE of their little ""securely wrapped"" package.
I did attempt once to straighten the bent earring portion, and the ""silver"" snapped in my hands.  I took the earrings with me to my jeweler (I was already there to get my watch tuned up ), and after careful inspection, he stated that these are NOT ""sterling"" silver as advertised, but rather silver-plated over a base metal.
This is the first time I got a total dud from Amazon.  I'm so glad I had them shipped to me, rather than their intended recipient.  How embarrassed I would have been!"
"Cute but too sheer (all tags show through ) and pulls easily (more so than tights). My daughter wore this once and it has a pull in it. If I could return I would, but it's been used. Pictures didn't show how sheer this pull on skirt is."
Never again will I purchase something like this.  Horrible considering the price I paid!!!
They were too small and I had to return them
"this thing is purely cosmetic, it will not hold your pants up like any other belt would. it just stretches and they fall."
Received the dark version of this one.
"I got these for my wife and other Dri-Fit for myself, and I must say that they are way too tight on the calves for both of us. I don't even have the muscle that I did when I played basketball and did weight training in my 20s, and these left an abrasion around my legs. My wife gave hers to our 12 year old daughter. They did, however, keep my our dry. So if you have calves like a 12 year old girl, these are the socks for you."
Not only did the sizing on this shirt run way too small (my X-large was more like a medium) but the red in the front flag was orange and the bow in the back looked nothing like what was in the picture. I was really disappointed.
I thought this would be bigger and work better. T seems like it doesn't get any more tarnish off then my old other brand that I've had for years. I guess for the price it's ok.
I got this jacket for my husband in XL but it was way too big for him around the waist.  When we exchanged it for a Large the waist band still didn't hold tight to his waist (allowing cold wind to blow up his jacket) and the hood it pretty much stuck in the up position.  This jacket is very rigid which is good but they made the hood in such a way that it can not lay down flat and it can not be removed.  We returned the smaller jacket.  The jacket seems of really nice quality and very durable but it just wasn't right for my husband.
I ordered these in the same size that my other Toms are and they are way too small. Very narrow as well. Had to return..
"I bought these back in December. I have never worn them outside the house. I have only worn them inside. I didn't even wear them everyday. Last week, the back of the left slippers heel split in half. Now the foam has fallen out and it is too late to return.

We now have a new puppy and I have turned them into a puppy toy for him. I was not happy with the quality of the slippers. Very sad because I really liked them, they were very comfortable. Now they are a dog toy."
I bought L and it was small. I bounty a second one XL and it fit as the L. Overall the bra is good that's why I wanted to invest in one but if you are large busted this is not s good option
Was not right size
cheap and thin and does not fit well
"I ordered 'Jamie' several years ago and the fit was perfect from the moment I put them on.  I ordered the redesigned 'Jamie' from Amazon and found them unwearable (shorter and narrower through the toes).  I'm disappointed but it's not Amazon's fault.  Unfortunately, I had to return them."
I have this in 514 midnight rinse smae size but these do not give due to the double back. order a size up.
Six not accurate and nothing like in the picture.  Cheap
"If they had splurged a few extra pennies and put better elastic at the thighs, I'd be delighted with these.  There is minimal elastic and as such they do not stay on your thigh but slip down into more of a basic leg warmer. They're going back..."
"I love these earrings & will explain why I am giving 2 stars instead of 5. They're very simple but pretty & go with a variety of other types jewelry.
The reason I've reduced the rating despite wearing these all the time, including now, is because unlike other Amazon Collection earrings I have, the scale on the model in the image of this is distorted & I expected these earrings to be much larger than they are. Instead of"
These are terrible.  The waists are WAY TOO BIG! They cannot even be tightened... don't waste your money.
"Zipper separated from the boot in a short amount of time.  Considering the cost to repair, not a great deal"
Didnt fit me...:(
"We have had this bag for two weeks and used it 3 times carrying a change of clothes to soccer practice. While the size is perfect, the workmanship/material is not high quality. The seam near the zipper has started to fray and it now has a 3 inch hole. Granted, it's an inexpensive bag...but I expected it to last more than 3 uses."
Way too tight and small.
"Listen folks, I'm not a tiny guy by no means, I'm a big, husky guy not overly fat that has a hard time finding a cut of jeans that actually fit my thick frame. These jeans ordered are my size I usually order with Wrangler. Boy, the seat in these bad boys are huge and the legs are extremely large too. I don't think no amount of dryer shrinkage will change the cut...I probably could have stood a size or two smaller for the waist..but the legs are very large cut. The material they were made of seems of good quality as was the zipper. Sorry, but these over sized monsters had to be returned."
"Did not care for the material, it felt like plastic. I returned it."
"Whose head is this big? Even with padding at the top on the inside, the only person this mask will fit is Frankenstein himself. It's not what I expected. I guess I'll use it on a Halloween prop."
Too big. Larger than a standard wallet. Too big for my pockets.
No comfortable at all.
Fell apart and broke within a week. The zipper on the second pouch disconnected and the seams fell apart. :(
"Like many rolling models, the wheels started falling off after 2nd use."
"Guns are not a fashion accessory. They are dangerous weapons. That can go off if dropped (yes, this is a real thing that does happen). Carrying a gun like this is extreamly dangerous and could very well lead to an accidental discharge. If you want to carry a gun that is fine, but you need to do it safely in a real holster. If that leaves a bulge, oh, well. Ssfety comes before fashion."
Although the item was sewn well it was not long enough
It is not the hat pictured on the advertisement. It is not felt. It is imitation leather. A tacky looking cheap costume hat. I bought this one as a back up to the one I already own that is felt. Don't order this item from this company.
Completely sheer. I mean you can count freckles through this.
It doesn't push up and it's not red. It's fluorescent pink.
"These didn't make it halfway down my daughter's shoes, then became so stuck that when we couldn't get them out we had to cut them out with scissors. Complete waste of money, not like others we've used in the past"
"I bought these for my fianc and my father. One set looked great, while the other looks cheap because it was scratched. Very disappointed since these were supposed to be matching gifts for them to wear to the wedding."
No support.. Runs small.. Good for slippers..
"I need a new bag, the zippers on here have a defect!"
I loved the price but returned the item because it was not made very well.  There are items that I am willing to overlook the quality of because of the price but upon receiving them I knew they would not hold up well and instead invested in another pair of jammers for swimming.
"These are the most piece of s*** socks I've ever bought. Upon one or two wearings they get holes in the toes, regardless of how well trimmed your nails are. Don't buy these."
"Second time ware and found this.

The quality is......."
To small...Sleeves are very short
Really uncomfortable.  These are hard and cause blisters.
"These have a different fit than the classic style. These do run a size smaller, but are wide. I got a size 11 and now these are even wider. I noticed that the croc straps don't stay put, so I can't actually use it. They were returned for another style. If you don't mind using these to just have slip on's and have wide feet, these may work out ok."
Cute outfit but the material snagged on something in washer and shredded
love color fits way to small
For an extra large it was very small.  Not the PINK color I was expecting--more of a coral.  Very disappointed.  Won't purchase again.
The front side legs were cut way to high.
I didn't like the sticky rubber feel to the fabric.
"Great length (thanks for making tall lengths!!), but too tight in the hips and upper thighs. I disagree with the ""relaxed fit"" designation. (I returned these.)"
"sleeves are too short on me and im only 5'4"""
"These shoes were heavier than i expected, but the biggest issue is the squeaking. I wore them for a day and people kept laughing at how loud they squeaked! They were not as comfortable as I had hoped either."
Runs about 4 sizes too small
These would be great if the print weren't upside down.
"Cool looking but with a VERY stiff sole that has no cushioning for the bottom of your foot. Avoid if you have high arches. These shoes didn't work for me. Sadly, I had to return."
Fits nice around the band and comfy fabric but my boobs keep falling out whenever I bend over and it doesn't hold a nursing pad well.
"First, I don't think this is cotton...I think it is polyester or maybe a polyester blend.  There is no tag in the clothing to tell what it's actually made of or washing instructions.  There was a tag in the bag with washing instructions.  Mostly it just doesn't look good on me.  I was worried about the one size fits all sizing, and I was right.  I could deal with the body being loose and flowy, but the sleeves are just way too big and make the whole thing look sloppy.  I really wanted to like this, but I don't."
"As light as packing peanuts and just as cheaply made. Ordered a medium, my heels hang off back and straps too snug on top of feet"
Very poor quality materials was disappointed
"I gave these to my mom as a gift for rainy days and she hates them. They're too big, heavy, and hard to walk on."
"Very poort quality, cheap."
Junk...broke after first use as a carry-on
"it is really different from the picture, this is really big, I thought that was short, but is really large, they reply it because of some trouble."
Don't buy. Horrible
"Cheap looking beach dress.  I didn't like this peach one in particular, so I returned it.  Some of the beach dresses look so nice that you can wear them out and about.  Not this one."
"Plus size? I don't think so, These were way too small around the legs. They are a very soft material , but doesn't give much."
Zipper broke within 5 days
Cheaply made.  Terrible fit.
"I tried this on my own skin first.  Yes, its gentle & left my skin feeling soft.  But I hated the scent.  It has a white musk scent that actually makes me nauseous.  I cant stand musk scents.  And it lingers.  I had to scrub with another soap to get rid of the scent on my skin.  If you like the scent, this is a really good cleansing gel.
Why put fragrance in a baby/sensitive skin product?!"
Looks a bit cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.
"This mannequin's head is only half way, not round! I am using for hats display so this doesn't work for me. The plastic is very cheap made and some of parts are very difficult to put them all in together. On the top of head has a hole which looks very bad on the head, although it is cheap, I think it is still waste the money."
"cheap material, no cotton feel at all."
"Sizing is weird. I ordered an 8. [I normally wear an 8 or an 8 1/2 - {depends ya know}...] But, they were about 1/2"" shorter than an 8. More like a 7- 1/2... AND the sides of your feet are on the ground. Literally in the ground! I don't have wide feet either... Or narrow feet for that matter... Just normal! So, I returned them. Even though they are very cute!
The seller was cool with it and all... No problem there. Just that you have to PAY to send them back! Kinda B.S. -- Just saying... They act like they're sending you a label to print - But it's just an address label and paper to place inside with your package... They refunded me the money... Cool! BUT--- I don't think you should have to pay to send them back is all. I mean - what is PRIME for? RIGHT!?!
I unknowingly bought my husband shoes from the same dealer - Which he didn't care for and had to PAY to send those back too... So, not just a fluke."
This was way too large and baggy!
"Feels much rougher than my tommy bahama shirts, almost like wool. Can't recommend this to anyone."
It fit perfectly the problem I have with it is I found a higher quality one at Walmart for cheaper.
Really cheap construction.  Very bad arch support.  The laces are something you might find on a cheap child's shoe.  Heidi Klum should be embarrassed.
very thin & short in length
"I normally wear a medium, but wanted this type of pant to be loose so I ordered a large.  It was too small and I returned them. I was very disappointed."
To small for me even though its a size up from what i amits very uncomfortable i really do not like this purchase...
I would not recomend this to anyone.
The 11was too small but the back area of shoe was way wide & my foot would come up out of the shoe if my toes didn't hit the front of the shoe. Odd design
"I am 6ft 2in and weigh around 220lbs. I have a 45in chest. The XL sweater was very snug on me. I returned it because I could layer it with a Button Down. Hopefully, they can make bigger sizes."
"these fit me very small.  I ordered a large and they should have fit according to the size chart and my waist, but the pouch is very uncomfortable."
"I hated the dress, is really not like the one in the picture"
"My son is a toddler size 8, this toddler size 8 barely fit him. Worked for our river trip which is why we bought them, but definitely won't fit him long. I would order a bigger size than what you need."
"This costume is not like the photo.  The material is thinner.  It fits tiny and the length is more like a shirt vs. a dress.  The hoop wiring came apart and is so bent that it won't correctly shape.  Not worth the money AT ALL.  I was in a pinch and was forced to keep this item, which made me cringe.  I had to replace the hoop wiring with better materials, thus spending even more money."
It was a super cute outfit and I loved that it snapped the whole way down and in the legs. It had one major flaw... plastic snaps. They don't snap well and unsnapped often if you could get them to snap at all (especially with movement .) I'm sad that this purchase didn't turn out better.
Where were these made ! The pants could not have fit worse...I have purchased Lee products for years...always fit perfectly...Who knows who made these pants....
Xl is to small
"Big for a size small. Fits like a medium.
The color for aqua, is NOT indeed Aqua. It's Sea Green. Not even close to a light Misty sky blue.

Very unhappy for showing incorrect colors online. Extremely deceiving!"
"Bought 2 pair. After one trip through the washing machine one pair pretty much fell apart, holes, tears etc. The other pair is still together but I guess time will tell. From now on only dealing with the Levis website, hopefully it is better"
"I bought the Large-1.5 size and they feel like a Junior's size small.  I'll give them to my adult daughter, she can wear them to the gym."
too small and pretty weird looking in person and on the foot. i returned them.
These did not work for me.
"returning. Never wore them.  Hard to tell, but over the color on the main strap - there are tiny little glitter things. tacky. Also, the ankle straps, won't go all the way around my ankle. And I don't have massive ankles.  The foot part fits my foot, but ankle straps - waaaay too short"
It is a nice shirt. Don't get me wrong it is a very nice shirt. It was just a little to big. The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the return was a little tricky when I had to send it back because it was to big.
Handle broken and completely fell apart after two months of use. The company is nonresponsive. Not worth your time or money. I'd give a zero star rating if it was an option.
"I was super excited about this dress, buy unfortunately it is not designed got tall people. I'm 5'10"" 145. The medium was a little too big around but the waist was way too high and the striped portion was just too ""short"" for my torso. I love the design, though, so if you're shorter, buy away and enjoy for me :)"
Fit OK but the toe cap cut into the outside of my left foot.  I am opting for the no-charge return ... Thanks Amazon.
"I have another pair this same brand and size from Macy's that slide right on, these didn't even fit it's like they were 2 sizes smaller, I even compared labels....Guess that's why they were $49 on Amazon and $99 at Macy's."
"Cute, but poor quality.  The soles began coming apart from the shoe within a week (with light use, no rain/puddles/etc). The surface around the ankle started scratching off after about 2 weeks (again, not even with hard use, and with pants covering that part of the shoe).  The shape fits baby feet well, however the quality if super cheap."
"Didn't stick to teeth, even after holding in place for over 5 minutes"
"Great fit but the ""Green"" was actually turquoise/teal color."
"No fly, couldn't you tell us that, they are advertised as underwear..."
I DIDN'T NEED THE ARMS AND IT WAS TOO LONG IN LEGS I EXCHANGED AND GOT THE ONE WITH MID LEG & I LOVE IT THIS SELLER ITEMS ARE GREAT FOR POST LIPO
This was not what I thought it would be like. There are pieces of fabric that rub and poke me and its kind of uncomfortable. I wouldnt recommend this bra personally.
"I love Sam Edelman flats, but these boots just didn't feel great. They fit on the small side, so round up or size up. I'm 8 to 8.5, and the 8 was definitely too small--ouch. The 8.5 was a better fit, but it's not a boot you want to put on for comfort, and it doesn't feel very solid. They look pretty cute, though somewhat generic, but ultimately I felt they wouldn't hold up to the walking I put my boots through."
"Sizing was off. Too small. I would say when ordering you would need to order one size up from what you normally wear. Yoga mat bottom was a bit plastic feeling as oppose to mat like. The straps that hold your foot in where not very soft. Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

"I bought this in beige and what I received looks more like a peach color. It's very thin, which makes it look cheap and more see-thru than actually shown in the pic. My mistake was that I did not go for a darker color as it wouldn't look so bad. You can't go wrong with a black cardigan.
I wouldn't recommend this item since you would purchase better quality for less somewhere else."
Huge waste of money - the hat is see through & hideous.
It wasn't what I expected.  I wouldn't get this a gain.  it was too big.  Not the sellers fault. k
This shirt is just a regular length. It is not long at all and runs two sizes too small. Good price. Bad deal. It must have been made for very small people and to think I ordered a size larger than what I usually ordered!
"I literally could not get these on my daughter's feet. I loosened the tie in front as much as possibly (which is not much) and it was absolutely impossible! Incredibly frustrating and my daughter cried because she liked them so much. It is a shame, because the boots are super cute. My daughter is tiny and does not have wide feet. I cannot imagine how anyone has actually been able to get a foot in these! Definitely pass on these!!!"
"this BRA is too stretchy... band on bottom, not supportive.. do not like falling out look,,, but liked adjustable straps... that is all I can say...  pattie"
"I've purchased other rings from this Amazon retailer and they've been beautiful. This one, however, has almost no sparkle. I'm not sure if it's a dud, as I see the other reviewers give it 5 stars, but even in jewelry showroom lighting it's still dull. The ring itself seems to be of nice quality and sturdy. Just no sparkle, unfortunately.

Metal Factory, if I did just get a dud, I'll happily ship it back for a replacement."
I ordered a large and it went around me but not by very much.  The material was very thin.  Just did not like the quality of the fabric.
Not water proof.  Just a mere decoration. Very disappointed.
"I was SO excited to begin to wear this gorgeous piece by Honeycat. The package came, and the necklace was displayed beautifully in simple and elegant packaging.
  However, after 3 days of wear (taken off in showers) it made a ring of green around my neck. The shine on the necklace wore off by day 5. It's definitely a fantastic looking piece and exactly what I was looking for, but please do not wear this over a few hours for special occasions.
 Its now been almost 3 weeks since I purchased this, and I wear it occasionally despite everything because it is adorable."
"Returning these. The fit is very wide at the top and the strap doesn't adjust much.  The spikes on the bottom aren't spaced properly, so you can feel them through the shoes when walking.  Need another spike at the top by the toes to make it even. Otherwise, they would be comfortable and lightweight and the price is great."
"I've been looking for socks that don't cut off the circulation in my calves from being too tight in the upper part of the sock.  I ordered these in extra large hoping that they would suffice.  Unfortunately, while the lower part of the sock is extra large the upper part is the same size as all other sizes no matter whether they're medium, large or extra large.  So I can't wear these because like all other socks they're too tight around the calf.

Does anyone know of a sock that doesn't squeeze one's calf until it leaves an impression in the skin for hours?"
"Awful product. After less than two months of wear, the sole has already split apart from the upper. Will never buy another pair of shoes from Nunn Bush again."
"I couldn't even put it over my head. It was way to small too even be considered a large. Does not stretch at all as well as I thought it would. Thank goodness for the free return deal it came with or I would have been very displeased if I had to actually pay to send it back.
Buyer beware."
It's like it was made for a toddler! Way too small for a normal adult head! And not as soft as you would think!
This chain is just OK. Its cute but it is really cheap. You may only get a few wears out of it before the color turns. Looks good against black material. I wore mine with a sexy black over the knee dress. Very classy.
Very flimsy no support.
"Not very good product, somewhat disappointed"
"Based on reviews, I sized up 2 sizes, and it still fit too snug.  The sleeves fit like sausage casings, and the front panels didn't even cover the sides of my chest.  Cheap flimsy fabric, too.  Returned."
"- Earring (ONLY ONE) is very cheap quality and much smaller than it appears in the photos.
- Earring is three pieces: The stud, the backing, and the part with several smaller stars.

Overall, I'd definitely not buy it again or recommend it to anyone. It looks like it could fall apart at any moment. It's somewhat cute, but you'd be way more satisfied spending your money elsewhere!"
Bought this for my 6 year old and she won't even wear it. It's cheaply made. The material is itchy. Waste of money.
"SHOE WERE NOT TRUE TO SIZE, WAY TOO SMALL."
Cute but my 6 year old is not always able to open and close independently.
"My son has only ever worn Asics. He wore these for 2 weeks every day and the left sole completely fell apart.  Other than that the fit was good and shoe was comfortable.  Unfortunately I can't sent them back as he needs them for maritime academy.  I have taken a picture to try to get money back....they are not inexpensive.  And to make matters worse, I had to order another pair as he's required to wear an all white athletic shoe and at size 14, there is very little choice."
Uncomfortable.
I am a bigger guy and tall as well.  I ordered a 36/37 sleeve and they fit closer to 34/35 lenght.  Neck maybe about a half inch smaller than what it is labeled as well.  Chest fit and length otherwise good.  My real problem is some very poor stitching across the back as you can see in the picture below.  The shirt is literally falling apart straight out of the package and will be going back.
Truly disappointed. Very cheap looking and you can tell they spray painted the chain part with gold. Do not buy.
"I fell in love with these tops as soon as I opened the package but that soon turned to disappointment. I ordered 4 of this style in turquoise, black, white, and what looks like wine red. The necklaces are plastic, which in itself isn't a problem, but were all scratched up. Every single top has noticeable defects. Seams weren't even, sections weren't gathered,sleeves and yoke are crooked. I'm disappointed because of these being made so shoddy. The seller was quick to resolve this and is sending out replacements. I had also ordered three of the sleeveless tops along with these, and all of three had the same defects. That's 7 defective items out of 7ordered. I will not order anything from this seller again."
not as expected. had to return it.
"My chiropractor has been on me for awhile now to wear Dansko's, and do wear some of the sandals, but I needed more of a sneaker style for traveling and doing a lot of walking on our Alaska vacation. I always wear a size 40 in the Dansko sandals, but being that this is an enclosed shoe, I should've went up to at least a 41. I do have a wide foot, and these wear squeezing my foot a little too much. The heel was wide though and my foot was slipping and gaping around the ankle. Most sneakers have the extra hole up at the top to help prevent this, but these don't have it. The fit just isn't for me, so unfortunately I'll be sending them back and trying something different."
Very disappointed. Very thin corse weave.  I returned it
most uncomfortable shoe I have every put on
"no structure, no support, paper thin sole. I have better flip flops"
Very thin material.  Like the style.  Should have sent back but will wear with something over it.  Too thin to wear alone.
"OK - these are nice socks - after all, they're ""Gold Toe!""  However, I was looking for cotton socks to wear with my blue jeans.  These are definately trouser socks - to be worn with slacks.  Very thin.  Not warm at all - in fact, pretty worthless in Minnesota!  They said they were cotton socks, so I was very disappointed with these.  If I had been looking for trouser socks, I would have been delighted!  Some things should not be bought over the internet, I suppose.  If I'd seen these in a store, I would have passed them over."
"I purchased this as I travel a lot overseas and wanted it for the security reasons (passport, credit cards etc).  The lining seems too loose and makes it hard to search for stuff.  However, worse to come.  The zipper on the back top compartment broke after the first week of use.  Not a very strong zip."
too much work and too confusing to put on.  waste of money.  i onl;y said fit as expected because I didn't actually get it on.
"Very unsatisfied with this product. My husband and I are expecting our first child, late Nov of this year. I purchased this outfit for our baby with great excitement that we will have him in a cute Christmas outfit for family pictures. The product did arrive on time, however, when I opened the package, I was most discouraged to see the plastic bag that the outfit was in was ripped, torn, and even opened! It was as if someone shoved the outfit in the bag and stuffed it in the plastic wrap. Words that would describe this outfit are ""a cheap Halloween costume"". I ordered a newborn size, and the outfit I received is way too big. I could put a full grown baby in this costume with room to spare. The material is very cheap, scratchy, and had white fuzz all over it. As a new mother, I would never put my newborn in this outfit, and I do not recommend it to anyone. Amazon has been very prompt about my refund, and I will be sending this back and replacing it with something of better quality and size."
"I bought them because they were skechers, had memory foam insoles which my son loves, and were a great price. My son did not like these shoes. Even in extra wide he said one of the shoes pushed on his little toe too tight. He also said they were stiff and uncomfortable. It took too much energy to walk in them unlike his last pair of Skechers that he loved, but Amazon doesn't carry in his new size."
"They look like giant whitey tighties. the front is faux leather and the back is like meshy fabric. I don't know what to think, all I know is they're ugly."
"Huuuuuge! I've never ordered Kanu shorts before, but I have several pairs of board shorts from various brands. They're all in the size 5-7 range. I ordered these shorts in a size 4 and hoped they wouldn't be too snug. These either run really, really big or they were mis-sized at the factory. They looked more like a size 10. The waistband was at least 4 inches too big and even cinched as tight as it would go, they fell right down around my ankles. Fabric is good quality and style is cute, but unfortunately sizing is way off. By reading the very mixed reviews about sizing, I'd guess it isn't very accurate. Returned these."
smaller than u.s. guidelines
"These boots look and fit great but they are so stiff, I mean seriously stiff, especially in the ankle area. I really just don't think I will be able to wear these. I am so sad because they are so freakin' cute..sigh."
"Tank top is listed at a ""large"" on the tag but is more akin to a small or extra small by U.S. standards. The quality seemed fine for the price but the sizing is way off. If it sounds to good to be true it probably is!"
"If you want cone boobs, order up. Horrible fit!"
The large elastic hit me just at my ankle and since I have sprained my ankle many times it is always a bit swollen. It made the swelling look worse than it actually is.  Wish I could keep them because they were very comfortable but they just did not look right.
"The Quality of this item is very poor it came apart only about 3 uses. The part around the
Cup came undone"
"I like the look and style.  The shoe is overpriced for the quality of what I got - Very thin and flimsy sole. Zero foot support. The big label on the heel is quite large and bright white and blue and cheap looking. If you are into labels and don't care about foot support, go for it."
There is nothing much more to add except it is too big and I cannot wear it.
"Really! They sent me worn booties! Based on the photos would be happy? I love these Booties but I absolutly hate that they sent me used shoes. Ridiculous!

I usually wear a size 9 but purchased at 9.5 because I don't have narrow feet."
"Horrible quality;
fit
cotton
weave
toe/heel fit
price
What happened?"
These campus get annoying quickly. They like to ride up all the time. So I have to keep pulling them back down.
"Sizing is very imprecise. I had the right size but one heal very sloppy, the other just right. Second pair the same. Cute shoe but seem to have quality assurance problems"
Had to send these back as they were too small.
"I ordered 3 boleros of different colors of the same size from the vendor, ChocolatePickle. The two (tagged Bina) were ok, but the 3rd (red, tagged Sui) was big in the armhole. Apparently, it is from a different lot. No quality control. I decided I will return it for refund. When I found out it was from the UK, I had second thoughts as I knew I will get very little refund from what I paid for. So I will have to make do with what I got. It is too bad that it is hit and miss when you buy from this vendor. Better not to take risk and avoid altogether."
"Well, this is a little disappointing.  I ordered the red hat and it looked really cute in the pic...and in fairness it kinda looks like that in person, but the hat itself is like felt covered plastic. Kind of like a cheap dress up hat for a little kid, or maybe for a costume. It shipped fast, but I guess you get what you pay for."
"First, it's not a pale purple like in the picture, but a more saturated or 'true' purple. But honestly, I'm a size 8, the thong fits fine and it's ok. Whatever. But this is a tank top. Not a dress!! Not NEARLY long enough to be anything near a dress. It goes a couple inches past my navel and that's it. As a purple fishnet tank top, it's actually pretty good. But this is not a ""mesh mini dress"". AT ALL."
This was too big and honestly just made very poorly I ended up donating it and getting my money back I'm not pleased with this at all
Shrinks something terrible.
"Hurt the inner part of my toes, where the strap goes."
"Fell apart 7 months after I received it.  The clear plastic cover where your ID goes ripped off one three sides.  Don't waste your money!  I thought that this being a mywalit, it would be high quality, but it isn't."
RETURNED SORELS BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE IN CHINA AND SEEM TO HAVE HALF THE MATERIALS THAT I HAD ON MY 1985 PAIR THAT JUST WORE OUT.
I am a fan of Quiksilver and should know better when it comes to ordering the appropriate size. I've worn Quiksilver since my teen years and somehow still manage to occasionally convince myself that I can wear the same sizes now as a 30-something adult. Quiksilver is not kind to beer guts so make sure you go a size higher than what you might get away with in other brands.
I DONT LIKE
Not at all like exact style number from Kohls.
"Perfect fit.....  If I was still in the fifth grade.  I stand 5'10"" tall and weigh around 200 lbs.  Too small,  too tight."
cheap the bend if you sit on them
This is cute locket but Huge in size. It is the size of a gold dollar coin. In my opinion to big for as locket.
"Fits weird, really loose in waist ,and tight through butt"
"The quality of materials in this boot does not match the price.  The leather is thin and overly soft, so the boot does not hold shape from the moment you take them out of the box.  The stacked heel is made of plastic or some other synthetic and not made of leather.  To be fair the overall construction seemed well done, but otherwise this should be a $75 boot.

My advice would be to spend the same money on Hathorn boots or something similar and call it a day.  As someone who once swore by Chippewa, I was very disappointed."
Pretty terrible quality and they start hurt your feet after wearing them for a while...
I did not get that ring. I sent it back
"I don't like it. The material is so cheap. Looks like somebody used it before they ship it to me. And there is a hole on the side 

I got the small though, stretchy except the arm side."
"And I have tried to return, but to no avail. Seems I cannot get past the last ""Continue"" button in the process of returning. It's hard to buy jeans so I bought three kinds. I guessed wrong with the Levi's, so please advise to the refund action that does not work. Thank you. Mr. Kerry Koper (cyberghostx13@yahoo.com)"
"Came apart,no good"
"It is not what I expected, too small, cannot fit 4 cards in it.
Also it came already damaged.
If you return it they expect you to pay for the shipping.
Don't but this."
poor structure
"This is a very thick t-shirt-like material. It's not the nylon/spandex smooth underwear that let's your clothes just slide on. Just looking at it and touching it, you KNOW it's going to make you sweat if you wear it. No point in even trying it on. Back it goes."
Too thin. Not very comfortable
"Although the size was prefect, I wore them a few times and they ripped. The quality of the fabric is very cheap and I wouldn't buy again."
"I wear 32"" and ordered M, and it is unwearably small - pants' waist is 29"" and stretches hardly."
AS SHOWN ON THE SITE HERE THE OPAL LOOKS SMOOTH..DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IT HAD A FACETED FACE AND WAS NOT FLAT...THE FACETS TOOK AWAY FROM THE COLOR OF THE STONE....IF STONE HAD BEEN SMOOTH I'M SURE THE PERSON I GAVE IT TO WOULD HAVE LOVED IT..AS OPAL IS HER FAVORITE ...I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I STILL SEE A SMOOTH STONE IN THIS PICTURE..
"Wanted to love this, but found it awkwardly cut, with a strangle little flare at hips that doesn't show in picture. Refer to other 2-star reviews, which also explain this. The material is very thick and stiff, and if you're familiar with carhartt jeans, you probably know to expect this. I've had carhartt jeans of the same fabric and construction, and they do not soften or unstiffen over time, no matter how many washings. This would be an advantage if you're planning to use these clothes as tough work-clothes, but for regular wear, they are much too stiff. The vest's collar is especially unfortunate: it hits you in the neck or jawline. The assembly and features are very good, though: good, tough interior pockets and a nice panel behind the zipper that keeps the wind out. If you want something brawny, this might be for you. I'm sending mine back."
Owned and worn less than a month and falling apart.  Dreadful odor throughout. complete waste of money!
"I loved the style, but after one wash it was a mess of balls. Can't wear. Looks terrible."
"This was my first Clarks shoe purchase and having heard so much about the quality and fit I was anxious to receive this pair of shoes. Unfortunately, they didn't meet my expectations as to fit.  I have a narrow foot and even though I bought 7N, the shoe was quite wide. What was really unusual is that my foot didn't sit in the shoe correctly and it felt lopsided.  I don't know if it was the way the shoes are made or my feet, but this is the only pair of shoes I have ever bought that felt so odd.  I had to return them."
"These seem lovely, except they are too tight, and I will either have to pay 50% of the cost of purchase simply to ship them back, or travel inconveniently out of my way to return them :(  So I will simply have to donate them, which is frustrating.

I followed the advice and a number of reviewers, and ordered 2 sizes below my regular shoe size; I discovered I should have only gone down 1 1/2 sizes - so be forewarned, you may need to go down 1 1/5-2 sizes down, and the cost to return them may almost be as much as the price of the shoes themselves.

The 2 stars are not for the quality of the shoe - they seem fine enough, but rather for the confusing measurements and inability to return in a reasonable manner.  Amazon will only take a return via UPS, and I could drop these in first class mail for next to nothing, so it just adds to the frustration.  Until now I'd been a big fan of Amazon.  Today, I'm not so sure - I learned that shoes may not be something to purchase through a service such as amazon.  I encourage you to consider outside retailers, perhaps those specializing in dance-wear, who can perhaps better direct you in terms of size.  Better yet, go to the store and try them on."
"Looked nice, seemed to work fine except that it broke the first time we used it.  The plastic arm from which you hang your clothes broke and came apart on the first leg of our trip.  Returned to the seller, no problem."
Wasn't what expected. Item was returned on December 30th
I've had other Kipling bags and had no problems but the strap on this one broke within days. Maybe I just got a defected one?  It was sadly returned. Very cute though.
The belt doesnt since the waist line and hide the scrunch marks in the shirt well.
Runs small and left blisters on my toddler's foot :(
Looks as expected. I wear a 12 in shoes typically and these are massively too big.
"I wish the whole thing had a zipper but instead it just velcros which doesn't make me feel like my stuff is safe. It would be good to keep inside another bag/purse but I do not think i would use is around my neck as I would be so worried about anything falling out. I have seen other ""wallets"" that have the same purpose but zips all the way around. I would suggest that instead."
Been wearing Adidas for ever...disappointed that the US10 would not fit me when all other Adidas shoes of the same size do...
Fit was not right
"These are NARROW!!!!! I couldn't even get my foot into them, and I ordered a half size bigger than usual, thinking I would wear thicker socks with them... Disappointing!!!"
These shoes are awful. Plus they're really ugly when you see them. They are huge and very cheep. surprising coming from jambu
"I ordered this for engagement pictures, arrived quickly but not that nice. I don't know why I was expecting more, I should know better. The material was a cheaper polyester not the nice flowy chiffon that I imagined. Overall it fit ok, a little bigger, but you could easily tell the difference between this quality and something you would find at department store. Ended up returning it and just spending more for something else."
Fabric print and design is great.  On the other hand I ordered Medium size but it fits like a small. Moreover it shrunk even further after 1st wash. When I emailed them about the issue they asked me to send it back at my expense.  How is it my fault that their sizing is off!!!
Horrible! Very cheap low quality fabric... it doesnt even deserve a star!
"Update: after a couple washes and dries, this shrunk quite a bit (and I ordered up a size for my husband). Shrunk in the way it sits too high on his waist now.  What a disappointment. Hoping for better quality.

Comfortable. The material is a little thin but seems like it is made fairly well made.  Color was as expected.  Purchased a size XL and I usually wear a L.  It fit a little big but not bad and it may shrink a bit in the dryer.  Received this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review."
Did not look good on me .its not even worth the money.made very cheap
It's a really nice jacket but very short - even the XXL. So be warned if you are tall - it only fits to the waist.
"Had a weird fit, the back look good but the front just laid funny.  Ran a bit small too, sent them back"
"Nice for price....,,,,,but not as silky soft feeling as I expected"
"Didn't lay flat, waste of money. Donated to charity thrift store instead of hassle of returning."
I've not even had them a month and the bottom is coming off. I'm not happy!
Too small in waist and elastic in the waist didn't give enough. I think they could have given more give in the waist line.
Bought this 3 sizes bigger thinking it fit like the picture but is super tight.
Inadequate ankle support. Get Danner or Teva
Uncomfortable. Disappointing quality. They look cheap and feel worse. They also are wide looking and bulkier than pix show.
"While the color was nice, the item was not. The wig itself does not look like the image, and there is not really a true sort of widows peek in the wig. The hair on the wig felt too much like plastic and wasn't soft at all. Just don't buy this wig."
Too narrow nor correct sizing.
Looks really nice and cool but it's really tight on your finger and the face cracked second time I wore it.
this had mostly tan and neutral colors. the  pic is deceiving .will not buy from this seller again
"I ordered a big boys size 14 black shirt with a black, gray, and white tie to match for my son.  When the sort arrived it had a red tie with it and the tie was the length for a toddler to wear it!  The tie comes down to the third button on the shirt!  Not only the wrong color, but also way to short for the shirt!  Very disappointing!"
"Love this ring, received it as a birthday gift (Christmas 2014). I just looked at it and the silver has rubbed off and it is yellow. I do not like gold colored jewelry.  :-( very sad. And I just missed the return/replacement date so now I'm stuck with this yellow ring when it is supposed to be silver."
"Not quality product. Two days after my boy started to play with it, started to scratch and crack. The material is not good. Buy Hasbro, is more expensive but totally worthy"
"I have wide feet and I thought W would be wide enough, but not in this style, unfortunately -- I like the look and need red shoes... but I've returned them"
The fit is way off and the bra is terribly uncomfortable.
didn't like them.
Too small for belly piercing
It's broken!!!! I never got a chance to wear it!!! I went to set the correct time and the whole stem came out! Wanted it for breast cancer awareness. The only thing I'm aware of is you get what you pay for!!! Didn't deserve 1 star.
"They fit weird. The cut is just not right. I am not sure what is wrong exactly, but they are not comfortable to sit down in."
I would have put no stars is it would let me.  Purchased to use on our Disney vacation.  Didn't make it thought the first day before coming apart at the seams.  Terrible bag!!!
"same size as another pair I have same brand, similar style those fit great, but these were way too small, had to go back"
too cheap take a piece of paper and sew it together?
"The color isn't a pretty beige or taupe.  It's more this yellow ivory, definitely not flattering for me.  It also hangs poorly on my body.  I love a sweeping long sweater. But this isn't it"
"I did not like , the material it's poor, and expensive for the quality. Honestly I don't recommend."
"this is NOT an extra large - at least not by our American sizes. The fabric looks like it'd be cool enough and I suppose I could wear it on my arm and test it but it sort of defeats the purpose of it being you know, a shirt. To the costume chest it goes!"
"These aren't great. The fabric doesn't have much stretch so while they seem to fit large, they don't retain their shape well. Good enough for workout. Don't roll down which is a plus."
Came in the mail broken with middle stone piece unattached. Very disappointed!
I love Oakley but this style puts a mark on my nose and in my cheeks. I have a small frame of face but this one maybe too small.
Didn't like it at all. It hurt my feet.
Very flimsy and cheaply made. Size was too small for g string...didn't even try it.
runs far to small - easily 2 - 3 sizes. I'm sure it would look great if i could wear it!
the photo is one thing and reality is another
Breaks easily...but I guess you get what you pay for.
"I am 5'2"" and I weigh 113 lbs. I wear a size 3 jeans. The first size I ordered was the small. The top fit ok (34B bra size) but the bottoms were way too small. I had to order the bottoms in a large. They ended up a little tight from the booty still but not too bad that I can't deal. It was the front part of the bottoms that were too big because it was a large. Basically, if you have any booty, this suit is not for you. It's just not going to fit well. Sucks!"
On the small size for men's scrubs. More like unisex sizing.
the item not as the picture
POOR QUALITY CONTROL ON sizing .NOT HAPPY AT ALL.KWB
"This backpack was so cute and my daughter loved it until it started falling apart everywhere. The Peppa face started peeling away, and the foam inside ripped and it just looked awful after a few months of normal use at preschool. The zipper was the last thing that went and then we had to toss it. Such a shame as it was cute..."
Old lady pants for sure. Not at all the low rise relaxed fit as appears in picture.
It is like a tube sock
"I'm so disappointed!!! The top looks nothing like the picture. It has a thick black strap across the chest with stitching, very cheap material not swim suit material at all. The shoulder strap is not as thin as the picture the picture shows its maybe half an inch or less, it's really like an inch and a half maybe two. I can't stress how much the top looks nothing like the picture. Seeing this swim suit in person I would not buy it. I guess I could snip it hear and there and add it to my  lingerie collection. I normally wear a small but because of other reviews I ordered a M the bottom fit ok still nothing like the picture. I'm 5'6 120lbs 32DDD
Hope that helps at all. I give it one star because giving a star is required if not I wouldn't even give it one."
wore this one time and a hole is forming under the armpit and haven't even washed it. This is so cheaply made.
It looks metal but it's not
"Crappy dress: completely see-thru in white, halter top is barely 2"" so wouldn't cover anything at any size, just a poorly made product.  AND, Seller will not respond to request for return and refund...  thanks for nothing."
"Fits very strangly around the ankles, like it's loose and doesn't have a slim fitting to it. The material is not like regular cotton. I would not purchase these again."
These socks fit as expected but did wear out quickly. The holes that developed in the socks were all in the same place near the Hanes text so it seems to me it was an issue with the product quality.
"I love the look on these boots, however they are not good for walking or standing (and I am used to using heels). These boots don't provide good support and the sole is way too hard."
"Not what I expected for the money even if it were a quarter of the price. I decided to buy this because of the high ratings, I wish I had thken a closer look because most were given as a gift for the review or the price was greatly reduced for the review Take a close look at the picture of the back of it before you buy, The stone looks like a rhinestone in my daughters costume jewelry and gets its sparkle because it is lined with what looks like the coating on the back of a mirror. I am usually generous in my reviews but I can not in good conscience recommend this, at this price, to any one. I bought this for a gift but I will not be giving it. Hope I can get my money back. The only bright side of this is that it arrived quickly."
"I am 5'6-5'7, and these are a little short. If that were the only issue, I could look past it, but the legs...oh, the legs. They are painfully wide. They look ridiculous and cover my entire size 8.5 shoes. Short and wide ain't a good look for anyway, let alone a pregnant lady; I feel like an Oompa Loompa when I wear these."
Kinda tight and it's too poofy but I like the skirt Cus of the pocket . If it wasn't too poofy I would give it more stars
The outfit was very cute and the material was fine. This romper just runs extremely small. Order 2-3 sizes up.
I returned these.  Just not as cute in person.
"Terrible fabric quality, definitely a waste of money.  It went in the dog bed in place of stuffing almost immediately after opening."
This case was scratched in the back seemed like it was used. Didn't return because wasn't worth the trouble.
"Review as of 24 June 2015;
My Son spent his hard earned money on this necklace as my Mother's day gift because we THOUGHT it was sterling silver, like they claim it to be. Beware that this is, in fact, NOT STERLING SILVER! The photo shows the proof of that. Stealing silver does NOT wear off exposing copper metal beneath!
And never mind that the chain broke, which is what brought to my attention to the fact that he had, or rather WE have, been duped and ripped off!
This is just completely wrong. People who sell things under false pretenses, who outright lie about the product they're selling and have the nerve to charge these kind of prices for carnival-junk jewelry should be ashamed of themselves! At the very least the purchase price should be returned or a replacement sent!!

UPDATE: 17 November 2016:
 I was never contacted by anyone concerned with the sale of this necklace concerning the problem; which means:  After 17 months, I'm left to believe that my Son wasted his time and money since there has never been any type of a resolution with the necklace, other than being ignored and hoping it would be forgotten about.
This is very sad indeed because in the Sellers photo it looked so very beautiful and represented something precious for me. I wore it exclusively until the chain broke and I found that the silver plating had worn off exposing the copper underneath. Now I have nothing but this review and a photo of something I'd hope to have and wear forever. Pathetic as that sounds, it's still the truth.
As you can tell; I won't be buying nor recommending this item or Seller to anyone ---not after this fiasco! Due to the lack of regard in this problem from all concerned with the sale of this necklace.......
I SUGGEST THAT YOU DO NOT BUY THIS NECKLACE!!!!"
The material is comfortable. Be aware that the more you wash the more they fray and split apart.
"I loved the idea of these pajamas--I had super hero pajamas as a kid and remember whooping it up in them. However, the design of these Komar pajama sets leaves a lot to be desired.

The biggest problem is that they are VERY tight. My little boy is a string-bean and not at all thick through his limbs but these fit almost as tight as, well, tights. They're hard to get over his hands, especially if he's a bit damp from a bath.

The second problem is that though they're listed as ""100% cotton"" they don't feel like cotton. More like a cotton / polyester blend that's a bit scratchy. Not ideal for sleep wear.

That said, my son still loves them because they're Batman and Superman; he cares a lot less about fit and comfort than his Dad.

I'd not buy these again, mainly because they're so very tight fitting."
"This is an absolutely beautiful necklace with one major flaw: the lovely stone is weighted such that it flips over and shows the backside after about 30 seconds of wearing. I wore this for about four hours before finally giving up. Every time I checked, the stone had flipped to the back. They need to change the design so that the beautiful front shows. The materials are high-quality, this is just a design flaw.
I received a sample for review, the opinions are my own."
To small for what I was looking for gave it to my grandma.
"An entire size too small. Ridiculous. Had to return, and judging by the reviews, it looks as if everyone who bought these shoes experienced the same issue as me."
"I would not recommend this product unless you're willing to go up several sizes.  This item was way too small and tight.  I could barely breathe.  It dug into my underarms and caused bruising.

It was a cute style and would have been great if it actually fit."
Dress does not fit as described.  Dress was too small & the length was below my knees. Fit was uncomfortable & looked terrible on.
"Then it likely IS too good to be true.
I admit, when I saw the price more than $100 off list, I was eager to try this bag. It arrived with lightning speed, but the problems started the minute I opened the box. The purse had a bad, chemical odor to it. VERY unpleasant. Thinking perhaps it was because it was new, I tried it out. It's boxy (stiff), uncomfortable (the hand strap is too short, & the cross-body strap too thin for its length), and though the hardware photographs in silver, it is actually gold.
Completely disillusioned, I returned it for a refund."
"Ended up donating the shirt, because it wasn't worth sending back."
I wear a size 20/2x and the largest size was so small i had to return them. Very disappointed.
"Poor quality.  Not as bright in color as pictured,  Post on back of ear ring broke after several wearings.  Would not advise anyone to purchase these."
"had maybe 1 month, have not washed the and they're falling apart. comfy tho. we get what we pay for."
Again To small  I did not see the additional size chart until afrer item arrived
"Tiana B Women's High Low
I likr the material and the color but the size freaked me out size. 14 looks like 18 or 20. I was sorry about that because the model is very nice but they should work on size."
to small in the arms.  made a great present for someone else..
Not so comfortable.
"Not for me.  This was very thin and cheap fabric.  I put it on and it looked frumpy at best, no structure to it at all.  The front ""tails"" hung past my knee and I am 5'5"""".  It was larger than expected, and I took that into consideration.  Due to the multitude of wrinkles - as it came balled up in a plastic bag, the frumpyness, and my fear it wouldn't last a washing, I returned it.  I will say on some of the folks who took photos, it looks nice, but no not for me."
The bathing suit top is way smaller than the sizing suggests and it's not adjustable. I didn't even bother trying on the bottoms.  You have to pay the return shipping if you want to return it so probably going to give it to goodwill or throw it out. The customer service is hostile fyi.
"These shoes were no where near the appropriate size, ordered a 7.5, could not get my toes past the laces. I think they were mis sized, looked like a size 5."
can barely get over my knees. ran SO SUPER DUPER small.
"I don't notice any difference after using this product. When I applied it as necessary the blemishes remained. I didn't feel or look any different.

And, I have to agree with other reviewers complaining about the text on the bottle. It's tiny, black print, against a frosted, dark orange glass.

It just felt like I was applying this serum in vain, and I love Juice Beauty products, too."
"I really wanted to like Cinch jeans.  In a world of 'Skinny Jeans' it was refreshing to find a moderately slim cut jean with a boot cut.  However, these jeans are the least durable jeans I have ever owned.  They started developing holes where the fabric stretches.  I have worn this pair 8-10 times and there are already 2 holes and they are not the result of cutting, tearing, or abrasion.  The threads in the fabric just broke causing the surrounding threads to come unwoven.  Looking at the holes, the threads are extremely thin - almost like a t-shirt.  I suspect this is what gives the jeans a slight stretch.  However, it also appears to make them extremely fragile.  For $80, I expect wear the jeans a lot more than 8-10 time before they are worn out."
the feet are lined inside with cheap thin cardboard type material and is very uncomfortable. I can't wear them at all.
"lasted 3 weeks, hole on the sole"
Too snug and large is usually really lose on me.  So tight
This is a choker at best or big enough for a child. I did add some extensions to it and it worked well. Just be prepared for how short it is
I'm pretty sure I got a xl but it was way to small to pull over over shoulders saddly I had to give it to my mom
"This dress when I bought it, I bought a large but it was a large 3 times my size. I had to get it taken in and have worn it twice since. Today I picked it up to wear and the zipper to the front is spoilt.

Do not recommend"
"Worked for one day, received on 8/25 by the next day it was only turning for one minute then stop. This after turning it off, settings changed and unplugged for 10 minutes. This model is the supposed to be the upgraded version.
I got the winder to charge 2 Automatic Montblanc watches, it was able to partially charge one before the malfunction occurred.
The winder is well presented and solid, the overall quality is good, too bad it did not work. I will look for another brand.
Ended up returning it at the end it just turned for one minute. Get another brand."
watch came with dead battery!
"I really liked these boots - had originally given them four stars. I purchased them in January so didn't really use them until spring (a few times) and now again this fall.  Unfortunately, I put them on this morning and the vinyl began to crack at the ball of my foot and continued to crack so now they are totally unusable. Returns are no longer possible because outside the window, which is unfortunate for a product that one only uses occasionally.  So after a few uses, they are totally useless!

Update: I tried numerous other boots and came back to these, but it has happened again - I love the way these boots fit but they don't last!  With just a few time wearing in normal conditions they have split on both sides of the toe boxes.  Again, this is a problem.  This is the second pair of boots that I have ordered."
The width of the shoe near the toe area is narrow and there is horrible toe cleavage. Other than that this is one of the first brands that I have found with such a short heel and comfortable insoles.
I bought these for a friend who is just belove average height and in great shape and these were too short for her
"Sent in custom measurements but the dress still did not fit.  When this was brought up to the seller they said we should get it altered (at our own expense).  The color was not what expected, the pattern on the dress was not what was expected and it was requested that it have the V cut neckline and the dress did not have this. The only nice thing was the buttons in the back. Now we have a wedding dress that won't get used and had to go buy another one for the wedding."
"These are way too large and of inferior quailty. If they were not so inexpensive i would have returned them to the seller. They will be used to dust furniture. Gold toe used to be high quaility line, that has changed."
The cups were literally a size A! Fits well in width but the cups are way too smal!
"Love the shoe, its jsu"
"Tight around the headline, and tall...way to tall like weaing a dunce cap. Worst hat ever."
"I ordered two, one medium and one large and neither fit well. The medium was too small. The back also looked very awkward. I wouldn't recommend this corset."
"Once I got the right fit, these shoes are very comfortable.  I would order a half size wider, and a half size longer than usual."
"I ordered these for my daughter she loved them, but she wore them 3 times equaling not a full day and they ripped.  I hope I will get another pair to replace these."
"Like other reviewers stated, this product is very poor quality. The bag looks beautiful but the handle broke after less than a month of gentle, non-daily use. I gave this as a gift to my sister and am extremely embarrassed that the quality was so poor. Of course the return period had expired so now we are both out of luck. Very disappointed that Amazon would allow a product of this poor quality to be sold on their site."
"This is a really cool bag, and I was so looking forward to taking it to my next trip to Europe.  However, if you are petite....I am 5'2, it is WAY to big.  The height I could handle, but the width is 20 inches....way to big for a small framed-person to carry.  Disappointed, I had to return it."
"I've learned a valuable lesson: When ordering jeans, read the fine print.  I would have sworn there was no mention of a button fly; but when I received the jeans I went back and looked and there it was.  Since the last time I confronted a button fly was in the 1940s, I was not conditioned to be wary of inadvertently ordering such pants.  Levi's, there was a reason the button fly was replaced by a zipper.  The passage of time has not brought back the 'charm' of such an antiquated device.  If you're a septuagenarian as I am, with arthritic hands, DO NOT order these jeans."
"This is a nice scrub top but it is way too big!!! My boyfriend wears an XL in dickies and cherokee scrubs and he has a bit of a belly. This Landau XL is more of a 2XL or 3XL. It was so wide and long that it just hung off of him. If you like a boxy, loose scrub then order 1 size down. If you like a boxy snug fit, order 2 sizes down."
"The boots are cute, but the fit is really strange. They are wide on my feet and kind of slide when I walk. It's hard to describe, but it feels like my feet and bouncing up and down, as if I were stepping on a loose floor board with every step. It's really a nuisance."
It didn't come with any belly rings like my last order
"Very nice fabric, cute shirt but the cuffs/sleeves are oversized to the point of not being workable.  I'm going to cut off/hem the sleeves so it works as a summer shirt."
Way too large. Got a small and its more like a medium and its a bit old fashioned.
just to big - foot kept slipping out even when I got a smaller size.
"It's more of a red then burgundy.  Could not wear it, gave it too a friend"
This sleeper is not fitting how we were hoping for. The 3 toddler was too small for our 12 month old.
"I used it once and I know I get what I pay for, but to have the zipper malfunction on me the first time, is a joke. With that said, you pay for something cheap, you get something with cheap zippers. I really wish I could have given a better review."
"I liked how it fit length and width wise, but the right side shoe puts a pressure point on my big toe joint.  I didn't get pain from it until 2 days of wear, so I decided not to return the shoes since I've worn them outside.

Update 4/21/18.  I wore them and walked 1 mile.  Every joint from my hip down to my toes were shooting pain.  The arches no longer felt supportive.  I can't wear the shoes again."
Strap broke after only a couple of wears and the right shoe came unglued.
Definitely didn't work for me - I know it has a lot of great reviews but for me it just didn't work. I returned it.
"I normally wear 8 to 8.5  I bought an 8.5 and they're really small.  I'd go up a half size from your largest possible shoe size because these are really small.  Cute shoes though.  If you wear your shoes barefoot, you can probably get your largest normal size."
"Quality of fabric and workmanship good, but it's a funky fit."
Photo Shows full black shoe but actual is listed as the orange and black shoe this needs to be corrected asap
"fits but designed poorly. proportions are all wrong: straps too wide, cut into armpit area, sags in bust area, too short in back. Other suits from this brand fit very well sad this one is a failure"
Color was much darker than pictured and way too big for my wrist.
Little thin material will not last long
"flimsy bag, pull out handle not strong enough , seems like it will break or not lock in place with use, it flips when pulling it so be careful you don't twist  your hand in the process; all the clothes fall to the bottom in a ball; I was afraid the zippers wouldn't hold up, worse purchase ever; I saw other people in the airport with duffle bags, their handles were metal, this is plastic, buyer beware."
"I ordered these shoes for my Mom who had total knee replacement surgery.  She takes an 8 but I ordered the 8.5 based on reviews that people found them to run small.  They were still too small....the minute she tried them on her toes were squished, although she seemed to have room in the heel.  Yes, they can be adjusted but that still didn't help with the toes.  They appear to be comfortable...nice and soft.

I had to send them back.  You better be sure to order the correct size as you pay for the return shipping....PLUS they will deduct their original shipping cost along with a 20% re-stocking fee.  I don't blame the seller for this as it takes their time and cost, but just want you to be aware that when you pay $57.05 for the shoes and you return them you will ultimately be out almost $30.00 (shipping them back to seller plus their shipping and restocking fee)."
Product sucks!!!
I am a small person and by no means have a large head but this cute hat is quite small.
way too small horrible company
I received the item and found that my new passport with the RFID in the cover would not fit in the slot.  I pulled out my old passport and it fit perfectly.  So if you have an RFID (US) passport.  This is not the item you want.
Very clingy and baggy.
"These do not fit .
shirt came with big hole in side seam not good thermal set"
"They are very constricting in general, but the ankle band opening is extremely tight and has almost no give to it. Originally I got these to walk around out on the patio with but I can't wear them at all without it affecting foot circulation."
"We bought it, saw it and sent it right back. There's a big hole in the side seam.. so quality is already shoddy, before even wearing it. If you live in a warm climate, don't buy it. It's very warm material. It's one piece, which is not that bright - I mean, most toddlers are still in diapers, right.. Doesn't make for an easy diaper change. Also, my son is 2 - and it was way too big... I got the size 2-4."
"Less than 3 months and the handle of this purse is fraying and falling apart. Very disappointed because of the price you'd think it would last longer. See attached pictures, purse is defective would like NineWest to replace in kind."
"One of my shoes came exactly as described, the other was a lighter brown. I have two different color high fashion shoes."
"Too large, too wide, so my feet ""go forward"" in front of the slippers. Memory foam went down within the first 30 minutes of wearing the slippers, and never bounced back. There is no arch support. Will never buy this brand again."
The waist was to small and I couldn't use the button hole
got a large but the chest part was still a little too small. plus the material seemed really cheap.
"I love the look of these shoes but they run sooooooo small.  I am a size 10 in everything (boots, shoes, sandles).  I tried 3 different FLY London styles trying to get something to fit, even went up to a size 11 and I still couldn't squeeze my foot it. and believe me I tried!!!!  so disappointing."
It faded quickly and the shirred work begins to sag.  Yikes.
Received these and they were too big and very poor quality. provably the worst shoes I have received from amazon.
Cheap material- made feet look black. What the...
Wasn't what I expected material wise. Looks a lot cheaper than the pic.
"Sadly I had to return these, although these are well made sandles, the toe strap was very tight, and I have a small foot."
"This is Ralph's wife.  The bottom was a review written around the time that I bought these.  I treated the leather with oils and moisture protectants, but the next season I tried them on and they'd shrunk.  My feet still measure the same.  I threw them out.  I have had no luck with any Clark shoe or boot.  They never have arch supports of any mention.  The shoes I'd bought had had stitching and the knots were tied on the inside, which irritated my feet over time.  There were two pair of shoes like this.  I will never purchase Clarks again and think they are way overpriced for what you get.

Please remember I purchased these on size up so my arch supports fit in them.  After one season they were too tight even without those arch supports.

When I purchased this boot it was said to be waterproof and I believe it is.  This boot has room around the top for thick socks or a light slack to be stuffed in if need be.  The sole is rugged and good for snow.  The zipper starts down low to allow your foot to slip in more easily.  My one caveat, the reason why I did not give it five stars, is that once your foot is in there is not adequate cushioning inside and virtually no arch support.  I solved this problem by going up one full size and inserting one of the new Dr. Scholl's Active Series Replacement Insoles.  This boot is now amazingly comfortable.  I don't know if all women go through this, but I try on a lot of shoes or boots, usually, before I can find a pair that I'm happy with.  I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend them."
"There is no ""Cush"". It's no different than walking on concrete barefoot."
"These boots looked darling when my daughter put them on, but she complained that they were painful in the toe and the boots were too hard for me to feel if the boot was too small.  When I went to return the item I had to pay $9.00 shipping to sent it back.  Had I known how much it was going to cost me to return the boots I would not have ordered them in the first place."
Too large. I needed them by a certain time for pictures and it was a waste of money and time. I ordered a US toddler size 8 and it fit more like a size 10.
Too small. Doesnt match the chart.
It's cute but the jewelry is way too heavy especially if your piercing isn't completely healed. I put this on 6 months after having my belly pierced and it hurt so much every time I sat down so I had to take it out. The metal is also fake or is dirty because I got an infection after from this.
i ordered a large it came a small it took forever to come so i just donated it
"Usualy im 9.5....this shoes ius to large, maybe 0.5 more. And is very very narrow. The leather is very good and look great"
This is not a  Ginuwine Bulova . You can go to the Bulova website .  And compare !!!! Pick is a screenshot from original Bulova websites.
"I ordered 2 pairs of these pants. The first order I kept as I do like the pants. However, I ordered Tundra and the color was OD Green upon arrival. I ordered the second pair with the same color as the first, Tundra, but received Green once again.. The display pictures show Khaki, Green, and Tundra. The Tundra is supposed to be brown, as dipicted in the pictures.
I am disappointed with the difference between what the colors are displayed and what you actually reeive. I sent the second pair back for a refund."
not as expected very small and cheap
"I ordered the size I usually wear and after reading they true to size fit, I was confident... When I got them they were the size I ordered BUT to small. After spending the money I was disappointed. I will try to purchase again but not via online. It's probably a good idea to try them on first."
"Although the description clearly states bra, there is not a bra."
Broke in the first week. Very delicate. Not for everyday use
These are NOT the same quality as the sport socks!!! I ordered 4 pkgs of these thunking they were the same thing as gold toe sport socks (which are wonderful and last over twice as long as any other sock ive ever bought for my boys) and with the month they already had holes in them! Save your money and don't buy the athletic gold toe sock:(
"The shirt was small and clingy.  Not flattering.
It was thinner material that would not hold up long.  I returned it."
Dye transferred to my hands. No good. Cute from a far.
"My wife purchased this for me as a birthday present at Macy's last February for around $150.00 so that I would have a nice leather bag to carry my notebook around in.

Although this was a nice looking bag new, with age the leather finish has faded and has developed small speckled spots in the black leather, most likely a result of a poor tanning process and cheap dye job.

It has never been abused or left in a car or in direct sunlight, and just developed those defects as it aged.

It is not really a bag for a laptop or a notebook. The description in the paperwork that came with the bag stated that it will hold up to a 15"" laptop, but this bag really has no padding to protect one. If you're looking for a bag to haul your laptop or notebook around in, it was a nice bag when new, but it failed to keep that attractive look and looks lumpy now after just two uses.

Pros . . .
The leather was nice and soft when received.

Cons . . .
Not really designed to protect either notebooks or laptops.
The carrying strap is braded nylon, not leather.
The black dye fades, white spots, almost like mold, developed in the leather, and the leather scuffs very easily.
The inside compartment spaces are too small for some items that are supposed to fit in them.
The front flap is secured by magnets and not a zipper, and doesn't hold the flap closed very well.
It's too small for most laptops and some notebooks, and is poorly designed and constructed.

I really don't have a use for it now so it has become a closet queen, and it looks shabby after less than a year, and only being used twice."
"I will not be purchasing these again. Like the title says, you get what you pay for. These offer so support (which was expected), they run way to easily, and forget it if you accidently wash them. They are also really dark, so if you are light skinned like me they will look off."
tarnished after a couple months
"Fast shipping.  I really didn't want to give a bad review on these super cute shoes.  I ordered a 9 and wear an 8.5 in heels.  They are too big (by a lot) and I would like to return them as soon as possible.  I received them last night and tried them on. I do not have wide feet, but these shoes are very narrow-my feet were hanging out the sides of the shoes. The leather is nice material, the zipper in the back of the heel hurt really badly standing and walking in them.  the heel height is not bad, they are sort of uncomfortable standing and walking in them.  I do not recommend them, although they are very cute in the picture."
"The size of the pants ran small. I take a 34"" waist and it was more like a 32"". I returned the pants rather than reorder in a larger size which may have fit or not due to shrinkage. I like Dickies and wear their jeans all the time but these were different in construction and fit."
Insanely too small. I normally wear a medium top and the large is too right. Disappointing.
Nice colour awful fit
Did not like the fit.  Too small. returned.  Although it is very good quality.
stays wrinkled.  It won't hold it's shape.
They were also just too be-jeweled
"I am a 34DD I ordered the S/M and yes it fit but it offers zero support. My jugs just slide around inside this bra.  The back is super cute, so I am very disappointed that it can't contain my girls."
Ordered these shoes as x wide and they are not. Used size chart be web site and ordered per size indicated. I very dissatisfied as they hurt my feet. Would not recommend if you have wide feet.
"I attempted to order according to the size chart, but the skirt came much larger than I expected. Hoping it would shrink and that a belt would help solve the problem I decided to keep it.... what a mistake. The elastic band came apart only a few hours into my work day and I had to search for safety pins to avoid a seriously embarrassing wardrobe malfunction, as it was now several inches too large and falling down even with a belt. I'm going to try to take apart the seem of the waist to re-close and tighten the elastic, and hopefully that will work, but even for what I paid I'm disappointed by the quality. I'd expect a skirt to last more than 3 hours of wear."
"These scrubs are made weird/wrong. The front is bulky and it feels like on the back the seam down the middle goes to the right. It feels like your pants are on crooked all day long! I ordered XL size and the pants fit but the shirt is huge! For reference I am 160lbs and 5'4"". This entire scrub set is not flattering at all! This scrub set will be my last resort scrubs when the rest are being washed. These are NOT MedPro, instead they are a brand I never heard of called Greentown or Metroscrubs. Most likely some Asian/Chinese company. They are horrible scrubs! False advertising for these scrubs. If you are going to sell something make sure it is correct and done right. It is annoying to purchase something and it is not as advertised. I will never ever purchase again!!"
These look better in the picture. They are very wide. If you have a wide foot these will be perfect for you
Opened the package and it was broken.
I thought this would help with all the glaring lights at night.  It just made everything yellow and still had the glare with the yellow tint.  Did not work for me.
The heel didn't feel right. Maybe a call back.
Bag size is small will probably give as a gift for christmas
"I love these, but my problem is that I'm well endowed in the backside and these were not made for that. So I haven't been able to wear them. Ladies if you have junk in your trunk skip these."
"I don't like the style, it's not as expected from looking at the picture. Too large on the waist, ok on the top."
the ankles are too small and tight. not comfortable for kids.
"Hated it! If you are full-figured, stay away from this shirt. It does not hang well and leaves you looking either pregnant or about 30 lbs. heavier."
"I don't ""hate"" them but they are way too big.  I will give them to another person.  I ordered a size 9 ( I usually wear a 9.5) but I probably should have ordered a size 7.  Yuck."
I wear Crocs all the time but this style was very disappointing. Not a true size 9 and not comfortable. I had to return them.
Horrible quality.  I've gotten better check books free from my bank.  I was very disappointed.
Not satisfied with quality of back pack. Kids have been in school only a few weeks and showing signs of separation. Do not recommend.
"I hate how this supports me and the way it looks when on.
Lesson learned... spend more for better quality."
TOO TIGHT FOR A 10-D
"This was a super cute shoe it just runs really small, If you can buy a whole size up."
i found these gloves very cheap looking
These swallowed my feet whole.  They are too wide and fight horribly.
This shoe hurt the side of my right foot wear the seam is.
"Band fit fine, cup size was far too large.  I am a 32G/34FF in Freya/Cleo bras, and 32G had incredibly large gaps at the top of the bra.  It was returned."
How long do you think the fingers need to be?? Mine are barely half way up the length of the finger and they flop over.  If I buy this size in leather they fit perfectly - these are men's gloves being portrayed as women's gloves
"They look fake, they are pretentious and I had to  separate it to two different earrings"
wish they felt better
"I've  been  looking forward to these boots since I ordered them... especially since it has been raining  every day since!  They arrived about  an hour ago and I'm already unimpressed!  They run large, which I expected, but I though this would be great since I planned on wearing them with thick socks... still  way too large.

The sole comes out, the metal pieces are pretty grungy  looking, and overall  they appear to be cheaply made. I'll be ordering a different pair as I need something to withstand  daily use for walking the dogs.  This is a classic case of getting what you pay for."
"Too small. Too short . Too revealing for busty women. I'm a size 8/10 and ordered a medium--too tight and not flowy like most maxi dresses. Fits more like a column dress. I Am 5'3"" with an hourglass shape and this barely made it to my ankles. However I am a  36G so that could be part of the reason but this made me look like a stripper, it was so low cut. I tried it with a tank under and it was cute. Straps wide enough to wear a thin strapped tank. You would need to wear a shaper underneath since it is so thin unless you like that visible panty line look. I liked the print and the material felt cool so it is a nice weight for summer."
Not quality material so I returned it.
"I purchased two different pairs of ex officio briefs.  The main reason for my purchase was the available free returns.  I placed the items in my wishlist hoping for a better price.  I got a message stating the price had dropped so I placed the order.  I received the brief and the waistband is very thin and uncomfortable.  The middle of the brief is very loose and baggy.  Bottom line, this is a very poor fitting brief.  I went to return the item and this pair is no longer listed as free returns.  I am returning the other pair, but for some reason, I can't return these.  This is a poor business practice.  Buyer beware."
"I, like others, thought this was a navy blue sweater. It's black knit. The first picture is different from the third pic, which is the actual product. Very deceptive."
"The picture is so inviting.  I bought them several months ago and was so disappointed.  They are very small, appropriate for a child. Also, the stone is pale.  I kept them buy only wore them once.  I saw them again when doing my wish list for Christmas, and bought them with gift card money.  When they arrived I couldn't believe I had been fooled twice by the same beautiful picture!  I sent them back this time."
"have had docker's sox before, hoping that these would be the same.  I think they are the same 'style' but the quality has sagged as do the sox. they really stretch out- so sad"
I've purchased this shoe before so I reordered and ended up with a less quality pair of shoes. They're not the same
"This hat is signifcantly smaller than the UA stretch fit it was replacing. The hats are the same size, but the newer crown is much lower profile which changes the fit noticeably (for someone like me with a big dome)"
Too large for a toddler - it was too large for me as an adult even
The shirt is beautiful but I ordered an extra large and my niece who is a size 6 said it was too small for her.
"Way too small, doesn't fit despite being adjustable"
"I've worn these a few times... but never any where that I know I'll be walking. These sandals are super cute!! I was so excited to get them too, bc they are the quality I expect from MIA as well... but the completely flat bottoms make these shoes awkward to walk in - and I'm not a wimp when it comes to heels, for the record.
For the price, eh... I wish they were a little more 'everyday'... but alas, they're in my 'photo-ops only' collection  :(  Practicality: fail. Sorry, MIA  :("
"The Coat fit great on my son was warm for the first time using it.  Then noticed the zipper had teeth falling out if it and now after unzipping and zipping it a few times, the zipper unzipps itself in essence making the coat worthless."
I ordered nude and got faded out peach - ugly!
"These used to be a  very good sock brand. We purchased them at Penny's for years, but they no longer sell the Cushion Foot Fluffie.  We were hoping that these were the same socks that Gold Toe used to make, but sadly the quality has gone down substantially. There is almost no cushion in the heel or foot area and the socks are incredibly thin. Unfortunately there appears to be no substitute from another manufacturer."
Not durable at all. Back strap broke off. Was only glued on. Very squeaky and noisey shoe also. Very disappointing..
"This infinity scarf, I could not wrap to look like picture... too loose... did not look well, or feel right"
"Because I have other Levis that size and they aren't that snug. Also, in the crotch area the jeans have a tear in them. I didn't notice this until after I washed them."
sizes runs smalll!!! big loss on return money!!!
The wig was terrible and huge i had to sew it to fix ti to fit her. it was disappointing this was not a cheap costume and a waste very sad
"Want to send this back, was too small for any adult head!!!!"
Received item but too small.
"Who wouldn't love a pocket just for their phone?
Me, apparently.
The pants themselves seemed fine, but the cut was weird compared to other Grey's scrubs. The legs & hips fit fine, but the waistband gapped enough in the back that I could have carried a watermelon back there while standing upright, and boy it got drafty when I gave them the squat test... Pulling the drawstrings did nothing.
So goodbye sweet phone pocket, returning these for my tried and true 4232's.
(for reference - I ordered a Medium, same as I always wear in Grey's.. I'm 5'7, 27 waist, 38 hip, 23 thigh)"
"Too bad it's out of the return window date. I was waiting until the warm weather to wear it. Well, now it's here and the band came off its sockets, or whatever you call it, when I was putting it on today. It cost a lot in the sense that one penny is too much for this pretty piece of junk. Looks aren't everything."
"I ended up returning this product.  While it was written in the description, I didn't notice it at the time of purchase.  This is sterling silver over bronze, not solid sterling.  The whole thing looked a bit cheap.  There are much better deals out there for the price."
Nice and warm. The material wears on other fabrics. I wore my purse with it and the fabric from the coat was all over my shoulder bag....
"The shoe is floppy on my foot.  I have many other Ahnus in this same size and I have not had this problem.  Sadly, I missed the return date."
"I expected the actual quality to be somewhat less than the photo due to the low price, but the downgrade is severe. In reality it's low quality material and it doesn't drape or fold the way it looks in the picture. A lot of things are posed ""just so"" to make them look better than they are, but this is so different in overall appearance that one wonders if it's the same shape and sewing as in the photo."
My leggings came with a run. I could not wear them.
"I'm Disappointed, I followed directions for washing, but they shrank and are shaped weird. The forms in the cups don't come out and are now warped."
"It  fits quite well, but honestly it had started flaking off the paint after the second day of use. Because of that, I can't reccomend it."
"My husband hated this ring, lightweight and scratched terribly."
Very tight around the ankles but otherwise very good quality product
its trash broken
Disappointed in this check book cover due to it having no slots to put ID or credit cards
Well made shoes but ordered a Sz 1 white and received a pink Sz 8.5??!
"Disappointed in these leggings. Pros: they're super fuzzy and warm on the inside, cute color, seem sturdy. Cons: these are cut the strangest way. There are 2 parallel seams that run front to back in the crotch and butt (similar to men's boxer briefs), but there's no give in these seams. They made me look like I had 4 butt cheeks or an extremely large labia, the way they cut into my upper thighs. I'm not a large person (5'3"" 130lbs if you must know) so I can't imagine these being very flattering on most people."
"They are much smaller than expected.  They are great stretchy material, very soft.  As others have said good for around the house or pjs but not good for working out unless you are very small and skinny already."
sleeves are cut slanting up.  i hate that and still don't wear it
Top fit very poorly.
I was very disappointed. It is not made very well and the hat is a hard material and can not be shaped to fit the head.
"This is the ugliest pair of shorts I ever bought. In the picture they look fitted, but in reality there's so much extra material in the crotch it looks ridiculous. I couldn't even give these away."
First time trying to insert back of checkbook the leather ripped at the seems. They sent the wrong color and the plastic insert to keep from writing through to the other checks through the carbon copy is too small. Save your money and go to the local store to see what is a better product.
Price is laughable. It should be price correctly from the start. Paying list price would be a complete rip off.
The front end of the shoe is boxy and non conforming. I have narrow feet. It was not a good fit for me. I wear a 9.5 in ballet flats and heels and ordered a 9 and 10 to try them out. The size 10 was humongous and the 9 was a smidge too small. It would not have been confortable for me to wear all day so I returned them.
Was not the best that I have had.  The ribs bones were not very supportive as expects.
Did NOT fit right in the Crotch Area and in the Waist!  ---  Use AMERICANS to size these - Not foreign employees ---  JEFF
"These broke as soon as they arrived, which is a shame as they are beautiful in person..I wanted to exchange, but they only offered a refund."
Great shoe but the straps were missing making it impossible to walk in. I didn't know who to contact.
Cheaply made I wouldn't bother
Tore apart on first use.
"Didn't try it on as I ordered a long sleeved version and the short sleeve was sent. The other black one didn't fit at all, so I am assuming this is not as advertised"
"... of the completely disappointed.  I bought these to make some jewelry for Mothers Day for family, and out of all the pieces will only be able to use about five or so.  Poorly moulded glass, cracked glass, missing grommets, scratched glass, etc., etc.  They say you get what you pay for, and this was a cheap purchase.  Lesson learned.  Won't buy again."
"I ordered these because the ones one size up, were too big,  these were too small.  I like how they look but not how they fit. Never had an issue with sizes this is my first case."
"These were perfect.  They fit over the thigh and not at the knee which isn't flattering to the leg.  Just ordered another pair.  These are what you're looking for.

EDIT: I purchased two more pairs that fit at the knee.  The white and red fit as they should.  The green and white and white/green do not fit above the thigh."
"Incredibly big. My wife usually use 8.5 sneakers. Ordered 7 due to the reviews and these are to big. The deal is that Im outside usa and cant return it. I just wasted $70usd. Wont recommend.
Package totally apart."
This shoes are horrible DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY.
The rings only fit one finger at the top. The rest fly off. They should have made them adjustable or provided different sizes.
"The shirt is great, but it shrank significantly after one washing and now it no longer fits my son. Ugh. Buy a size bigger."
tight sleeves and hangs kinda funny.
"I've worn a 42D bra for years, so I ordered a 42D.  It was so tight it made red marks on me where the band went.  It was awful!  I returned it.  Dont buy it!!!"
"runs small. i wear a 14 and these feel like a 10 or 12. returning and going up a size. definitely not amercia sizing. unless you have a slim body frame, then your true size may fit. I have larger hips and legs so this definitely did not fit me. I do however like the jeans."
"Quality not that great. Jeans feel very thin and cheap. Smelled horrible. Washed them several times. Even hung them out to dry. The dyes the company uses smells so bad. You would think after several washes and air drying, that would help. They were sized weird and small."
Poor quality skirt. I found a better one with nicer tulle at forever 21. It also runs super small. I'm normally a size medium or large in skirts. I bought the extra large to be safe and it was way too tight.
"More like a cheap costume you'd expect to find at Walmart rather than a nice dress that's pictured. Costume looked nothing like the picture. Got it to wear to a 20's themed wedding, but once I received it, there was no way it would hold up to a day long wedding and dancing reception."
"I purchased these for my boyfriend.  He wanted another Ariat work boot.  I didn't realize that these had steel toes in them.  The boot is really heavy.  I wish in the short description of the boot that they said ""Steel Toed Boot"".  What a disappointment.  Had to send them back.  He never even tried them on so I have no idea regarding the sizing."
"I can't believe you actually sent this!!!! It was stuffed into a very small bag all wrinkled, no tags at ALL and I could tell it had already been washed! I would have returned it but needed in my wardrobe. I know all of this as this was my second purchase of this exact shirt. The first was perfect, this one, not so much!"
"Terrible quality, I wouldn't suggest this to anyone"
"Terribly disappointed, that they didn't fit.."
"Leather is stiff, not what was expected. I will be returning."
"Im not sure who these would fit. They are pretty true to size, maybe a bit slim fitting, but they are so incredibly long. My son is on the tall side, slim to average build, and these went down to almost his ankles. These are made for skinny giants."
These are real rabbit feet!! You can get a fake one for the same effect without killing an innocent rabbit. That is so wrong!
"Took forever for delivery, a month!  Looks cheap and flimsy in person. The print over the tye dye is tacky, not nearly what is pictured."
"This is the waste money that I did starting the year, the material is terrible, for less money I can buy a better quality in Aeropostale or old navy."
"The quality of these shoes was so poor, I didn't even wear them once. The sole of the shoe is too narrow to fit a normal foot, and the insides of the shoe are rough textured and uncomfortable. Do not waste your money on this product; it will NOT come to you looking like it does in the picture."
Easy get ripped
"Very uncomfortable shoe, no padding. Feet hurt terribly. No comfort @ all. Hugh disappointment. Not worth price!!"
"Sorry to say that these panties did not provide the support that I was looking for. And, they are fairly thin as well. Might work well on others, just was not for me."
"not sized well too long and way too narrow.
I won't wear"
"It's as short as you wanted (above the knee) but too WIDE, if you have thin legs do not buy it"
"The fabric is soft and thin. I like the fact that it is made from modal, a fiber made from bamboo. This is a better version ofmodal because it doesnt pill like older versions of modal.  However, I found the front pouch to be a little silly. It has an elephant trunk like design for your penis. I'd feel silly wearing this at the gym. I think it would be much better if it's redesigned with a regular pouch and offered a better selection of colors."
Got it in time but was not what I expected. The sleeves were the right length for a large but the length of the shirt itself was not long like I like.  The feel of the shirt is comfortable but too tight. The graphics don't have a sticky feeling which is a plus.  If you wear a large I would suggest the next size up.
"Pros:
 Offers amazing control top!
 Material is lovely and thick.
 Interior pocket fits my iPhone 5s (vertically).
 Great for running, stretching, weight lifting. Definitely my favorite pants!!

Cons:
See attached picture. Seam came undone after less than 5 washes :-("
Very comfortable and went easily with all different outfits. Only had for 3 weeks and the soles got wet and started falling apart.
"I am pleased with the appearance of the shoe, but it is much too wide.  I wear a AA width and have tried little inserts, but it is not effective."
smaller and much lighter than I expected- not worth the price- I can buy same quality for half the price retail-
Wayyyy too small.  Order 3 sizes up!
Too tight. I am 5'8 140 pounds. The medium size hurt my waist area especially when I put my arms up in the air as a test to see if I can move around with the shirt.
Too small even though all other brands fit in this size.
They both faced the same way which was weird for earrings. Not happy with them and they were a gift . :-(
"Cheap, horrible product. Do not buy from them."
Not very comfortable and slipped off easily ... thin sole ... wouldn't wear them outdoors.
"At first, I ordered these in an extra large for my husband that typically wears a 36, since I noticed that the reviews had indicated that the fit was a little small, and knowing he'd be wearing these over pants, I thought I had made the right decision with sizing up. When he tried them on, they were MUCH too large, so we returned them and I ordered him the large (the size chart listed a large as between 34 and 38). Well, these are going back because they are much too small. We just couldn't win with these snow pants..."
The sizing has changed. This is my usual size in these jeans and they were WAY too small. Very disappointed.
Just not what I expected and provided no support.
I ordered a XXL and it would fit an 5 year old!
These were horribly sized. Loved the color and style but these are sadly going back due to fact that they're WAY too small. Held them up to citizens of humanity jeans marked in the same size and these are over an inch in the waist smaller.
"I am extremely upset. I had worn these shoes exactly twice since I bought them as I usually reserve them for when I wear trousers to work. Yesterday, I decided to wear them for the 3rd time and before I could even walk out of the house, the decorative buckle on the right side broke off! It just snapped and flipped to one side. I expected MUCH better quality from Naturalizer. I just want to toss these shoes now because its now too late to return them. POOR QUALITY!"
"I was very disappointed with these socks, and I wouldn't recommend them even if they cost half as much as they do. Yes, they say right in the title that these socks have NON-elastic tops, but I still didn't expect them to fall down to my ankles all the time. I have slightly larger than average calfs, and because these are long enough to rise to mid-calf level, I figured they'd stay in place, but no. So if you're wearing them as dress socks and you're sitting down with your legs crossed, your pants will naturally rise a few inches and show everybody that your socks are crumpled around your ankles. Not a good look.

Plus, they're very thin, so they provide no warmth, comfort or cushion. Most ribbed dress socks are the same, but at least the other thin dress socks I own don't fall down to my ankles. I often buy black dress socks with a thicker feel and more cushion, which can double as casual socks with jeans, but I do often wear thin, ribbed dress socks with slacks or a suit. These would be my last choice, because they won't stay up."
It is TINY!  The pictures online make it look bigger than it is. The words are VERY difficult to read because of the small size.  The whole point of buying this bracelet is for the encourage writing but when it's so small that you need a magnifying glass to read it then it's pointless.  I would NOT buy it again.
"if your a big dude like me 6"" 240lbs don't buy... alot a guys say in there reviews  it fits them well and that there 6.2"" 250 lbs
well listen i workout  everyday and this sweater does not fit at all ."
very tight....hard to get bills into clip
Size was far off. I wear a zero gauge but these were far smaller than I needed. The quality is very good but this was a disappointing purchase.
"I bought one pair to see how they fit, and they were great.  Seamless, long, nice stretch.  Came back and ordered more pairs, and they are NOT the same ones.  Seams, blew out crotch, and I'm a size 18, not too big for them.  Totoally different product and quality.  Seriously frustrated."
"A seam came loose after one use and the fabric seems fairly lightweight, but have held up since purchasing. It was too much trouble to return and they were needed immediately, so we didn't bother."
I ordered a 16 but it fit like a large 18.
Really unhappy with this purchase. Costs a pretty penny just for one pair. When they came in the quality is terrible. Doesn't even look or feel like real silk! They fit weird too - bought as a gift - but they don't fit like boxers. They fit more like basketball shorts. Legs are way too long. Def would not recommend to other customers. They even had some pills already. Very poor.
Light and awful material. Not true to size.
Ordered brown-which is dark brown in picture and got a watered down tan at best. Awful. Also this shoe runs 1/2 size large. I am a firm 9 in shoes and the 9 in this shoe was waaaay to big...I ordered same shoe in black and it is the same story there...gotta return. Big let down.
"Band twists and face gets scratched up quickly., band fell apart after 2 months"
"This is a okay necklace. Very thin and light, where I prefer a sturdy and heavier metal."
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

These shirts are of such cheap quality that they are completely see through - even with an undershirt. There is no way they could be even a little professional. I even layered two exact same shirts (which I bought big on purpose) and an undershirt, and I could still see my skin underneath. On top of the super thin material, when I was trying them on - I noticed that already there were holes along the seams where stitching was poorly done."
"Totally fell apart the third time I wore it.
Oh, and the infinity symbol was tarnished pretty bad.
Too bad, because for the price, I didnt' think it would be as nice looking as it was....."
"This tiara looks pretty cute in the pic, however, when I received it unfortunately it was broken and the tiara itself is too heavy for the elastic headband. Is really not worth the $3."
"Had to return these because one shoe was much narrower than the other.  On the other shoe, the strap going around the heel was way too long.  Disapointing. Other than that I think they would have been nice shoes but I was afraid to try another pair."
I ordered it almost 4 sizes bigger and it's still WAY too small. It's worthless to send it back because you have to pay for shipping. DO NOT BUY.
These are cute shoes but they arrived and are way way way too small even though I ordered my regular size. Also they were dirty on the bottom so they were not new. Extreme disappointment. And there is no contact seller link so Im stuck with them. Terrible terrible service.
"I loved this shoes when I got them, they're comfortable, a little tight but nothing that loosen up the shoe laces can't fix but today after less than 6 months after purchase and minimal wear I found a hole in BOTH shoes. That is unacceptable, I rotate 6 pairs of shoes with the purpose that they all last for a long time and reebok completely disappointed. I do not recommend this shoes."
"Don't understand how these got all the good reviews. I ordered a half size smaller as several of the reviewers recommended. They were too small. So, I ordered my normal size. They fit, but were so uncomfortable.  They are cute for the price. But, did not work for me."
returning these. all you pay for is the Caterpillar name.  they have no padding in the ankle and are heavy as a brick.  i am going back to timberland pro. never wasting my time again.
"I had to do a little surgery on these before wearing them--no big deal, just a little annoying to have to fix things BEFORE wearing them."
Taps are too quiet. Shoes are not very good quality. Good for beginners. Not for professional use. Though I understand that I should have known better.
"This is a cute shoe in the picture and when you get it.  However, when I opened the box I knew it would be too narrow.  Even if you order a size up it will be too small.  I was really disappointed with this from Clark as I have several pairs of Clark shoes.  I had to return the shoes."
These are really thin and the elastic is very weak. Not at all like the old school cycling hats I'm used to. I'm keeping them because they're cheap and will work for awhile.
Even got it a size bigger than I wear and it still way too small
"The socks are too thin. There was no way I could tell from the on-line descriptions about the weight of the sock.  You use words like ""weekend"" etc.  I'd appreciate a straighter shot at what I'm buying. Please describe weight of the fabric somehow."
Washed one time shrunk so much can't wear it
"I would never recommend these based on the same issues others have reported. The heel slippage was terrible in every size I tried. I usually wear an 8.5M US and even going down a size didn't help. On the 8.5, my toes were hitting the end of the shoe and the heels were slipping off. Very disappointed because I've been happy with every other Keen shoe I've had. Just not a good design."
These felt like blue panty hose cut into a sock. Returned!
"For me, I didn't find they helped at all, very disappointed. I drive to work at night on highway & the headlights are getting to where they blind me. I really wanted these to work."
"Fits skin tight.  I did not care for such thin, clingy material and tight fit."
I've used 3X from FOTL and these were too tight
Didn't work as I had wanted.
Just ugly and cheap. Keep your money people!
comfortable but sole fell off after two weeks of ware
very small sizing way too narrow also does not support my foot as described
"VERY thin fabric; much shorter than expected for a ""long"" maxi."
Pourly made.
seems really cheap.  funky texture to the leather.
Worked for what I got them for and for one use. Very cheaply made.
Not what I expected not high quality
"these are made for infants, they are way to small for a young girl and certainly to small for an adult."
Broke the second day my daughter wore it.
"First of all they were pointy in the toe, not roomy like the go walk 2 or 3. Second there was a single line of cushions on the bottom of the shoe and it made my foot turn inwards. Very uncomfortable fit. Hated these, will go back to go walk 3."
"These boots are exactly as described. Fit is pretty exact. Just very tight on the calf. I do not have really wide calves. Hoping they will stretch as they are worn.

bought off season, so i will have to update when worn.

Wore these and thought the circulation in my legs stopped. Way too tight on calf.
will never wear again."
During 3rd time wearing the sole separated from top of shoes.
I would have loved this skirt if the sizing was correctly listed. Sad I had to return it.
"I have spend over $1,000 on Carhartt products during the last several years.  I have more than a dozen shirts of this exact style and each of them has varied in their cut.  Some shorter than the next, or the sleeves on one come down farther than the others, but these differences have not been enough to stop me from buying the next one.  This time however I was quite disappointed.  The sleeves were noticeably shorter, the overall length was so short that it barely tucks in far enough to stay through the day.  The torso was too wide and the pocket is almost poofy.  I just may try Craftsman for my next T-shirt.  I pay more for these shirts because of the quality and gladly so.  But quality is not just durability, it is also consistency.  I hold Carhartt to a higher standard.  So should they."
"The wig is nothing like the picture.  The color is different, the wig cap inside is big and not adjustable. When I took it out of the package lots of the hair just pulls from the wig and gets all over everything.  The top of the wig stays at a point because it's been in the flat package."
"The bad: I could lose some weight. Okay, a lot. I'm a size 14-16 right now. <insert sad little excuses here> I bought a size XL, but this is closer to a size M. Maaaaaybe a size L that's on the way smaller end of that size. Would send it back, but wasn't thinking and clipped the tags. Doh!

The good: The fabric is a lovely, soft, warm flannel. If you're thinking about getting this in a size S, maybe order a size L, size M for size XL, etc. This would still be a good purchase then, in my opinion."
Had to return these.  I have a very high instep and couldn't even get my foot into the shoe.  Would consider them if redesigned.  Very well made.
"I read the other reviews saying that this style ran small, so I sized up from a 39 to a 40.  They were too big - sloppy in the heel, loose in the toe box.  They were pretty cute, but I had to send them back.  Exchanging wasn't offered and the price has gone up almost $30.00 since I ordered them earlier in the week, so I won't be trying my correct size."
Ordered half size bigger and it was way too tight and uncomfortable. However I have the same size shoe in the houndstooth that fits just fine.
This I like but it fit too close.
"does not look like picture, cheap fabric"
I have received the pants but it is okay to me.
Did not keep because I didn't believe they'd ever be comfortable.
"32W 32L - not even close, and certainly not slim straight fit."
These shirts shrink in length. They are incredibly short after washing and drying. Not for me
dress was to small and the zipper kept getting stuck on the fabric I bought for a wedding and ended up dropping out because getting it altered would have been to much
"The fit was incredible! I'm 5"" 9' and about 155 pounds; the medium was perfect with a 4"" heel. The color was vibrant and pretty accurate to what is shown (teal).

Unfortunately, the fabric was so sheer that any style of undergarment was visible - down to the lace pattern. Couldn't see the color through the vibrant teal, but you can definitely trace all the lines.

Other colors might have different weights of fabric, but I'm not interested in ordering them all to find one thick enough for better coverage. I am returning this pair."
"I should have known better - It says&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Womens-Extra-Extra-Wide-Width-Adjustable-Slippers-VELCRO-brand-Diabetic-Burgundy-11/dp/B00NP4ZWQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Womens Extra Extra Wide Width Adjustable Slippers - VELCRO brand Diabetic & - Burgundy 11</a>&nbsp;but don't you believe it!  Yes, yes they are ""extra Wide"" velcro closures but what isn't obvious is the sole of the shoe is only  ""B"" wide so if your foot is more like a ""D"" or ""Tripple E"" width it is not a very stable platform for your foot!

The good news is that I was able to get a full refund from Amazon because of their return policy on these shoes.  I believe&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mens-Orthopaedic-EEE-Wide-Fit-Adjustable-Velcro-Slipper-Boot-Slippers-Navy-US-11/dp/B01CR6LFRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mens Orthopaedic / EEE Wide Fit Adjustable Velcro Slipper Boot / Slippers - Navy - US 11</a>&nbsp;which is a ""D"" width and a Mens shoe should work much better."
The watch did not when I received it as battery needed changing; the battery cover isn't fitting properly after cover was removed to change battery.
"I was very disappointed with myself for purchasing this. If I had looked carefully at the picture before buying I would have noted that there are only 3 spots to store a credit card and  In this day of store cards there is no extra card spots to keep them. The site for paper money is not very secure to keep money in, it slides out easily and is also in full view of standersby. The only manufacturing problem is that all the slots and paper bill site are very tight and difficult to slide cards and money into. The zipper is difficult to move back and forth and therefore makes the change pocket unusable.
I would like to have returned this but unfortunately started using it before a vacation and now that it is used can't be returned."
"They are very nice and light weight but they fit very tight. If your looking for a pair of lose fitting shorts, these are not it."
I was disappointed in the appearance of this top.
The wood stick  is super weak.  The wood broke right as I was placing it through my ear
"They aren't as pictured, there is no character on the ankle as pictured"
It's not genuine leather.
Very thin material. I bought the pink one and you can see through it.
"I shopped online for sneakers for a week straight.  I was so happy to find these but as soon as I opened the box I was a bit disappointed as the colors are different than what the pic depicts.  The pink is so pink that it looks more red against the very shiny black rest of the shoe.  I bought this shoe for the pink accents but they just aren't so pretty in person.  Okay, so I could have gotten past the color difference, BUT when I put these shoes on my feet the balls up to my toes turned numb within no more than 10 minutes of putting them on!!!  The shoe seems to fit just fine.  I'm an 8.5 in every shoe I wear & these were an 8.5 & felt just fine, until the numbing of my feet!  I don't have wide feet either, pretty slender actually.  I've never had this experience with any other shoe in almost 40 years of wearing shoes.  What a bummer!  I took the shoes off, the numbness goes away, I put the shoes on & the numbness returns.  Needless to say I am returning these shoes.  I really like the way the Asics look so I'm going to try a pair of those.  I must say though that Amazon was lightening fast with shipping as I received these shoes the very next day!!!  You Rock Amazon!!!  I also have new shoes on the way before these are even picked up by UPS without paying any more money!!  I LOVE Amazon.  You can't go wrong with them:)  If you shop a lot like I do, the Prime membership really, really, really pays off!!"
"Nice shoes, they are just too narrow and hurt my feet. I have always purchased 114E and they always fit. I don't know why these shoes were made smaller than most other 114E."
Too large and looks cheap
"I thought the pants was trouser fit, but leg is tight at bottom"
it runs small and the material is really cheap
"DO NOT BUY.. CAME IN WRONG SIZE AND DOES NOT LOOK LIKE SHIRT IN PICTURE, ITS A REGULAR TEE WITH A SCREEN PRINTED PICTURE, WORST THING I'VE BOUGHT ON AMAZON, IT TOOK OVER 3 WEEKS TO ARIVE!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IS A SCAM"
The logo is very small - NOT as pictured.  It is only about 6 inches across the middle.  Pretty disappointed.  The fit is fine and the material is soft.
"I returned these.  They did not feel right on my feet.  The tongues in the shoe slipped out of place and one had a crinkle at the base which hurt my foot.  I suspect that these were seconds or irregulars, but I could be wrong.  I tried them on at a Converse store and they felt a lot more comfortable."
So uncomfortable! The back panel essentially give you a boob wedgie after 5 minutes! It also looks ridiculous once that occurs. I hate this bra.
"I just got these today.
I opened them and was truly disappointed.
With the alignment of the strings the eye patch doesn't fit your face right.
Also, despite the image showing an older girl wearing them they will not fit adults well.
Tight strings and flimsy felt. I am not pleased."
"Super disappointed. I'm giving 2 stars only because my husbands shirt held up better than mine. Initially they both looked adorable, but they didn't stay that way. My shirt was clearly but pre-shrunk. It is super short in length now and I can't wear it. Total bummer of a purchase."
"very narrow.
""old boots look"", is not my taste."
Runs large and not supportive at all
"Cute, but, the one I got would only fit someone who wears an extra wide shoe and has pencil ankles.  The sole was the right width, but around the foot were extra, extra roomy, while the top ankle strap barely allowed me to zip it."
"Too small and short in torso, would not cover chest properly."
"This is my first pair of cheap tevas,  I have owned 4 other types. The best is no longer made. These run small. Are cheap,  but functional"
"It's beautiful and clearly well-made, but nowhere near accurate in size (U.S.) in either the numeric size or the weight chart. I'll be giving it to someone it will actually fit. I hate the idea of it going to waste.

To be fair, the delivery time was as advertised and it was very well packaged."
"My grandson is 4 month old and these Gerber Baby 2 pack sleep N play zip front sport , blue/ white , 6-9 months just fit with no room to grow, very disappointed."
The product was a at-least 1 size small.
ALOT bigger than they look. Don't like em.
For the price it's ok. Looks better on photo. Looks very manly. No style. The strap looks cheap. Wish I returned it but not worth the expense and effort.
I ordered a 4T. What I received was a 4T according to the label but this fit like a 3T. It likely won't last the summer. Disappointing as it is a cute shirt. I would recommend ordering the next size up.
"Not very durable. We have only had the umbrella a few weeks and the frame that runs through the middle has bent and had to be straightened out. I'm hoping it lasts awhile, but at this rate I'm not thinking it will"
"I had to return this. I'm not sure what sort of model they used when designing this dress, but I followed the size chart and this did not fit well at all. I'm 5'3"", 135 lbs, 36"" bust and got a M. It felt big up top and just awkwardly loose around the waist. I might have been able to make this work with an alteration, but I did not find this was made with very good material; it was very thin. I will say however, the delivery was prompt and I was very satisfied with that."
I have wide feet. These boots are just too narrow to fit my feet.
Dress material was ok but I do believe the waist is too short!!
"Very pretty shoe, but I can't get it to fit. I normally wear an 8 C/D, sometimes 7 1/2. In this shoe 8 and 7 1/2 C/D were both way too long/big. Tried a 7 C/D and they were too small (both length & width)."
My children are 3 and 5  (size Toddler 11 shoes) and these socks just fit their feet.  I do not feel they would fit 6-8 year olds.  The socks are Very Cute
"Its ok but it does bend out of its original shape, if you put the slightest pressure it will bend"
"Photo does not show well enough that the black is actually black with white polka dots. The photo makes it appear red and black, and the description says nothing about white polka dots on the black. I was not amused when I saw the actual product."
"i don't know why but for some reason these aerosoles didn't fit,
i just received a pair of red 10m from another place and they
fit nicely, too bad the pic does nothing for how beautiful these
sandals really are, but i had to return them."
Very uncomfortable. I got the patent leather in black. Its a pain in the butt to put on the straps. I wear 4-5 stilettos on a daily basis. These shoes kill me in less than an hour. Even after I put gel cushions.
"Never opened either package. Bait and switch - the colors sent (3 white, dark purple, dark gray!) weren't even in any choices, pictures. Wrong colors sent - twice. Tried to send back again and was only offered refund. The dark colors will show under while school polo top (uniform). And I learned you get one shot at a fix, too! I was going to pick the Fruit of the Loom all white camis that you can wear front or backwards, so I guess I'm heading there right now to purchase. After I print out 2 return labels..."
This is a very cheap looking product. I returned it. Would not recommend.
Cute but run small. Had to return and now they don't have a size 9.
The clear part up top is very scratchy and my daughter stopped wearing it because of it.  Definitely would NOT be a comfortable choice to wear on a day to visit Disney if that's what you were intending it for.  It also runs vary small.  My daughter got this at age 4 and wore a 4.. it said it was for size 4-6 but she had physically outgrown it before she got into size 5 because of the sleeves being constricting.  I would not recommend this purchase.  I give it 2 stars only because of the excitement my daughter had when she first got it.
"This is a sweet smelling pomade the consistency of cold cream. The fragrance is fine but the product makes my hair dirty looking, even when applying a little bit. It tames down the frizz but with a hair gelled wet and stiff look.

I recently tried their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ORIBE-Body-Wash/dp/B01KPUWJDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ORIBE Body Wash</a>&nbsp;which is absolutely amazing and expected the same of this product but am disappointed. I have short, fine wavy hair that frizzes terribly in the rain. Unfortunately, this is not the product for me."
This is OK
The style wasn't as I anticipated. It really just looks like a grey shirt with black sleeves as opposed to seeing the print.
"The glass eyes are missing on the full t-rex (in picture) and of course do not light up. Would have sent
them back but he loved them anyway."
"The right shoes 'fell apart' the second time I wore them.  That is to say, one shoe seemed to stretch out of size around the top and flop off the foot.  Junk; threw them away."
"im only giving a two because the elastic was way to thight, well made good quality but tight on the waist"
"After putting on this so-called 100% cotton shirt, I found the cuffs and collar produced a strange itch. Immediately took it off and examined the shirt more closely. I was very disappointed to find that there was lycra in the 2 shirt cuffs and also in the collar area. There was at least 10% to 15% lycra. So this is not a 100% cotton shirt. I had originally chosen this shirt because it claimed to be 100% cotton. This is because I have a skin condition that requires only 100% cotton. So for those who need only 100% cotton, you might want to choose a different shirt."
"For a 5'9 person, this dress is way too short. I will be canceling a second order I placed on a similar Homeyvee dress."
Not what i had expected. Cheap demin jeans
"The hat while it is very pretty is not very functional. My hat came packaged in a nice sized box, but it also was folded. The creases run deep and there are three large noticeable creases on the left, right and back of the hat. The hat is bendable and holds shape and fits nice, but the hat is so huge and creased that it can not be worn properly. I can't seem to get any of the long dented creases out of it either. The hat only looks good from the back, but the creases are way too big and noticeable to be able to wear the hat proudly. And it's way too big and floppy in the front that you can barely see."
"Usually have love this company, this is a bad design though. Size 6-9 months won't even fit my 5 month girl. Horribly small"
I have a grey pair of these pants & love them.  The white ones are VERY thin & completly see through.  Not worth the money
It said large but fit like a medium
"Not only do these panties not even come up and cover my belly button, they are like a tight stretchy girdle.  I will go back to my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanity-Fair-Women-s-Perfectly-Yours-Lace-Nouveau-Brief-13001/dp/B00889JGXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanity Fair Women's Perfectly Yours Lace Nouveau Brief #13001</a>&nbsp;of which I have several pair in black and white and as I have stated previously they feel too big which I like, bloomery, if you will.  I would not recommend tailored seamless brief panties because of the girdle effect and I would have to buy three or four sizes larger than my size 8.  I'm glad I only ordered one pair to try.  Out in the garbage.  Very disappointed that Vanity Fair would make something so ""cheap.""

Update 3-5-13:  I gave these to my best friend who wears a size 5 or 6 panty.  She is delighted with my ""high price"" taste."
The hat thing didn't look Vadersih at all.  Luckily we had a helmet my 3 year-old could wear as his big brothers have plenty of Vader experience.
"These plugs are NOT True to size. I ordered a 6g, and the ones that came have an end as large as a 2g. To wear them, I would have to size up to a 4g to see if I can squeeze them into my lobe. I am not pleased."
"I ordered my regular size, however these are way too small."
"Boots have distinctive ""clown shoes"" look to them. Look at those buyers pictures and judge for yourself. The toe area is too bulbous and the fit is super sloppy after they are broken in. The waxy laces are soft and easy to snap off.. out of the box, they are not even long enough to tighten all the eyelets
 (Kidding me!) I bought a pair, tried hard to love them but ended up ebay them.. Then I bought 2 pairs of Iron Ranger charcoal and copper, and now I am working on the next pair muleskin. Iron Ranger fits much better out of the box and as they are aging, they look even better, suprisingly, double cap toe iron ranger looks much less bulbous than this.... If you are into clown shoes, these are for you.  "
These are unlike any traditional 501s we purchased before and compared to other 501s I have they have different stitch pattern/color.
"Beautiful watch and just what I was looking for for so long, however, the strap broke the first time I wore it. It was slightly too big so I was going to take it to a jeweler anyway for adjustments but kind of a bummer that it broke and now I'm concerned it could break again. Given the price I paid I expected better quality."
No good for so much
based on reviews i ordered my usual size (M) .it goes on but is very poorly fitted.  it bunches up in my underarms and i had a very difficult time getting it over my breasts. cross straps seems to be too short . the lace part does no have any type of liner so between the lace and the sequins i could not wear it for long. the material is adequate but not what i expect for satin especially at this price. maybe i got the wrong size but i think it's not well designed. it is a stunning beautiful piece but it just does wear on me right. maybe i can put it in a frame and hang it on the wall
These are not 3E like they are supposed to be. maybe W but not EW.  Felt way to narrow to wear any length of time.  I am flat footed maybe they're not made for those with out an arch
They are not bad but don't look expensive as all! So just ok
"I understand from the price point that it is meant to be a disposable, but what I didn't realize is that it is made so poorly. The head piece looks nothing like it is shown in the picture. There isn't any definition and curve as it is shown in the photo. I just wish they had shown realistic photo of the product."
"These socks are garbage.  Put them in the wash and dryer and they shrank by almost half.  They came out looking like infant socks.  Also, the gel inside heel melted in the dryer."
Great size for over night bag but no good for day to day shopping ect
Had to return. The zipper broke.
I returned them due to fit issues.  I prefer Brooks Glycerin - Best Sneaker I've ever owned.
The pants are really thin and see through. Not worth the money.
This crook is okay for what I paid. It's required to be assembled and over time reassembling and tearing it down no doubt will require duck tape to keep it together.
The purse is cute but cheaply made!  One of the big rippers don't rip up right and material is cheap.
"As a rule I don't wear very fitted clothes.  But having lost weight, I believe I will."
"The vertical seams on the cups in the middle are SUPER OBVIOUS, and the lace on the top shows as well. Not a good choice for a T-shirt top. Fit wise I don't even know where to begin but it certainly wasn't designed with me in mind!"
"This is a Christmas gift. I'm pretty sure that it's too big for the size ordered . Will it shrink in the wash? Also, the applique is not embroidered...it is made from felt. So it isn't likely to survive washing, even though it says washable. I would like to have this info before I return it to exchange. Thanks."
Cheap quality material that stretches when you put it on. Very unflattering. My only positive is the length was good for a short person.
"I had worn out my pair of Columbia hiking shoes and decided to save a few bucks this time around by buying the Nevados. BIG mistake. They're a good looking shoe and would probably work fine for ""looking"" like an outdoorsy genre. I actually hike daily and the 3rd day of wearing these shoes, one of the shoe laces came apart. My heel doesnt seem to sit low enough into the shoe, making stability awkward. The center of the shoe doesnt fit tight enough around my foot , which is probably why the lace came apart when I attempted to make it tighter. I inquired about returning the shoes but was told I needed the original box it came in. I had already thrown away. If you're just going to use for walking flat trails, they will be just fine, im sure. But Im definitly going to spend the extra $25 on the Columbias and have a functional shoe."
Zipper broke almost immediately-this wallet is now in the garbage :(
The chain came right of my hand in a couple days of wearing it!  :( this is a christmas present i didn't get it till Dec 25th and worn it when i get to work on Jan 2nd then it just came right off on Jan 4th!!!
Bad quality of water shoes. Wore them once and they ripped at the bottom. I had to throw them away after that once only.
I was satisfied by the overall fit of the dress and felt comfortable with the fit on top as a curvy woman. The waist seems were too poorly manufactured though and the flare of the skirt is very junior looking. I had to return.
Way too small and not true to size chart
"I ALWAYS wear a size 10.  Bought these shoes and they seemed to stretch out easily.  I'm not able to wear them very long because they feel as though they will fall off.  Also, if they get wet they are VERY slippery.  Would not buy again."
"they look ok, but I ended up choosing a different shoes for my wedding. I didn't like how they looked with my dress."

3. Questionable quality and authenticity.
4. Overpriced."
"I never got the opportunity to wear this because it came after Halloween.  I was not told it was coming after Halloween until my order was finished.  Had I been told that before the order was completed, I would not have ordered it."
"I ordered a 12 4E and it fit like a 10 1/2 D.  It was so small that I first thought the shoes were mislabeled but then I went back and read a few other reviews from reviewers reporting the same sizing problems.  Too bad - its a good looking well made shoe, hopefully New Balance will get this manufacturing problem sorted out."
"the only good part about this is that it has a lot of pockets but besides that this thing is wack.  very flimsy, now I'm looking for another one."
Good quality socks but they make my feet sweat like crazy!
"This camisole was a very nice material but overly FIRM control.  So much that when I got it on, it would roll up right away, then I literally could not get it off!  I ended up cutting it off.  What a waste of money and strength!  It would be very nice for someone MUCH smaller who didn't want so much control.  Sadly it wasn't at all forgiving. I imagine that it would be very and comfortable for smoothing for someone in the ""large"" category, much smaller than a 2X."
"I ordered the small and it wasn't right so I tried the medium this time and it was worse!! I am 5'5"", 130-135 lbs, average build, B cup. Total fail.
This top is clearly meant for someone with a large bust. I really tried to make it work. But it's clearly not right for me. I do, however, recommend it if you have a large chest. It is slightly see-through though."
Nice but I thought a set of underwear was what I ordered u
The box is very large and heavy
It arrived on time I sent to my son he said quality of wallet ok it felt like plastic but he will use it knowing it wouldn't last long
small side
you get what you pay for. was to big and constantly bends
"I bought these shoes for my baby daughter for a wedding. I thought they would be small enough for her to wear. They came and they would probably fit a 1 year old, not a 4 month old.(I choose size 3-6 months) they are not a good material. The foamy unstable shoe makes it seem cheap. Worth it for the money"
"I'm 5'10 and ordered the large, and it's way too short for my torso. I just ordered an XL and XXL... hoping those are better!"
"what was sent to me is nowhere as close to long as it is in the picture.  What was sent to me was 10"" long.  I'm 5'2"", this product will NO WAY go from under my bust to below my waist."
"This is a great, well-constructed bra, but it doesn't fit my body type. This bra is shaped for a woman who is FoB (full on bottom), which I am not. In every way, it fits (by Amazon's over-generalized and nearly useless feedback system on sizing) as expected. The Panache Cleo Morgan or Jude both work better for me as an FoT. For lots of enlightening information and a fool-proof method of determining your size, go to the reddit thread ABTF (A Bra that Fits)."
"Very loose fitting for a size small.  ( I am 32DDD) it was over all too large.  The straps are very loose and could not make any tighter due to the back lace racerback design. The padding in the cup area is not up to par, I feel like the padding doesn't wrap around my bust and instead just covers the front of my bust and the padding doesn't blend into the bralette and I feel that it would be noticeable. The lace racerback detail was nice.  I returned this bralette and did not reorder in a smaller size because of the quality of the padding, and also I don't think the material would be supportive enough for my bust."
"Front has the image, back is completely white.  So when they are being worn, there is a white strip on the side and back of your legs.  Odd!  Why didn't they just sublimate both sides of this sock?  I would gladly pay a few extra dollars for double sided."
I didn't realize that the lid will not stay up because it is just held there with a ribbon! This doesn't work for me! How can you put things in or out when your fighting the lid all the time?
"Shoe fit as expected but I was very disappointed with amazon when I took a close look at the shoe and realize that they actually
Sent me a shoe that was ALREADY WORN. The shoe had dirt in the crease on the bottom, the heel had a tip on it that was twisted and bottom of shoe was so dirty . The strap at the buckle was also torn and something resembling cats hair was in the shoe so I had to return this shoe. I have purchased lots of shoes on Amazon and they were very good but this purchase really made me so ANGRY.
I hope they will send me the NEW shoe that I bought."
Fit between waist and crotch is weird... Almost like it puffs out.
Bought a men's XL and it was more like a women's XL but still a little small for my wife.
"Would not buy again. It's a cheap, plastic quality but not what I was hoping for. I would advise buying a different one depending on the use."
demasiado delgado su material.
"In my experience, New Balance frequently makes small changes in products with respect to sizing, even within the same model series. It is annoying. I also will not order shoes from Amazon again because the window for returns is not that good in comparision to some other online companies. I love Amazon for most things, but there are other, and better, ONLINE companies that have better retun policies for shoes."
The sweater was thin material and the cowel neck just didn't lay properly.  fit as expected but returned due to quality
Had to send back. The quality of the leatherette is very cheap looking. It definitely looks like plastic. I was really disappointed and had to pay a good sum to send them back. Not at all happy..Look like a cheap discount store boot...
Too large & bit into top of foot when walking. Uncomfortable
"I wear 7M, I ordered 7W. My big toe was pressed into the end of each boot. They were not wide enough and I was wearing thin socks. I was very disappointed."
Fit too large and color was very off...
I wish I could give a zero to this product! This is not worth it for the price. I even ordered a size bigger and it was still small. Also this is VERY see through.
hated these as well.
Low quality. Don't waste your money buying this dress. It's waaaaay different from the picture. Too thin & it's just ugly! And it's not even cotton! So disappointed!
"I hate them all and am in the process of returning them to Jockey! However, I am having an issue with printing the ""return label"" and hope to get it resolved this week!"
The memory foam insert doesn't hold up very long.  I've only had mine for a few months and they are already starting to compress into the interior of the sole of the shoe
"I suppose I should have figured this when I ordered it, but the little sides that bend up on either side of the credit card are NOT comfortable in your pocket."
"I usually wear size small and ordered medium because I wanted a slightly bigger Hoodie, but this was too small. But it is really warm."
"It is a thick sweater, but not very flattering in the least. I had to wash it, because wearing it not washed I was sneezing the whole time! It has like bat wings,  not a good fit."
"I was not a fan of this tank and returned it. The fabric is really thin, and the way the fabric is sewn in the bra area is does not lay right. I like to wear these tanks under cardigans, and there is no way I could have done that with this one because of the see through stomach and bunched up chest area!"
This corset looks a little cheap.
"The size isn't as expected, too tight and ordinary finish."
"I weigh 242 lbs. and an XL was way too big even with the draw sting tied properly.  I like the open legs, the pockets are great, but I don't know how much I will be wearing them.  Oh, yes, I washed them in hot water and dried them on high heat.  The good news?  They don't shrink!"
"I did not buy these on Amazon, but I wanted to warn others. My son wore these for about a month before the stitching starting coming out of the top of the shoe and the closure velcro elastic started ripping on both shoes. Very poorly made. I know my son beats on his shoes, but I've purchased other shoes that don't wear down quite this fast. The nice thing about them is that they are lightweight, but not impressed with quality."
Broke the same day I put it on.
"Cheap watch but not price wise . Does not keep good time unless you leave on the desk, then it's good."
"I liked the colors, but did not look good in my size. When I ordered my size and tried it on, it was too large. This sneaker runs big so if you are a size 10 order a 9."
"Smaller than what is advertized, and cut is the oddest ""Slim-Tapered"" cut I have ever worn. Color scheme is way off too."
"Good in theory, but once worn toes peak out and cannot be covered. Also, have a high arch and after a while it becomes painful on arches"
"very heavy, too hot to wear!  Rash Guards should be lightweight and dry quickly, these are just t-shirts with spf."
"The material on these is very thin, unlike the usual 3-pack CK tees I buy. You could not wear these alone as a t-shirt, too see-through...maybe appropriate for an undershirt. And there is a small CK logo at the bottom right so... not the everyday shirts I was expecting. Had to return."
RETURNED SAME DAY THEY ARRIVED!  NOT COMFORTABLE BUT GREAT COLORS!
Sheds like crazy!
I wore thick socks with this but my feet were still cold in 40f weather
"I had high hopes for this slide since I own other Fit Flops and wanted something different. I found it a bit short an tight for my taste and didn't like how it looked on me, so I returned it."
It is ok. Quality as expected. But sizing is weird. Received too big. Then washed and torso was a good fit. But sleeves are bulky and too loose for my preference. Also the blend is not as stated in the customer questions section: the one I got is 90/10 cotton poly blend. Way too much cotton for a shirt that's supposed to be for athletic wear.
Zipper broke a month later
"These are very poor quality. I bought these to replace my 10 year old son's other under armour shoes which were getting too small but still looked good. After wearing these for a week, they look like they have been worn for months!! The fabric is fraying around all the shoe laces, making them look ragged and dirty. I would expect this if I were buying a cheap brand, but am so disappointed. What a waste spending a decebt amount for a ten year old boys shoes and having them look terrible already. Very unsatisfied with this purchase."
"The two starts are just entirely because of the fit. It definitely runs very small. I ordered the 34DDD and it is way too small. Feel more like a D cup.
Otherwise, the bra is wel made and the quality is pretty good. I like all the extra straps and snap closures- they are a nice touch."
"These look very nice, but the posts are too long.  In 25 years of having pierced ears and countless stud earrings, I have never had this problem before.  When I put them on, it is an effort to place the backing in the right spot on the post; too far back the earring droops down in the front; too far forward it looks like the earring is squeezing my earlobe. The notch on the post is worthless: that is usually where the backing rests, but it is too far back on these posts and it doesn't stop the backing from coming off if the earring catches on something (that has happened to me). I can't leave these in when I go to sleep because the back of the post pokes into my head and is beyond uncomfortable.  If it weren't for the extra long posts, I would have given these 5 stars because they really are lovely and I like them.  I just have to figure out if there is some way I can fix the posts without paying a jeweler."
Made to small. Practically impossible to return save yourself the trouble.
"I ordered a size 8 because I'm usually a 7 1/2 or an 8 shoe. Well, that was a mistake. It was extremely large. I returned it with no problem from the seller."
Shoe is bulky and front ripped open after a month light use.
"I'm very frustrated because I just bought a pair of Ones, and after running 16 heavenly miles in those shoes decided to buy the equivalent shoe for trail running (this one - the Superior).  I bought my same size based on the website which says they run true to size.  What a disappointment when I tried them on to find they are at least a half-size smaller than my Ones!  They rub against my longest toes so I could never use them for trail running - I'd be constantly bruising (and losing) my toenails.  It seems my only option is a return, but now the price has gone up $20 if I want to buy them in my proper size!  A $20 price size in two days, and no option for an exchange!  I'm so disappointed."
Great shoes but geared towards older women. Just okay.
"Good fit for my big 7 year old boy but the mask ripped before he even went out Halloween night! Terrible, terrible quality for the mask but the rest of the costume worked out fine, especially during a cold October. He wore black gloves, black thermal shirt, black sweatpants, and black shoes and looked great."
"I'm 52 yrs old, slender with broad shoulders, 32DD chest at 122 lbs/5'5. This bra didn't give any support for me."
Cheap material. I'll leave it at work as a back up. Ordered a french cuff and it wasn't
After a couple of washes they get lint and the threading starts to come out.
Very poor quality materials not as shown
NOT WHAT IS PICTURED.  I wanted the Mario thingies with the metal clips. What arrived are the characters on these silicone bungee things that don't hang nicely.
Suspenders and bow tie fell apart by the end of my prom night. I wanted to look good all night :(
Ordered a 7.5 and they were way too small- could barely get my foot in.
"I bought two of these for an upcoming trip to South America. The size is a perfect balance of portability and capacity. I really like the interior pocket layout and the location of the interior zippered compartment. I also like the low-key dark blue color. Many other wallets come in fairly hideous ""attention-starving tourist"" colors/patterns.

I'm extremely disappointed that I will be unable to use either one for my trip. The first one had the plastic screen material blow out along a seam the first time I slid my passport in (the pocket where the ""British Airways"" ticket jacket is in the product photos). The other had the screen fail at the seam in the upper-left side. It appears that the thin plastic screen material does not take well to being sewed and then frays with the least bit of inside pressure. There is just no way this would hold up to even a light trip. Its a non-starter. What a shame."
"This was a cute little t-shirt dress, but it was very light weight fabric and was small for the size.  I usually wear medium and large clothing and this was very tight.  I returned it."
I ordered the widest width and the shoes still were too narrow. Not made for women with wide feet.
"They were really cute. I purchased a size 8 and I gave them to a friend who wears a size 6. They fit her perfectly.
It was bitter sweet. I was disappointed but she was happy."
"I purchased blue shorts like this from a different seller and they are much better quality, these are not the same, they feel cheap."
"Seem like good quality, but too short (I ordered a size 7, I'm 5'10, 135 lbs). They also did not flatter my butt - actually they seemed to flattEN it."
"Runs small and material very thin, especially for white pants."
It's weird but in an adventurous way. It's like Twister for your junk. It's super cheap... that's why it's not 1 star.
"The dress is made of a horrible shiny material that makes you change your mind and send it back. It is a good idea very badly executed. The front zipper is exagerated and looks bad. I am slender 5'9"" and 140 and even like that the zipper will not look good. The red panel is made of a shiny material, it looks weird. It is going back, back, back."
"This was a gift for my niece, The quality was poor and it was one of two that I bought, and it came hanging half-way out of the bagl  I would like to not that this one was NOT delivered by Amazon."
The separators are not tightly fitted so not ideal for organizing kid's hair clips (what I purchased it for). Also the plastic is flimsy and the top (where it locks) keeps coming off so I have to keep pressing it back into place. Disappointed.
"I am athletic slim build and got medium. They are so tight and thin material that despite putting them on carefully they ripped in three places before I even finished putting them on for the first time. Pattern is adorable, material is cheap and not all all durable for being pants you should be able to workout in, very disappointing"
"These flats were way smaller than I thought. The reviews said to go half a size up and you should go at least a size and a half up! The color is nice, but they were so small I can't even tell you if they're comfortable or not."
"Bag is pretty.  Good size for what I need.  Not happy about unpacking it and sticking my hand in front pocket and my hand going right through the lining as it isn't sewn together.  It looks like it was sewn, but the stitching came undone. No quality control-it is not $2.00 bag, and in my mind that is unacceptable.  Anything that is put in that pocket will fall through it. I thought I was buying good quality....but I guess not."
The product smelled and was damaged.  Very disappointed.
"Bought this for my wife.....
Apparently the mannequin used in the photos in tiny, because it does not fit at all. Also, the ""beret"" is very thin. Not for winter use, unless you like cold air getting through. My wife couldn't get it over her head, and she isn't a big woman. Not pleased."
need skinny legs very skinny legs disappointed
I loved this watch for 2 months and after two months two of the stones fell out! It is very water resistant and fashionable.  I'm so sad it's broken!
"soft, looks nice, good fabric and nice thick waistband, but too small on my 5'5"", 180lb frame. they were too tight on my butt and thighs, which was uncomfortable and was see through once pulled on. says it fits up to size 12, I'm 10/11 and it didn't fit"
"Very wide,dont fit good,but decided to keep,will use as spare"
"Poor quality. I returned it. It arrived with water damage or something ... the colors ran on the inside and it was dirty under the plastic for license..  Additionally, when you put cards into the slots, it makes the wallet become very thick and it looks odd."
"I bought these for a photo shoot to add a cute vintage touch and they looked awful on me. If you have a small or narrow head I'm sure these will be great. Otherwise, steer clear."
"I have to say that we are quite disappointed with this purchase. We bought one as a gift and it had to be returned since it didn't correctly keep time. We then bought a second one which had the same problem. We bought a new battery thinking that might be the problem. We were happy for 2 weeks when the poor time keeping showed up again. I plan to bring it to the repair shop to see if it could be adjusted, but if it can't we will be returning this one too. My husband likes that is thin but we're very disappointed. I can't say that I would recommend it."
"The suitcase is pretty, wheels spin well, but the pull-up handle is loose and clicks to slid down far too easily.  Very touchy release button, makes moving the case by the handle very difficult.  This defeats the purpose of the pull-up handle.  I will not buy another.  Wish there had been a review such as this before I purchased this model."
"Too tight, like it was made for a child, not an adult."
"I asked for a size 6 (Euro 36, 9inches)
When I got it the box said 6.5 over the number 10
The shoe it self said 10 and what do you know , the shoe doesn't fit"
"I love pattyboutik. I have a few tops from her and I love them all. However, this one I dislike a lot. Unlike all the other pattyboutik shirts I have, this one is really short and the cut is off. It covers my entire chest as if I'm wearing a crew cut tshirt, it's very strange. Quality is excellent otherwise."
its wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy smaller n i am a 165lbs n it is short tooo so i didn't like it one bit
It was not that good.
broke the first 10 minutes of wearing it
"Maybe because I'm not from the U.S. or because I'm tall but not a skinny girl but I have ordered 2 Levi's pants and they're huge! I'm 5,8"" and I weight 143 pounds and in Venezuela i'm normally a size 10 (28 in mexican sizes) but I just can't find mi size on these pants. I'm so sad because they are beautiful but I can't wear them like that (I ordered a size 8), I look sick."
NO support for the 'girls' despite ordering my usual size...band fit properly..cup did not AT ALL. returned for that reason
"This is one of the worst things I have ever purchased. I am only 5' 2""--and this thing is so short that the scratchy straps were painfully cutting into my shoulders. Perhaps this is shapewear for 12 year olds? UGH. I wore this for about 2 minutes and was so relieved to remove it-- I can't imagine enjoying any event when trapped in this ill-fitting and scratchy garment.

The bra lacks any support or padding and forced your chest into strange cone-shapes spaced too far apart. It did gently smooth my stomach rolls, but unfortunately it also was so tight around the hips that it created mega panty line. I am not a plus-sized person, I was just looking for an attractive garment for use with a bridesmaid dress that is not my style.

I kind of got the feeling that this is one of those items made in China and they have the proportions just a bit off. Or maybe I got a knockoff/fake? It did say Bali on the tag.

For the record, I ordered a 36C, my usual bra size."
Color is darker then what the picture shows really wish it was lighter in color.
"Not great, broke after two days."
"These were too bulky and unattractive. I got them in black and they looked like orthopedic rx shoes, not sneakers."
"Size 40 is too small for a 9.25 foot. I should have ordered size 41, I guess, which is for size 10 foot. Didn't return them because didn't want to pay for shipping, so pretty disappoitned."
"the hood is terrible, I got this for my 5yo and the hood doesn't even cover his ears and the hair on top of his head is exposed!  Also on the hood is supposed to have those spikes but they are made with thin material so they just flop over to the side, they don't stick up.  The jump suit fit fine, I got the small and he is 42"".  Oh, and the gloves are a joke, they are just white gloves and do not look like they do on the package.  He loves Sonic so I will keep it but I will look elsewhere for a hood or mask."
"It is not uncomfortable, but the cup are cut weird. There is more room for the top for you boob even though the bottom half fits normal."
The stitching came out of one of the hemmed legs the first wash. Only one leg on one pair of shorts. I trimmed off what came loose but the rest came out as I wore them.
"These shoes look nice style wise, but not really very comfortable especially on the front side. Toes felt like they were squished into a corner. Color is beautiful, which is what I was looking for to wear at work or outside. But cannot use them for more than hour, couple tops. I bought them in 6 and was considering to exchange for 6.5's but the discomfort on the front-side of the shoes (very thin not much cushioning) made me change my mind. In addition, the packaging was banged-up/damaged when I received, which was not too much of a deal since shoes were intact. They also have this really strong chemical smell to them. Returning them in the ""same packaging"" and off to more searching for brown shoes for work... Suggestions welcome."
I have worn and washed these socks several times and each time the fit becomes worse and walking anywhere with these socks eith any kind of shoe I tried they won't stay in place.
"Not thrilled with these slippers.  Too large, too narrow,  and no support in the slipper.  I guess I got what I paid for.  Perils of shopping online.  Thank you"
"Once again, lack of info. on where it is made, netted an undesired results. IF I KNEW IT WAS MADE IN INDIA, I WOULD HAVE ORDERED A SIZE LARGER. THE BLOODY THING SHRANK TO DEATH AFTER WASHING. I WILL NEVER  BUY IT AGAIN."
The colors are GREAT!!!  The material is GROSS!!!!  Even tho there is no collar...the material kept finding it's way around my neck!!!  I gave it away!!!!
Purchased these twice the first time they were more sturdy. Second time they were cheaply made and the pin broke after wearing twice
Not HAPPY!!
Not much for the money.
"This is a very cute top but I ordered the XL and thought it would fit....  VERY, VERY small...  more like an XS... no way to return...  will not order this type of item again..."
"Let it me known I did not buy this for my child. Rather I helped a little girl fix hers while she was sobbing.  Yes, it's a cheap costume but after a day of wear by an 8-year-old (with the equivalent activity of walking or running at Halloween), it should not rip to the point she is going to cry. We were at a convention and since I'd seen them earlier in the day and mentioned I made my own Ahsoka Tano costume he rushed to me for help. This began the next hour of this poor girl with me sitting down trying not to sweat off my makeup and whipstitching everything back together. Then I proceeded to take her to a family restroom and redo her face paint since she cried hers off.
All in all, if you buy this for a child... don't expect much. I've witnessed the turmoil first hand that could happen as things go wrong."
"Very poorly made item.  When it arrived the cloth covering the separators in the box was separated, which revealed the low quality materials used to make this box.  This is a very inexpensively made product.  Spend a little more and buy a high quality watch case."
Poor quality. The watch would not stay together and my eight-year-old son has not even worn it for two days after his birthday
I'll be returning this item soon
"Cut was not as shown. Thanks instead there is an unflattering high waisted seam. It's not quite an empire waist. If I weren't so busy, I would return it."
pouch is very small
"Oh boy! Walking on these are extremely painful... They look very nice, but where the plastic finishes and the fur begins there is a piece that makes pressure on your feed"
Color is great but it shrunk and now is too short.
Wow! Wore them and button broke off and they frayed. All I did was drive and go to a store . What a horrible purchase!!! I would give it no stars if I could.
"I bought 2 pairs  in same size at same time. But, one is too big and another one is kind like a bit small. I can't be sure which is correct now?????/"
Low quality. Threads for the case opener are cross-threaded making it very difficult to screw in the pins
The lines on the material don't match at the side seams like it is suppose to. I won't wear it outside the house. It looks thrown together.
"Yep, way too small. The 9-10 size fits my 7 year old daughter. The quality seems appropriate for such an inexpensive slipper."
stains and is too small
"Way too big.  Size small has a bust size of 42"".  That's larger than the standard XL shirt!  It was a comically large tent on me, showing my entire bra both front and back.  The material was surprisingly good quality for the price: a layered chiffon-like fabric that would be perfect for summer if the shirt were wearable.  I requested a return: the seller to return: they offered me a 40% discount or I can pay return shipping to China.  This violates Amazon's default third-party return policy, which requires a return address in the US, or the seller must pay international return shipping.  Not worth the hassle and very disappointing."
The opening of the pockets is to small for my hands
Got this for a Mom size Large and gave it to my son's girlfriend and it barely fits her.... 5ft and 100 pounds.  Cheaply made too
Cheap horrible sweaty nylon. They looked great but the fabric is not for California unless you want to melt.
Nice looking shirt but runs too small
On display and product details should strictly say whether it is for ladies or gentlemen. I bought it for a gentleman and it came from a lady. I was very small and I can not use it
"The size I ordered has fit fine with other Levi Jeans. For some reason these jeans, although my normal size, were way too small. I was also disappointed in the overall texture of these Jeans which were not like other Levi's I ordered from amazon. Somehow Levi's have to get there various Jeans into true sizes and similar textures!"
Thin crappy belt
"Was extremely tight. The hooks were so far back  ( in the crotch area) that I couldn't even fasten it. I had to fasten the hooks before putting it on, so I ended up not even wearing it because when wearing it with a dress, I would have had to completely undress just to use the restroom. Also, it smashed my breasts so much I looked completely flat chested. Not happy with product at all."
not happy. same crap pressed together leather I can get at ross for $7. you can see the three layers when you look in the holes and the edge. this belt is $34. the sizing is weird as well. they said a 32 waist should get a 34 belt and that this belt has 7 holes for adjustment. I have a 32 waist but the belt just fits on the first hole leaving 6 behind. I guess in case you lose 50 lbs. I should return but it already looks misshaspen in 1 day. i'll use it for work
Very pretty but unwearable. I agree with a previous review that said one side keeps flipping under. I had to return because of this.
Just a giant sack with arm holes. Very unflattering.
"I bought two of these dresses for my bridesmaids. They were shorter than in the picture, one fit one bridesmaid ok, the second was an XL and my maid of honor couldn't even get it over her shoulders let alone down the rest of her. So I thought I would keep it, I'm a Med. I also couldn't get it over my shoulders let alone on my chest, and there was no stepping into the dress because my hips wouldn't fit. I checked the dress sizes, I ordered a little large so I could take them in if need be, the Large was for a Med. sized lady, and barley fit, the XL was for a large chested lady (my sister) and didn't fit even a med. sized lady (me) I would NOT recommend this dress to anyone!"
The hood on this coat is SO big that it makes me feel claustrophobic.
"Absolutely adorable, but the sizing is way off. If you wear an 8 get at least 1 size larger. Love the style, though. Cannot wear them"
I wanted to love these so badly.  Really wanted to love them.  Seemed I found something a bit dressier that I could wear with my flipper shaped feet.  I am disappointed that these are more like a $20 pair of shoes than a $70 pair of shoes.  They just seem...flimsy.  Most shoes are too small and too tight and don't fit well in the width or the length.  These shoes were too big in both length and width.  I really was prepared to love them.  They didn't let me down easy :(
to small. my baby girl is 6 month. and the dress that i order is 12 month but it look s for newborn baby for 1 month. i am disappointed for this product
These are incredibly thin and do not mold to your head at all. They feel like they slide right off of my head immediately. Do NOT buy.
did not like anything about them
Bad review really sorry for that i am really need my money back to me
The leg holes ia huge huge. Smaller waist. Nothing tight about them but the waist. Crotch area is sewed together very funny snd weird looking
"Broke the 1st time I wore it ! I have tried to return/exchange and I was told time it was too late!!!!! Funny, just bought it! I have spent ALOT of money on Amazon, you would think since I have shown my loyalty....you could show me some loyalty as a good customer, I may one person but I am upset ,have a large family/friend and client base. I also have a big mouth when I gave been mistreared"
Insoles are very uncomfortable. Bumpy texture was like walking on gravel.
I am not really sure what I expected. They were a liiiittle tight for me.  I was searching for granny panties that could pass for sexy.  These do not pass that test.
"I am not happy with this purchase. The name of the product is misleading. These are not compression tights, they are just tights. I wasn't planning to get tights for a fashion statement, I was planning on wearing them for a little extra support and comfort when I'm lifting in the gym. These don't do what they are supposed to. They are comfy, but not compression tights at all!
I just bought the SUB tights, and those are much much better. They can compete with the top dogs (skins, etc)"
"It's a cute belly ring, it just looks really awkward when wearing it. The flower is too big."
"Very, very small.  I am a size 6/8 and I could barely get these up to my navel.  They appear to be a child's size rather than women's.  I ordered a size medium.  I did not return them because I gave them to someone who was a size ""2""."
its cute but don't waiste yur time unless you are going to wear it once
"This watch is looks good, but the problem is that the straps are too narrow for a males' wrist. I wore it and it looked as it I am wearing my wife's watch. I am a normal built person and certainly would not like wearing this watch. I really wish they made this watch more masculine."
"well i loved the bracelet but it was kinda small, and in a week the clasp wouldn't work anymore , and one of the cz stones fell out, so im sending it back, it was a beautiful bracelet with defects."
This jacket was really cute.  I normally wear a small or medium.  I ordered a medium and it was way too small.  Especially in the sleeve length.
Don't like at all! Hard to get things in and out!
Ordered XL received XXL
Was very disappointed when it arrived. I have bought several Alex and And bracelets in the stores and loved them. When this arrived it is very cheap looking. Will not order any more online.
"They aren't lined and although they are waterproof they don't move well. I wore them for a short period of time and my ankle felt like I had a massive cut on them. To top it all off, every time I check the price it goes down. Went from $67 and today - only 5 days later - the are $52. Amazon did credit me but I will be  returning them due to the lack of flexibility of the leather."
"My first pair of isotoner mocs were great- sized properly, comfortable and reasonably priced.  Unfortunately the style I was happy with is no longer available, so I decided to try this one.  I ordered the 2XL instead of XL since the reviews say they run small- the ones I received were the same length as my original isotoners, but fit way too loose, and the string tie is worthless since it runs directly from one eyelet to the other instead of looping around the back, so it wasn't possible to snug them up.  Also one of them had a hard spot that made it even more uncomfortable.  At least I was able to return them for a full refund- thanks, Amazon.

I've given up on Isotoner; I'd rather spend 4X as much and get a quality product."
It is good quality however it is not a woman's shirt! I ordered a large and it for my 8 year old daughter who weighs 90 lbs. yes this is a vey small shirt! Maybe an xs in women's for the large I purchased.
These are extremely cheap in appearance. I would not purchase these again.
"It is too thin, not what I expected."
Not at all like the picture. Arrived in different colors and pattern from the picture shown. Very disappointed and returned.
I bought several pairs and three of them snagged the moment I put them on.  Please note there were no rings on my fingers that could have caused this and I was careful.  I've been wearing hose for 30 years and never did I have such a bad set of hose.  I will not buy these again.  A waste of money.
too baggy. not really ''slim'' fit
"These shirts are not tall as labeled. The shirts are marked X-Large Tall on the shirt itself, but they are at least 1.5 inches shorter than all my other tall undershirts. The material is cheap and very thin, almost see-through. Will not buy again."
"I like to wash clothes before putting them on so I hand washed this. The threat got loose already and I haven't even got to wear it.  I had to put too large because my review choice is not listed, the strap looks long and there is nothing there to adjust it"
Way too heavy.
"Impossible to wear longer than 10 minutes. Just does not ""fit"" at all. Returned"
Too small. Terrible material
"This belt is gorgeous BUT....it broke after wearing just twice!!! The little hooks on the belt broke off and there is no way to fix them. In fact, they broke while I was wearing the belt which was very embarrassing. So if you want it for a one time occasion, you will probably do fine, but if you want a belt to wear more than a couple of times, then make a different choice."
"Very small, so small they fit my younger child and not myself. Have to return as they have a huge ""cheaters"" logo on the side so unless you are a proud cheater, consider when buying"
Ring came missing stones
The measurements are all wrong
"It is low quality and cheap looking. It is not the sheer type of material of similar shirts you will find in the store, I don't know exactly how to describe it, but is is more ""sponge like""  I ordered the ivory, don't know if that matters. For the price, look at something else...."
"Very uncomfortable and narrow at the front , despite the low heel, no cushion, no support"
"Looked ridiculous. It had a sort of sheen to it. It fit *quite* baggily. It honestly looked like some sort of pajama shirt, not the trendy shirts in the photos."
Too big and too heavy..  Very clumsy.
"especially in toe area , don't think I have especially wide feet but I have to lace up very loosely."
This is an okay necklace for the cost.  But the stones are so cheap that they look white.  I will be returning it.  I'd rather save up for a year for a necklace with better quality diamonds.  The chain and horeshoe itself are nice.
Husband said they were a little tight in the wrong places - lol. They were returned.
"The clasp was defective, I sent it back."
"It is not like as it seems in the picture, as workmanship is really bad , and looks very cheap"
"Good price, but smell truly awful.  What in the world are these things made of?!!!"
junk !!!!!!!
"Was very disappointed when I used this display.  The little bars kept falling off every time someone touched the earrings I was displaying.  That was so embarrassing.

Last craft show I used jewelers' glue to keep the bars from falling off.  It worked pretty good but I doubt if that glue is going to hold for long.

I've only used this twice and am already looking for a replacement."
"The item was way too big. I followed the website description and ordered a large (36-28-38, 5'6) and the shirt fit like a dress. It could be a cute tunic if it wasn't so large. The material is nice and soft, but I look like a child in this. The seller wanted tracking on the package, which would have cost me more than the original item to do from where I live, so I settled for a small refund. Maybe I will be able to use this at a maternity shirt one day. Buyer beware."
"Major disappointment -- I am a fan of Asics shoes (Their 33-M 2 may be the best running shoe I have ever used until its price became astronomical) -- but this shoe is like running with shoe boxes on your feet -- I don't know what people are talking about when they describe the supposed super cushioning on this shoe; for me, it was nonexistent. It is a super light shoe with a neutral last for those supinators among us, but that is the best I can say about this shoe."
"These shoes are cute, soft, and fit well. Unfortunately the laces have pulled out on one of them and I am not able to fix them on my own. I hope the company will reach out and replace these shoes since my daughter has been wearing them for less than 3 months."
"I have owned this bag and the smaller version of it at least 7 or 8 times.  I bought the small version to downsize what I carried around everyday to the bare minimum and then switched to this larger version to be able to carry a bit more without weighing myself down.  The multiple pockets, compartments, zippered, mesh for visibility, hidden pockets to discretely carry feminine items and most of all the easily accessible cell phone holder  was and is ideal for me.  I'd carry these bags for years until I wore them out through much wear and tear.  Completely reasonable amount of use for a non-leather bag.  I'd just pop on Amazon and get another one.  Women stopped me on the street to ask about the bag.  I loved it...until last year when the quality changed. I wonder if Travelon was sold or has switched to a cheaper manufacturer.  The nylon used for the bag is stiffer and less pliable than it was, the strap is a little flimsier, the zippers are of lower quality and the magnetic fasteners are cheaper and don't hold as well.  The velcro fastener that holds the cell phone ripped off.  I sewed it back on.  I bought a brown version of the bag earlier this year -- the zipper on the front pocket broke - I actually sewed it back together which held for a while but then became unusable.  No problem.  Ordered a black version.  Received it on Oct. 24.  As of today, Dec. 8, the strap has completely detached from the cell phone holder.  It is literally held on by two threads and I'm in danger of the bag falling of my shoulder.  I just spent hours searching hundreds of bags for a replacement and let me tell you there is no replacement that will be as convenient and affordably priced as this bag.  I finally settled on the Tumi Voyageur Lugano Messenger which is much much more expensive and still not as good as the Travelon.  I am writing this review both as a warning to others and a plea to Travelon, please go back to your other manufacturer.  This bag is one of a kind and its a shame for it to be in the state its in now."
Did not fit as expected... too small...  :(
"This bag is absolutely hideous. It looks cute in the picture, but in real life looks extremely cheap. the opening is too wide and the bag is too shallow. What is the point of a bag you can't keep things in? I can't even fit my arm through the handles and I am NOT a big person.

It's just made terribly, looks terrible, and works terribly. Waste of money!"
"I literally wore these beautiful looking shoes for twenty minutes and had to take them off.  I couldn't believe how painful they were as they were not especially tight or high.  They are adorable, but I can only wear them sitting down.  I totally wanted to dance the night away in these.  No way.  Was so sad that on carpet they seemed fine, but on bare floors - torture... They are still sitting in my closet..."
"Looks great out of the box but, fits way too small. At least two sizes too small."
Not at all what I expected.  Way too small and the material is terrible!  It looks like an 80s style spandex (very shiny). Not like to the picture.
Watch looks nice but leather strap started peeling after only a few months and battery died very fast.  Not satisfied with this purchase
"I didn't get what was pictured. Theyre not very soft and i ordered my normal size and they're a little small. If you want something soft, get fruit of the loom!"
I'm a shower and still didn't fill out the front pouch in this thing. Think I'll have to sew it up a little too make it work. Otherwise it's good for keeping the frank separated from the beans.
This is your typical silicone face primer. However I do not find it fills in lines and pores at all. It just gives your foundation a smooth base to go over. However I have pores and this did nothing for them AT ALL. Didn't really work for me. However if you have oily skin this might be good for you as I noticed it did absorb oil decently.
One pair didn't even have a zipper in them I am so upset not real happy and wouldn't even give 1star but it made me
Ring fits very tight can't really wear it .
he hated them----to tight in the legs----but he's 77 maybe that why???? Old farts don't like change.
"I don't like the zipper, which is hard to use and doesn't really add anything to the shoe.  Get something else!"
Sizing is a problem.  Gave them to my cousin.
"This belt had a cheap look to it  and sure enough after wearing it for the third time the buckle just broke for no reason, therefore I returned it to the seller who did issue a refund."
"I'm surprised so many people love these. For me, these are not comfortable enough to wear all day long. I usually buy reefs and and wear them morning to night without any issues: they were my pregnancy shoes. These flip flops hurt if I try to do that. By night time, my feet ache badly. I wish I hadn't spent the money on these and just bought more of the quilted reefs instead. Two stars for the style, though. I got the nude color and the shiny part above the foot is really cute. Will continue to wear out during the day but switch back once I'm home."
I wore these once and hated them.  I donated then to a nurse who could not afford to buy many scrubs. Very Stiff scratchy material. Med Couture is a much better line.
coarse material.
I am slim and fit and I can't wear this.  Seriously would fit a store mannequin in the children's department.  Freaky/Scary!
"I ordered a medium (my normal size), and was very definitely way too small!  I would suggest ordering up to a large instead."
The band is awkward
Opening is too small for me to get to my wife's peach.
This uniform fit great!! However it wore out quick.  Pants got snags on the thighs after only 2 washes.  Would not purchase these scrubs again
"I'm a fan of NYDJ jeans and have this same Ami style in a 16W in their Sure Stretch fabric and they're big on me. So I purchased these in a 16 thinking they would fit - I'm currently trying to lose several sizes after a surprise, VERY late in life pregnancy (happiest surprise ever and my daughter is perfect but it did a real number on my body! Ha ha!) so I'm wearing a 16 or 18 in most brands now. The NYDJ Ami Super Skinny pair I have in a 16W are the comfiest jeans I've ever owned in my entire life, and super chic looking! These, however, didn't fit me at all. I literally couldn't get them pulled up past my knees! Huh? Even if these are a size too small you'd think I could get them pulled up over my calves. I have zero shame so I'd admit it if I had big calves. I don't. I've got plenty of pairs of too small jeans (pre-pregnancy I'm a size 12) and I can get even the skinniest of those on that far! I'm dealing w/ pregnancy weight gain so it's almost all in my belly w/ some in the hips and backside. Honestly, I'd exchange these for an 18 but I'm too freaked out by the calf issue!
Aside from the crazy fit issue, these look cute. Lovely, durable NYDJ fabric and quality. Since I can't get them on I can't comment on cut or fit, aside from what I've said already.
Bottom line: if you're wearing a ""plus size"" or are curvy, or have muscular calves these might not be a great choice for you. However, the NYDJ Ami Super Skinny style in a plus size (meaning their W size range) in the Sure Stretch fabric are absolutely fantastic!  Best. Jeans. Ever. And DO size down with those. These jeans are cut far differently than those - so if you're thinking that these are sized/cut the same as those, they absolutely AREN'T. Returning these, sadly."
"The material is good but they sent
One size too large."
"The center of the bra sticks out....it fits perfectly, but I can't wear it due to the center sticking out. Don't think I'll order bras online anymore"
"I typically wear a size 8 shoe and whenever available I will get a 1/2 size larger in a sandal, as I did with these. Yet these were still a bit short. And having a narrow foot, the straps were to loose disappointed. But shoe is really CUTE and lightweight. Hope this helps"
Didn't fit correctly. Someone doesn't know how to make clothing for a woman's body. It was so boxy.
"I ordered two shirts in the same size but differing colors, one was too big and the other too small. There is significant variability in sizing."
"These shoes ran large and so hard, who could wear them all day? For the price I expected more. Had to return them."
Too large for my ears- returned
Very difficult to maneuver the strings and did not feel sexy at all. Size 20 didn't fit XXL.
"Item arrived damaged (soles separating from upper on both boots). Quality is definitely not worth the price, especially since they're not full leather. They look nice, but I was sure I wouldn't be happy with a replacement either, so they were returned."
After one wash the collar became totally crinkled AKA bacon neck
"Okay... from the knees up these fit a little loose, below the knees they're tight.  It is possible that my calves are larger than other women my size but these pants are tight in the lower leg - so much that I'm returning the pants.  If you have smaller than average calves then these may be perfect for you.  If they fit me I'd like them, they're cute.  I'm 5'7"" and they fit in length just about like the model in the picture, maybe a little lower/closer to the ankles."
These shots went up to my belly button and past my knee.. Way too long for my taste and would not buy in the future.
"My husband really, really wanted these slippers, so we bought them even though I was concerned about the quality for the price.  I am sorry I was right.  Cheap material, cheap stitching - these won't hold up over time.  What a rip.  It's a shame too - they're mighty comfy."
Good quality but very slim fit.  My '50%' height and weight child couldn't wear them comfortably.
"The upper material is wearing out. More specifically where your foot flexes as you walk. Right at the widest part of the shoe on the inside edge. I bought these from LL Bean and they refunded my money after 4 months. I bought the 689 in grey through Amazon and the same thing is happening. It is almost like how a Baseball Pitcher needs a leather cover on the inside of his spikes to keep the shoe from wearing in this spot. I can't return them now so I just wear them. The inside of the shoe is ok just a fuzzy bulge on the outside that doesn't look pretty. Won't buy this shoe model again, but for me with 8 4E size, New Balance is the brand for me."
Felt cheap.  Very short.  I sent it back.
Thought color would be more camel color. Not so much
ordered two sizes larger and still to small
"On the small side, very thin material. Can't imagine that they would not shrink in the wash. Too bad that I bought two packages. I love Gold Toe so this was an unexpected disappointment."
Awful fabric (felt) & terribly constructed!
Was broke and all tarnished in pack ...
"These shoes are defective.  Near the lowest eyelet, there is excess fabric in the shoe that creates a pressure point.  You can't even trim it all out.  I have gotten two pairs like this.  Don't buy them without trying them on first."
We ordered size M and they were way too big!
All of the elastic on this rolls. I bought it to be cute with backless shirts but it kind d if looks like a hot mess.
"Crappy. Thought I'd grab em for extra shirts cause I like the colors and they're cheap. Only good for jammies. Too loose to wear under anything or as an actual top. Don't waste your money. I tried shrinking em, didn't really do anything. I am 135lbs - 4'6- size 4. Bought the Large."
"I was really excited to receive this sweater coat. The hood is lined with a burberry inspired beige with black and a red striped silky fabric; it fit great. However IT STINKS! It REEKS! It SMELLS HORRID! I've washed it by itself, FIVE TIMES - the last time using LYSOL (famous for cleaning things that stink since like 1901) and it STILL STINKS. Let me try to describe the smell: think toxic chemical. I imagine this is how the inside of a oil refinery smells, on the day after a spill, when alien-suit clad workers with chemical sprayers flush the facility! The fabric is listed as a poly blend, but clearly something went awry. It's from China - not made in China, shipped for a US retailer - the package arrived international mail from the country of China.  I wonder if it will give me cancer if I wear it? Best not to find out, eh?  I highly recommend moving on. This has been a huge waste of time, as well as 5 washing machines loads of water and detergent.  Sorry, Lysol: some stink can't be eradicated."
"I bought this for extreme cold weather skiing, but fabric is very thin, especially around the neck. Havent tried it skiing yet, but expect it will be cold."
"Super disappointed!
Shirt rolls up at bottom"
Sent back..Did not fit as expected..To narrow..Ordered different brand same size and the fit perfect!..Love this style but just were not comfortable!
Lacks real precision and cheaply made.
"Too short, unfortunately as I'm 5'8."
"Way too big for 2-3 month girl, but they did fit on my 3 year old boy. They color are very bright, unfortunately they are not what I am looking for."
I loved it!!  that it's that the material is TOOTHIN from the back.
Shoes were tight and felt cheap.
very small in arms not really a  true  women 2 x size.  not for size 16 women.
"These were such poor quality that I never even game them to my daughter.  I do not recommend, made a mistake thinking I was getting a good deal."
For ppl with small nipples
They are too small and i have several airs of toms and for some reason these are too small
"No backlighting, I can understand if it was readable. The watch is so dark, unlike the pictures that really is just a piece of metal on my wrist. I cant see the numbers, the date or anything without straining. If someone asks you what time is it at night ? Pull out your phone. This watch definitely looks great, but don't bother buying it for any other purpose."
Seemed too small. But I really need them for work and they were already shipped late. Pretty dissatisfied. Oh well.
"Fell apart pretty quickly, but got a couple months with the help of some crazy glue outta them. Made my feet stink. Pew!"
"Update:  after about a dozen wears, the backstrap on one of these sandals completely came apart. It looks like the sewing that connects the elastic to the padding on the backstrap just shredded. Very disappointed, as was my son, who absolutely loves these flip-flops.

Also, in taking a closer look at the ripped backstrap, I realize that these flip-flops smell  horrible. I can't believe the poor quality stitching and smell after so few wears.

My almost-3-year-old son's first flip flops. Loves them. Wants to wear them CONSTANTLY. Seem very comfortable, he can wear them for several hours without any issues."
"I'm a size 24/00 waist, 5'3"" and a 30C - I purchased a small and the top seemed like it was two sizes too large maybe would fit someone a 32-34D+. The bottoms were a perfect size for me (almost on the small side) but I can't imagine the proportions of the top and bottom together working for many customers"
Helmet was way too big.. strap of goggles snapped on 1st use but I could easily sew it back so that was not a problem.. Goggles fit very well on my 3yo.. love the belt that fits all the items but the binoculars does work (cannot see through it at all).. Quality is not really there..
Extremely small! Could not even get on past my legs. I am 5'2 128lbs and US dress size 6-8. Made for a VERY slim figure. Very cute though... Will give to my 3 year old niece to play dress-up with.
Unfortunately I received the gloves today and they came with a large tare in the seem.
"I loved this suit when I got it just in time for my yearly trip to the Ocean. I thought it fit good, until I actually wore it swimming. My breast kept coming out of the cups and the 2nd time I wore it the underwire poked threw the material in 3 different areas. I guess it was made for looks and tanning not swimming! I ended up throwing it away after I saw the wires coming threw!"
"Cheap socks, but all had holes within 2 months."
"All of the numbers fell off
It's a stunning watch but not worth anything now
Invicta is very very very low in responding"
I got this becuase I have the matching pjs set so I was really sad when they did not fit. 8 1/2 is my size.
"The type of fabric coupled with the lack of a lining made this dress awfully unflattering.  Every bump and bulge above the waist was visible.  The higher neckline drew additional unwanted attention to the midsection.  Given the great price, I really wanted to like it, but back it went."
"I have owned at least half a dozen pumas and find these to be the bulkiest of all. I kept because the price was good but only ever wore to work, not for running."
Weird fit.  I recently purchased 3 diff styles of Le Mystere bras and none of them fit well.  The cups are large and bow out and the band runs small.  This brand is not for me.  Simone Perele fits me really well.
Zero support. Shelf too small for large breasted woman. The girls hand over the end and look ridiculous. Can't/Won't wear in public. 32DD
"Unfortunately, the material started peeling after wearing the belt for the first time. This belt is extremely poor quality, which is a shame because it looks decent and was well-priced. I threw it in the trash. Waste of money. Do not buy!"
"Too small, even for me, and I have small hands.  Sized for a child, perhaps.  Quality is ok."
This dress looks great in the description pictures but looks cheap and old in person. I ended up returning it :-/
"This is a cute shirt, but the sizes run really small. Waited along time for it to come....I believe it came from China. I'm thinking that Amazon needs to make it clear as to where the items are coming from. I ended up giving this to a lady at work because I didn't want to go through the return process. I would suggest to everyone....do not buy from China, their sizes are not close to American sizes.  My friend ended up having to give hers away as well, for the same reason."
"The quality is not that good, will not buy again"
Very disappointed in these .... they are much shorter than expected and don't look right.
I purchased a pair of these sneakers - size 9 for my daughter.  They were too small. Returned and order another one size 10.
It had a bad odor
I got a medium and what I got was an M size but boy it fit like an XXL. Good shirt but sizing is tricky.
Poor quality but that's what I expected.
"I bought a size 7 and I normally wear a 6. I buy a size larger in boots so that I can wear thick socks to keep warm. I just fit into these but without socks. They are cute for the price, BUT, the odor of those shoes is disgusting! They are made from a synthetic product that has the strongest petroleum smell imaginable! To add insult to injury, the box comes with a sticker that says the shoes are made with a carcinogenic product and it must be labeled as such in the state of California! You are warned that they should not be eaten or chewed! The shoes have been sitting, outside, on my deck, for 3 days in the hope of diffusing the smell of the product. It really is unbelievable. I truly pity the people who have to produce these shoes. What a dangerous work environment they must have to endure. Amazon should not be selling this kind of product, in my opinion."
"These are NOT the same quality I find in the store.  Material is much thinner and just not the same.  I have other pairs of these I got in the store (Sears or JC Penny) and a side by side comparison makes it obvious that I got an inferior product.  I would NOT recommend these go to the store.  My problem is that I cannot easily find my size in the stores so i thought same product, I can get it on line.  I will keep trying at the store."
"these have terrible quality, and weird elastic band laces that did not work and needed replacement ASAP.  waste of money, going to landfill without use."
I would have liked to have know that the shoes run very large. I have had to reorder twice. Then I had to pay to ship back. A size for is like a 51/2 in women's.
"Unable to find Russell sweatpants in my area or any other winter fleece sweatpants I found these on the net.  Following their size instructions I ordered medium.  I always think it useful to give a potential buyer my weight and measurement as a better guideline when choosing their corrrect size.  (I just wish others would since size is relative to whom and where the garment is manufactured.) My weight is110lbs, my waist is 28"", my hips 37"" ,my inside leg is 28"" but could deal with 30"" leg if that's all they had.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Every part of the pants didn't fit and because they had seam pockets that added to the width.  I already have some older Russells that had small on the label and I hesitated feeling that these might have shrunk over time but I was so wrong and made a ""big"" mistake.  I should have gone with my instinct..  Russells are a wonderful brand and don't shrink (at least the light grey) my older charcoal sweats seems to be a thinner fabric. I didn't return the sweats because it's more trouble than it's worth and they don't reimburse shipping cost.  So I'm still walking the dog wearing my old sweats (that's me, not the dog:) So giving one star is because of trusting the size chart so choose your size wisely and you won't be disappointed."
"To start the company sent me the wrong costume, I had to return it and wait for the right one, again the second time they sent me a similar one but not the one I asked for.  They sent me a costume that has a pump that gives (fake) blood to the chest, instead the one I asked gave blood to the head.  It was too late to return it again.
After that my son wore it and the pump pierced so there was red food coloring everywhere, in his clothes, hands.
I do not recommend to buy costumes from that store.  Sorry."
Falling apart by month 2
"Not very comfortable. I'm use to just sliding my feet in and away I go. These shoes are made in such a way that I had to use a shoe-horn each time. Otherwise, I struggled getting them on. This defeated the purpose of ""slip on and go"".

It the above problem is important to you, stay away from these shoes. If not important, then I would probably give them 3 stars because I still don't find them very comfortable."
"The arch/curve in this shoe is a no-go for those like me; high arches, prone to plantar fasciitis, shorter toe box. The shoe itself was attractive and seemed well made, but I couldn't even get it fully on! I have other Via Spiga shoes, and lots of other heels/boots/booties in my regular rotation but unfortunately, this was a nonstarter."
"I really wanted these shoes but, they were way to wide for me to keep.
I'm a 10B and these were just too big.
I had to send them back."
"I got several pairs of these pants when they were around $3 each.  A great bargain, but only if they fit.  My 6 year old tried on 3 sizes: 6, 6X and 7.  The 6 is a bit short but just about wearable for her, if she's willing to put up with the stiff fabric and wear pants that stop like clam diggers.  The others are way too big at waist.  My 7 year old tried the 7, and it was too wide for her; she hated the stiff fabric.  My 12 year old tried the 12-14 size and the 10-12, and rejected both -- too wide at waist.  I tried the 12-14, and it was also too wide for me (I am 125 pounds, 5.6 tall).  All daughters are average size.  A pity they couldn't get the sizing right on these.  None of them were wearable for us."
The bracelet broke right almost away. I won't recommend buying it.
"I have always had great fits and success with Dansko.  These particular shoes however, something went wrong.  I found that I only wore them 4 times before giving up.  I work in a lab and pretty much stand on my feet all day, that's mainly why I love these shoes.  But with this part I found I could not stand on them all day, especially the lift shoe, my ankle was in pain by the end of the day.  No, I have not injured or nor do I have a bad ankle.  I stopped warring the shoe just in case it was me.  But, each time I tried the same thing would happen.  Know they just set in the closet."
"I wear a size 13 in all dress shoes, but for some reason that's not the case with these.  The toe box is too narrow and squeezes my toes.

Update 3/3/16: I'm dropping these shoes to one star.  After several months of trying to wear them, I give up.  First, as I mentioned originally, the toebox is too narrow.  Second, my heels hurt like hell afger wearing these for a few hours.  I tried some heel cushion inserts to no avail.

I've worn a lot of different slip on loafers over the years, and these are by far the worst I've ever encountered.  Avoid these shoes.  Mine are going in the trash."
Elastic on Sz. 11 isn't any longer than on my Sz. 10s......measured several of the 10s against the 11 and they all came out the same.
"This is the fault of the seller more than the product. I received the watch with a dead battery and the lighter color looks faded near the edge. It does have the plastic protector on the screen, but still appears used. I'll replace the battery and use it regardless because I had it sent by a friend to Costa Rica where I live and returning it would be more expensive than it's worth. But in general I'm disappointed."
"My umbrella refuses to open and will not work. I have owned this umbrella for 1 month, and I have only used it 3x (due to the lack of rain). Very disappointed."
"Disappointed, I thought I was buying a Scully jacket, Oakridge is division of Scully but not the quality of Scully coats that I'm used to.. It is a lesser brand, and the workmanship is lacking"
"I wanted to like these, but they do not stay on!  I ordered a small based on the size chart, they are too small and keep crawling up in the back.  Not a fan."
"Definitely looks and feels like pleather. There are a lot of other budget dress shoes that look more high quality, these do not."

Mrs. Banks, here - I share my husband' Amazon Prime.  I wanted to love this, and hate may be too strong a word, but what arrived is NOTHING like what is pictured - as others commented, it is not loose at the bottom and not as long as pictured.  A huge disappointment."
The chest of this suit was way too big and the seller offers no way to resolve the issue. i went off their measurements and it still didn't fit
"I'm a 12 1/2 E so I buy 13s in Merrells because they tend to be wider than other shoes. These are good looking in tan and have a new buck finish, but even in a 13 are surprisingly narrow and shallow for Merrells. Also, the insoles have little support and cannot be removed or replaced with a better insole. So if you have a shallow instep, narrow feet, and don't need arch support, these are for you."
Sizes run smaller then normal and seller will not takes returns on items purchased as gifts for Christmas after the normal return policy even though there brand new and never have been worn.
"Fit great, looked good, and felt nice.  But way too see-through. Had to return.  They would be fine if you were always wearing them under a skirt but I wanted to wear them to the gym.

A note on sizing: I'm usually a medium in most bottoms but a small in Spanx shapewear.  But based on comments here I ordered a medium for these leggings.  It was a perfect fit, actually tighter than my current leggings which are Athleta mediums.  So they are fairly true to size for leggings, but consider ordering up a size from your Spanx shapewear size."
It was nowhere near the size I ordered. EXTREMELY SMALL.. And made out of poor quality thin material....I don't recommend it for anyone...
Not for larger breasts.... I'm 36D and it was a no go for me
The handle fell apart after just 2 or 3 uses over a period over 2 months.  We have had a drought in CA this without much chance  to use an umbrella. The other umbrellas from this company have given good service.
Too think the second layer is so baggy. not flowing like the picture
"If you want a robe that isn't gonna cover anything but your arms, get this! Seriously its like having a robe shirt. My butt hangs out of the bottom and I'm not a big girl. Never could figure out how to send it back overseas either!"
The stone was pretty and pronged how I like.. The stone itself was too big and the stem was way too long. That made the fiyting awkward. It's always a hit or miss buying body jewelry online. This was a miss.
Leather like stinks
"These shoes look great esthetically however they're VERY uncomfortable. The back of the shoe (the zipper part) is way to high and keeps digging into my ankle. I had to buy long socks to cushion my ankle, it only helped a little. I wish I had returned them before trying them outside. Luckily they were only $25! But, I'll probably never buy from Michael Antonio again!"
"Low quality wood, splinters and decayed spots. Ordering another brand to see if this is the standard. May end up returning them..."
"shaped like a box, thin and itchy"
"I ordered Fruit of the loom because they make panties MADE IN AMERICA. I looked it up on line and that's what it said.
I then looked to find the style I liked and found it ..High cut. But when they arrived they were made in Honduras Mexico."
The shoes were a little bit small and too narrow for them to be 9 1/2 medium it was like  size 9 Nero they look nice but a little small
Broke trying to put it on.
Didn't like the way they fit - felt funny
"One minute it was on, the next one of the links broke.
I wore it for part of.ma day before it broke."
Looks very cheap. The settings are so small it just looks like a stone hanging out in space. Otherwise fits nicely and the screw on back is great. Just wish they looked nicer for the price.
The jeans are a bit to large.  But most lmportant they are NOT really the color l asked for . The one l wanted it was more blueshh and the one l got is more greenish. So. Not satify.
"Don't buy. Dress is missing holes to tie it. I am 5'8 and the dress was so short it didn't even cover my genitals. The front of the dress hit where a bikini line would start. Edit:  Seller also harrasses you to remove negative reviews through email. Review is honest and will not be removed.

I have ordered 2 dresses by this brand and they are cheaply made. I won't by anything again from them."
"Classy but still kinda tough looking.  In my opinion, a bad design.  Tight at the toes and too narrow, then floppy around the ankles."
I ordered a pair of shoes 8.5. The box says 8.5 but the converse says 9.5 and did not fit me at all. Im disappointed with it
"The watch looks cool (to me anyhow), and I know its not an expensive watch but, my $25 Timex watches of the past have always worked great. They may not look the best or like the most expensive, but they always worked great. Until now...I read that these were new in box which is good and I dunno if its just a personal thing but Ive always felt better about buying something new when it comes in its packaging. So, the watch arrived today, in a box, just not, its box lol. If you're gonna send something new in a box, it should probably be the box that its supposed to come in and not one from another product. Not that theres some huge difference in boxes but it negates the entire reason of stating that its a new product in box or with box. See photos.

Now from Kinda bad to worse. Unless Im missing something and all of my other watches were broken, I thought the day should change when the watch hits 12AM or right around there. Not 2:39AM like this one does. The day of the month works correctly and turns over at 12AM, but the week day, nope, 2:39 in the morning. WTH?? Id probably skip this one judging from the other reviews and now that Ive seen it first hand. Its a shame but it seems like Timex has taken a huge nose dive as a company and as a producer of quality watches. Like I said, they aren't the most expensive, but they used to be rock solid watches at an affordable price. Now they seem like cheap knockoffs of themselves."
Nothing like as shown in the picture. I ordered a size 30 and when I tried the pants on they felt like a size 36.
"Made in China?  Common' people, this is supposed to be a classic Pennsylvanian company.  "
I ordered small but I got large instead so I am very disappointed
Tooo small. 2 sizes about
It doesnt quite match the picture. Fabric winkels easily.
The cup size was way too small. I was very disappointed because I've been looking for a sports bra with no underwire and was hoping I had found it!!
They were much to small. They were nice but to small for me. If I could wear them I would have kept them.
"Thin, fits small. I am 5'3 135lb. Definitely too tight and small for me. Guess the price was too good to be true."
Didn't like this at all
"In the display picture a ""curvier"" woman is depicted. I typically range from a size 10 -12 in regular women's clothing, and usually wear a size 12 swimsuit. This swimsuit, however, did me NO favors. I looked like a busted open can of biscuits. Not impressed. The side straps are far too small with no give. Perhaps if the straps were looser or more relaxed this product might be more practical/favorable."
"Nice vest , but was small for a size XL. Had to return."
Could not get on my foot.  Did not feel true to size.
"I ordered a size 13, which I typically am and I was swimming in it.  I returned and ordered a size 12 and I could barely fit my foot in it, way too tight.  There was no cushion anywhere either so unless your foot fits perfectly into the shoe, its either going to wobble while you walk or be too tight to be comfortable.  Its like trying on a football helmet without any padding to conform to your foot.  I tried to love these shoes but nothing about them worked for me."
"I am 5.11, 180 lbs. I wear a large in any type of shirt and I wear white T shirts often. This product is not only too large it  is too long. The actual length is not reflective in the model photos that appear on the Amazon site. The length depicted lies somewhere above what would be the top of the zipper. The actual length is about six inches longer than that. The length is important to me as I wear the T shirts out of my pants as outerwear."
"Very simple, do not recommend."
"Several things I didn't enjoy, very fragrant.  The lotion was very fragrant and also had an odd taste, yes taste, I could taste it even though it was only on my face.  And I do have a husband who also kisses me, he said it was perfumey and kind of a turn off.  The lotion also dried my skin out.  At first I thought, this lotion is new, I'll just give it time. I had already been using the serum for awhile, so I was surprised at how dry my skin got. By day five my skin was red and itchy and very visibly dry.  I gave it a few days off, and tried again, the same thing happened.  This is not a lotion for me.  I have mildly sensitive skin, oily in the T-zone, and dry everywhere else, my skin is neither mature or very young, it's in it's 30s.  I used as directed, with other Vichy products I had already been using.  This lotion was not for me.  Perhaps others will have more luck."
"Very short in length about 4"" too short"
"Look, these are probably great shoes, but I hate the style: Much too western for my taste, and the fancy stitchwork was far, far too busy. The pair I tried out was in my usual shoe size, and felt slightly tight across the ball of my foot. I recommend going up a half-size."
"I'm very disappointed, I got the impression from the photo they were almost round and had more depth to them but they are basically flat buttons and rather then looking celestial they are just sort of flat colors. Would not recommend"
"Besides the waist and wrist cuffs wearing out well before expected, the sweatshirt is quite warm and comfortable. The Arc Flash Rated pullover is much better."
"It last two days after adjusting it to the combo I wanted it feel loose but I didn't mind but after a little wear the black was coming off (friction with other rings I use) and the part that holds/indicates the combo you choose fell and I lost it now is just four numbered rings, I do not recommend"
"If it's the right dress, it's badly made, not really white, and really ugly, and looks nothing like the picture."
Bought these at the Sketchers outlet store and within 3 days the color on the toe wore off. So disappointing!
This was way to big! It is not a ONE SIZE FITS all... If you are a size 2 then this is not for you! It's more for size 8.
Very itchy. Not soft at all
"This had so much potential.  I loved the way the girls looked on top!  (for reference, I am a size 34DD).  I almost kept it just because the bust was so flattering.  But I am heavier in the tummy/love handle area, and the fabric was too light/thin in that area, so it accentuated my rolls and love handles.  I would have loved it if the fabric was firmer in the mid section to hold me in a tiny bit more.  This would be best for flatter tummies or more hourglass/pear/boy figures.  It did not work with my apple shape.  Sadly, I returned it."
"I had high hopes for this to be a good beach dress for the summer. It is super, super lightweight, almost feels like you have nothing on, which is great for hot days. But even in the navy color which I ordered, it's transparent. Sad day. For that reason alone I am returning it. But for me it's not a practical dress anyway. I could wear it over a swimsuit but that's about it. Even with a strapless bra it's so low in the back and underarms that you'd be able to see the bra. A bralette would look cute but I'm a nursing mom so that doesn't really work for me at this time! Oh well!"
"While I like this brand and own several other styles, the toe part was way too tight."
"Three key issues with these pants. First off, these are not beige, but have a bit of copper tint. Second, the waist is most certainly NOT expandable. I can only suck in so much, man! Finally, they were a bit voluminous in the legs for a slim fit.

The pants themselves seem fine, it's just that the description of them is most certainly inaccurate."
"I'm a slim guy, and it still fit me entirely too small, and tight. Looks much better in the photos but in person it's not very attractive at all."
On the beginning super comfortable but after few wearings material stretches a lot.
"I returned it, it didn't look like the photo!"
Color not like the picture. Waiste tooooo big.
"Besides the fact that this was the cutest hat and mitt set EVER - the hat just didn't look good on me. To add insult to injury, the mitts and hat were snagged. I would have just kept the mitts and tossed the hat - but who wants damaged gloves!?

RECOMMENDATIONS: Definitely buy the muks brand gloves. I have never put on gloves so warm in my life!"
"Perhaps I just did't apply it correctly, but it didn't work out for me. It didn't cover (or really support) my breast (I may as well had went braless."
Too big and it wasn't long enough
Package arrived empty!
Not the most comfortable shoe from Crocs. Digs in feet.
Bought this for my husband but it fits like children's size. Wasn't worth the hassle of returning. Thick fabric but way too small.
"Such a beautiful boot love the leather so
Soft. It's made so well. I got a size 8 feels big on top of the foot. but the length of the shoe is short. The worst part for me is trying to get my foot into the boot. This boot needs a full zipper not the three inches or so it has at the ankle. It's such a struggle and I have small ankles with a med. calf. This boot is the worst fitting boot and I have over 10 pairs
Of Fit Flop shoes, boots, and sandals. I will return them."
"Very thin, I read the reviews that said it ran small so I got a bigger size. The 3x does fit but I think they ought to resize their merchandise if it's over two sizes off. For price I was expecting a bit better quality it's so thin I have to wear a tank top under it. It's also a bit short so a tank top helps add length. Hate the seam down the middle, you can't tell its there from the picture. It's very obviously here when you put it on though. It was a weird design choice."
This sweater fits nothing like it does in the picture unless u order it triple your size. its also not a high-low fit like it is in the pic! :( Its a good quality sweater I'm just upset it wasn't what I expected. So that's why I give it a 2 star rating....
"Fit fine, but shrunk after washing."
"I read the other reviews and figured they must be a bunch of fat guys complaining about fit. All I can say is that I am a thin guy. 31 inch waist. These pants are beyond skin tight. My thighs and seat were under severe compression. Length and style were fine. But the fit is terrible. These are like skinny jeans. Not loose. Not baggy. Not relaxed. These are skin tight from the waist to the knees. No room at all in the thighs, seat, or crotch.

Terrible.

At least amazon has an easy free return policy."
Fits my 8 year old daughter the way it should of fit me . Purchased an XXL.. very disappointed  it is like a spandex body suit dress!
RUNS SMALL DEFINITELY ORDER TWO SIZES UP
"This just fit so bizarrely. I suppose if you had a 46DDD bust and no butt, you might do ok, else it just hangs wrong and is too immodest for public wear."
Very small. Had to use an extender.  Other than that like it.
"I normally wear a 6 medium but I had read on line that these ran large. My sister ordered the 5.5 size so I had the luxury of being able to try those on, and to my surprise, the 5.5's were definitely too big for me so I thought the 5's would be perfect. They were perfect width wise but too short in length. Too bad! I think the sizing is off on this line as I normally have no problem  fitting into a 6."
"Really cute, great color, but after I put my phone in it, nothing else would fit due to the odd size."
was cheap looking!
"This shoe is awful. The length of the sole fits my foot, but the straps and everything else are VERY loose, even on the smallest adjustment."
"Ordered 2 red ones, L and M each.  M reached first and I already feel it's a bit smaller than expected, or comparing to other purchasing experience with the brand CK. Later the ""Large"" sized arrived and I felt astonished it is even smaller than the first one.
Just like the other customer claimed, the L is a SMALL in deed !!!
It's inconvenient for me to return, so I have to keep it."
arrived on time but you get what you pay for...these boots run way to small & feel hard all over...they were cheap thats why I bought them but just gave them away.
A bit too snug for me and they arrived with a hole in the leg. Strange shiny material and not very fuzzy on the inside. Disappointed. I returned them.
The knee pads are too small in height and width. The pad falls to the bottom of the pouch. So when you bend down you have to pull up the pant leg to get the pad to be over your knee.
"I love the design and look of the shoe, but unfortunately, the deck is terribly uncomfortable.  The heel is raised, and it is almost like a stair step down to the foot pad.  I have been wearing these all day the past several Saturdays, trying to break them in, but I don't see any improvement.  I need them to be more comfortable like all of my previous Adidas turf shoes, but they are just NOT.  Poor purchase for me, and not cheap..."
"Watch band is cheap but functional.  The steel is easily bent and ""jimmied."". Be super careful with watch tools and installation because you will scratch the links.  Sizing the band is a nightmare  as the links are wrapped style.  Be prepared for a lot of cussing under your breath.  Oh, and by the way, you will scratch the cheaply made links during this process.  The band came floating around the Amazon box loose, out of its broken plastic case"
Picture showed what looked like a normal size pocket watch was very disappointed when I recieved a tiny pocket watch necklace I would not buy this product again and don't reccomend that you should buy it either
"They are comfortable, but quality is very low. Just after a few times using it, the leather in the heel was damaged appearing as a low quality shoes that I am about to give away."
"Four years after getting this, I finally had an opportunity to use it.  On the first gust of wind, the umbrella went inside out and the metal frame things broke.  Now it doesn't open up all the way.  This umbrella looks cheap and flimsy and it is.  It's probably good only for light rain when there's no wind."
"These are a cute print, but I had to send them back because they are pretty see through when you bend over. Might be okay for running, but reveals a lot if you are doing yoga. Fits great though, true to size."
it took 3 washings and dryings to get the chemical smell out of the scarf. it is also shorter than it is described.
"Very, very thin. Panty hose like. Not what I expected; however, with a longer top to cover, it will work."
quality is dissapointing
First time a 13 D(M) US does not fit me.
Piece of junk
"The material used for this outfit is very cheap. My daughter however, loves this outfit which is why I gave it two stars. I think it's ugly."
What a waste of money. Not only are they not sized correctly but the material is very cheap!
Scarf extremely disappointing. Very heavy - arrived twisted(or sewn incorrectly). Had it repaired but still does not hang comfortably.  Look for another  scarf!!
"These are very poorly designed pants. Wrangler puts in 4 cargo pockets instead of two, so each pocket is too small to fit much. I cannot fit my wallet in any of the side pockets. Further, the bottom pockets - the bigger ones - are too far down the leg to reach into easily and sit on the knee when one bends - very uncomfortable if anything is in the pockets. I also don't care for the velcro closures - really loud and sometimes tough to open at all. As a result I rarely wear the pants."
"I wish I could do 3 separate reviews (1st-5 stars and the last two reviews would be 0) for this flip flop, but I can't.  Purchased these shoes for my 3 year old in a size 9 and they were just a little too long...not a big deal.  So, I can't complain about the pair she received.  On the flip side...I ordered these for my 9 year old in a size 6, big kids and she was excited to receive them.  They arrived and it was apparent that they sent the wrong pair.  Instead of a 6M for big kids...what arrived was a 6M for a toddler.  However, they are labeled (toddler/little kid) 6M Big Kid.  After speaking with the rep, a replacement order was created.  So, I was hopeful that the correct size would arrive.  Not so!  Today, another toddler 6M arrived and it too is labeled for 6M, Big Kids."
"Way too big! I got a small and was extremely huge..had to give it away. Fabric was super soft though, i wish it fit me.."
Threw them away. They were ugly.
"I ordered the black patent flats and got black suede flats, not patent. Didnt feel like they were worth the return. They actually fit okay. Just wish I got what I ordered. Bummer."
"I have several pairs of Crocs and love them all. These Sanrahs are cute, and the sole sizing is as expected. The straps were much too roomy though, so my foot flops around in them. I do not  have narrow feet. They're going back, unfortunately."
Too small to fit all of Lucy's keys into. You can only fit...maybe 5 at the most. It's disappointing.
"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! These took over TWO MONTHS to receive! They are very cute, but not worth the wait."
"I don't like it and I don't like the material. I order small, and when I fit it on, it looks like a medium or large on me. Tje jacket looks like cheap, too!"
"This product runs small! I would suggest buying one size larger then you normally wear. The printing on this shirt isn't the best, it seems cheep. I wouldn't recommend this product based on quality and size and cost."
This is a cute belly ring and while it lasted I loved it. But it started falling apart after a few weeks and now all I have is the upper flower part. I do not recommend for leave in. Best if used for one day event then take it out and replace with something more durable.
The socks still show when wearing flats.
"These were uncomfortable for me; just trying them on I could tell they would rub the back of my ankle if I attempted to wear them out. Therefore, I'm returning. I usually love Steve Madden shoes, so kind of surprised this pair didn't work out."
"I am not that happy with this pair of boots, they are much slouchier than they look in the photo. The insole is not comfortable at all, so they are only good for wearing for short periods of time. However they were a reasonable price."
"Shoes felt like they would come off too easily & this mom needs to have a cute shoe, but also a little more secure on the foot than these. Too bad because these are really cute shoes & the price is nice."
"WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY, LOOKS, OR RATING!!!!!!"
"garbage, good thing it's cheap."
"I think you would have to be a model for this dress to wear well. I am 5'4""/150 lbs. and bought my usual size 8. It's frumpy, dumpy and makes me look shorter and fatter than I am. I have a short torso and the waistline was somewhere around my navel. The skirt made me look like a whale.  I usually wear petite sizes best, and this dress swallowed me. The green color is gorgeous, and I really wanted it to work, but there's no way it would flatter my pear-shaped figure."
"It is not waterproof and the seller did not answer the question,"
After five months this backpack started falling apart...I didn't use it that often.
This shoe did not meet the expectation.  It is poorly made; if you have ever had problems with you feet do not buy this product. Clark evidently does not make the quality shoes they use to make.  The pricing is still high and the quality is not there.
Poorly sewn. Coming apart right out of package. Lapels are saggy. Too small to button although shoulders fit properly.
"Husband hates these, say they fall down all day, too bad."
Not sure if mine are any shade of green and don't look any kind of silver or silver plated.  Really small too. Glad I did not pay top price.  I am on my way to wal arts to buy their peridot silver earrings for Xmas party tomorrow for my granddaughter
It was the right size at first but then I washed it and it shriked!
Weak did not last
I returned it...it was too tight in the bust even though I am not very busty at all.
unconfortable..n ran very small
After about 30 minutes they really hurt my feet. I bought a size larger and I should have gone higher.
The stitching was WAY off on the arms and way too noticeable to wear.
"Does not look to good in person, quality wise.  It's also very big."
"I got this and I was very disappointed because it does not look anything like the photo its old and washed out,NOT WORTH THE PRICE DO NOT BUY I WOULD REALLY GIVE THIS A ZERO STAR"
toe boxes are too form fitting for activity shoes.
Material is cheap and see through. I don't know why this is getting such high reviews. It reminds me of the garbage material used for my high school graduation gown. It was super tight on the bottom and the top was loose. The zipper didn't even go down the entire way because there was random stitching stopping it about 3/4 of the way down. Absolute garbage. It's going back.
Disappointing both times
"I gave these boots two stars, not because I didn't LOVE them...but because they are cheaply made. I had these boots all of two weeks and the zipper started to unzip from the bottom up. HOW EMBARRASSING!!  Also...be careful with which boot ""style"" you select. Some of them have the ugly two toned heel and others have the solid black. Made the mistake of getting the two toned as a replacement and it looks HORRIBLE. Sending yet another pair back for replacement of the first pair.  See pics!"
"The heels are too hard and hit in a weird place. Not low enough, not high enough... Also these shoes smell like sweaty feet way worse after only a few days than literally any other shoe I have worn. Gross!"
Fits too large - had to give them away.
"Nope too short, they need to make these longer
And add a pocket, I know Im not the only person with a big belly to cover if its a 7x shirt it should be long to cover your belly"
I was really disapointed flip flop runs a size small.
It's too expensive to send them back. They don't fit due to not being cut and seamed correctly. Poor quality and a waste of $$
I finally received this after ordering a few weeks back. The cross broke off as soon as I took it out of the package. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the chain is actually (seems like) better material. It is layered nicely.
"I would give a full 5 star for quality and comfort, BUT....  they sit to high for my taste and since I do NOT look like the model shown,  it makes the waistband roll over which is really annoying.  So,  in order to wear these and have it sit where I would like it,  I purposely roll the waistband over myself and then they are fine.  But for this price, they should be sitting a little lower.  If you just put them lower then the bottom doesn't hold things the way it's suppose to.

Very disappointed in the ""rise"" part of these and there is no ""low rise"" boxer briefs......  only briefs, which I do not want.  Guess i'm going to a different brand."
"This didn't work at all for me. Awkward fit, impractical to wear."
fit is ok but the fabric is very thin wondering if they will withstand a wash.  Feels very cheap
Such a great idea but it does not work I tried everything.
"had a run in the crotch ,i wear long shirts over them,only wear them  at home..they are comfortable..apparently the men in town noticed .. i wasn't very happy about that.."
"I looked at the reviews before I purchased them. I'm originally 7.5 and from the reviews, you should get a half size larger, which I did. I ordered an 8. It came, tried it on and too still too small. Exchanged it to 9 and now it's too large. So I'm returning it. It is a nice shoe, but the fit is odd."
Didn't stand up well to normal use. Spend more and get something better.
I will be returning this product. I bought it for my husband. The exterior fabric is heavy and doesn't give or flex when wearing it.
I got this for my 8 year old son who's too lazy to keep re-tying his laces. The product frayed from moving the secure lock back and forth. As of now it hasn't worn through but it's a matter of time.
"I thought how could you go wrong with 270 plus positive reviews but shoes are probably the most difficult thing to review because hardly anyone has the same foot or preferences. And they really need to fit well and feel good or they can ruin what should be a good time. Shoes are one thing you shouldn't buy just for the price.

I bought these for hiking but as soon as I put them on I knew I'd be in trouble after a day out in these. While the fit is great (it's very hard to find boots that come wide) there is hardly any cushion inside - anywhere. They just did not feel comfortable. I prefer to wear thin socks so that doesn't make up the lack of comfort. The lining even feels rough. But the worst is the seam that hits right at the ball of my ankle. Scrape, scrape, scrape, that's all I could feel. Imagine several hours of that. I also didn't notice any arch support at all.

Based on other reviews it also seems that the quality is not consistent. I don't think that was the problem with mine, they just don't work with my feet."
Opened it. Four year old tried to put it in her hair. Comb fell off in thirty seconds. Now I can't use it.
"I chose this set because I know that the peach and the middle one marches my skin. I am a light Olive.
The first two are just as pictured but the bottom one was a dark metallic color.
The white one, I will have to give it away and now the darkest one too. I really wish I had the right color as pictured. I like the bottom one the most. Unfortunately it is the one I didn't get.

But thank you so so much for the extra rubber back locks. Love them.

Update: I wear the earring about every other week. Yesterday the stud got pulled off the pearl when I take it off. =("
Fit good for about a week. Poorly made waste of money.
"I ordered the size I always wear in dress shoes/heels, these were so small, I couldn't even fake they fit to wear them for the occasion I purchased them for."
Nice orange color. The band is cheap. Made in China. If you are looking for a nice watch to beat around. This is it. It does rip your hairs off your wrist sometimes. Other than that it's ok.
"I bought these to wear after chemo. They are very long and very thin and quite crinkly,  so hard to wear as a headscarf after chemo. These look like they would be better worn as neck scarves, although they are so thin, they wouldn't be very warm"
I wanted something to wear that would ensure everyone who sees me can instantly figure out what a pretentious hipster I am. Spot on!
"Found these to be rather ordinary knee-hi's.... sheer, prone to runs, worse...roll down to ankle.  They don't stay up at the knee.  Definitely not worth the price.  Go to Walgreens instead!"
"These are beautiful shoes - and at first trying them on seated, I thought ""HOORAY!"" Then I stood up.
The heels are enormously wide to the point that I couldn't walk in them without falling out of them on every step.
A real shame - because otherwise these are beautiful shoes!!"
"These boots were adorable! I loved the dog print. I sized down a full size as recommended in several reviews. They were roomy enough but my foot wanted to slip forward, pressing my toes against the inside of the toe box. Almost as if the footbed was sloped - it felt strange. I did send these back."
Cute but the belt is faded and looks more silver than gold
"Entirely too small.  Ordered a size up from size chart, based on other's reviews.  Still far too small.  Not worth sending back to China - will be more careful in future not to order from there"
"Don't buy.  Although it is very comfortable and inexpensive, I didn't even wear the watch for more than one day and the face got all scratched up.  The bulkier 5600 is a better bet for any one that is not super gentle with their watches."
"The shoes look really nice, but they squeak with every single step.  People were literally laughing at me in the office because they could hear me anytime I got up from my desk.  I have contemplated sending them back because you shouldn't have any complaints with $180.00 shoes.  They are also very stiff and do not have comfortable insoles.  Irish Setter Soft Paws are ten times more comfortable."
"You definitely get what you pay for, its cheap, so it looks cheaply made.  The paint job is horrible, looks like a 5yr old painted it.  The design isn't bad though, if you want to mod it, I'm just going to cut and glue the pieces together, maybe replace the facemask, and repaint it.  But I was pretty surprised comparing the pictures to the actual product i received.  The 'chrome' is just silver paint haphazardly painted on, looks nothing like the pictures.  And its large, very very large, add some padding and its fine though."
These boots were way too big
This was a disappointment.  This duster was cut too small and had an odd shape to it.
"While this does hide my bra strap in a low back top, it also makes my bra not fit correctly.  The cups pull into a awkward position and feel too loose. And the strap around the waist is really uncomfortable.  This will be okay if I really have to wear it; but I find that when choosing between wearing this strap or finding another top to wear, I find another top."
"I wear a 9.5-10, but I got a 9 since it runs big. There's a little room to spare but they aren't too big, a 10 definitely would have been too large. They're a velvet/suede material. I'll update if they fall apart too fast or something but they seem like they'll hold together resonanably for the price. I wouldn't run a marathon in them."
There to wide at the bottom....I washed them hoping they would shrink a little  still  don't like them ....I will take them in I bought another brand and I love them I will stick with them..
The wig hair is much shorter than the picture makes it appear.  The color is the only perk
I was so excited about this shirt and I wanted to love it.  It fits awkward in the bust.  I am not even sure that being really busty would fix this problem.  It is almost like Madonna cones but with less support.  I am a 34 C-D and the top was gaping open.
"Cute bows but I'm so tired of fixing these bows!!! They fall apart after one or two to times of my daughter wearing them!
She doesn't even need to pull on them before the bow detaches from the clip.
Complete waste of money"
My husband could not fit it. The sizing must run small. Not good. I needed this for a cruise.
Ugly and looks nothing like the image. The fit may be ok but didn't even attempt to wear it.
i return it back  secand day . i have to pay for return.
Too small. I ordered the next size (4.5) and they weren't much different but better so I kept them.
"It's much too small, both in waist tension and is much smaller for the pouch."
"This is a nice windbreaker, it simply wasn't worth what I paid. It's very thin and feels like it could even melt in the sun."
Ive only worn these a few times and the elastic is coming out of the pants all over he place. Looks like there are cactus prickers sticking out all over the place. Ive tried removing them without success.
I have many pairs of Onex sandals.  Have been buying them for over 35 yrs.  This pair is very narrow at the toe.  I do not have wide feet so it is unusual that I cannot wear these.  They seem to be cut from a different pattern than most.  On the other hand they are cute and classy looking.
"This is not very durable product, it is almost broken after few months of use by my middle school student kid"
"Exact model # as a previous Just My Size K220 bra I had ordered + loved.
This one however was mis-shaped + uncomfortable.  A real disappointment."
"Cheaply made, not like other suits ordered from this same manufacturer.  I have purchased abot 5 suits from them previously and this one didn't pass muster."
"I am very disconform. The shoes are magnificent. My first pair I bought in November 2017 and it was time to renew them. In August 2017 I bought exactly the same shoes, in the same size 11M. But just today September 7 I was ready to use them .... but the size is totally wrong! It looks like 9.5. When compared to the old pair, it is almost an inch shorter."
"Hand washed and hung to dry, the entire hem came out."
Not bad but ok
A lot bigger than expected and I don't see any lights
"Unfortunately, the clasp broke within a few hours of my daughter wearing the black one. We just tossed it."
"Athough I usually like the 'Cool 18' line, these shorts were disappointingly small with a very weird cut and fit especially in the front."
"Arrived quickly, as shown.  The knot came out of tassel part within a few days.  My daughter was disappointed"
Zipper busted on the boots.
"fits well, but color is wrong for me.  will return it."
"Narrower than expected, shallower toe box than expected.  Seams of shoe rubbed while walking.  Poorly constructed. Returned."
These crocs fit me exactly to a tee.  Which isn't what I wanted I guess.  They were right up on the edge of my heel both on the sides as well as the back edge.  They were also more narrow than I expected (or my feet are too fat!)  I ended up returning them.
"The only reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because this backpack stinks. Literally. The backpack itself is very cute, just like the photo, but it has a strong smell to it that people keep asking whats that smell and Im so embarrassed to say its the backpack.

Update: I lowered my rating to a one because I washed the backpac TWICE! I let it sit in soap and water, and nothing works. The smell of fake leather is so strong it truly smells like A-S-S.

Seriously."
"The straps doe not extend far enough, so it holds your breasts too high and is uncomfortable at least for me, the straps should extend farther and then the bra is fine otherwise.

o"
"returned, glue was immediately coming off the id window"
These are not for use on DD. The very idea is laughable
"It's just to large, folk is also too big. The material is good. The elastic is also loose which will not hold it up."
"Once again someone has made a dress increasing the size of the torso without increasing the armhole or sleeve circumference and called it plus sized dress.  The fabric was very stretchy and thin, not a problem.  Great for layering.  But, I couldn't get my arms in the sleeves.  Very disappointed.  Returned."
Material is gross
"A familiar problem with Clarks...this shoe leans to one side, and does not support your foot/ankle evenly. Twisted my leg the first time I wore them."
Not happy with the cut.
"This is NOT an original band.  Even several items in the picture can be identified as NOT the original as they are advertising.  On the origial Z20, the loop around the buckel end that holds the excess is square.  The original Z20 is rounded on the top and bottom.  And, they are not even advertising the correct band in the picture.  They are showing a 22mm band, when it should be the 20mm."
"For children don't be fooled disappointed, gave to a friends daughter."
Too Small.  I have to lose some weight and take out some bones to fit into this.  Maybe I'll have a tailor attend to it.
wouldn't buy it again. sleeves are too short.
"My hubby wears a size 10.5. shoe and likes low socks and that is all I buy.  I purchased these and he showed me that when he pulled the sock over his foot, it did not stretch enough to cover his heel.  At first I thought maybe I had ordered women's sized socks by mistake but I checked and saw that I did not.  These run way too small for men whose shoe size is above 10.5 despite the description.  If these fit a man's foot, perhaps he wears a size 9 shoe.

These are thick, nicely made socks but if you can't wear them, then they are useless socks."
"so tight , and very used ... no bueno"
Great pants! But not if you ate taller than 61! Hope I can let the hem out after washing.
"Got it for a ""funny"" gift, but it was all out of shape. I don't even know what he did with it.  Never put it on and he's a professional chef."
I love the look of the shoe but they are not designed for someone with a flat foot. I wore these to a football game and couldn't keep them on my feet...heel kept sliding up  as tho my foot was coming out of the shoe-terrible feeling cause Im recovering form quad knee surgery...very shallow designed shoe...I am not pleased with how shallow the heel is...very poor design with no support...would like to return them but I wore them for about 4 hrs. please advise
Doesn't work for ample chests.
"I really wanted to love these! They're so cute and I love low profile and barefoot shoes, but the heels just weren't right. I got terrible blisters and knew that I would keep getting them, so I had to return them. Oh well! I ended up getting the Keen Sierra Mary Janes, which don't rub as badly."
Nice but runs small.  xxl fits more like a medium or...also received the pastel colors not the bold colors  I ordered. I already threw out the packaging otherwise i would return it
Too small.  Very disappointed. Order bigger than what you are by two times.
"I wanted these to work. And if they had, I would have bought 3 more.

First, they say Free Size on the package, leading me believe this is a retailer not familiar with US expressions.
Second, they were way to long. Apparently, plus sized means tall not curvy.
Finally, there was a strong chemical order to these. So strong, in fact, that I am not sure I could have worn them with the order. I didn't bother to see if I could get it out as they didn't fit anyway."
This thing isn't made for adult male heads.
It is super itchy. Will have to retrun it.
"Wow, I don't know where to begin with this comment because I have purchased Levi's shirts on Amazon before and have been so happy. This top is so ugly, the color is horrible, it looks old and dingy.  I am so very disappointed. It is absolutely not worth the price.  The red tag on the color just has R and not LEVI as seen on the shirt.  It truly doesn't look like an authentic Levi's Shirt.  Waste of money.  I have no idea where I'm going to wear it or if I'm going to wear it. Don't buy it."
These are a tad on the small side for a 9. I'd say they are more like an 8.5. They are rough and the ties are very long. I am considering returning these. I ordered the brown color just for reference.
Runs small- I didn't like it.
"Hide from a plastic cow glued together at the seams and machined to look like alligator skin. Falsely imprinted with ""Genuine Leather"". Returned."
The wheeled bag is pretty flimsy.  The handle feels like it is going to break off at any time.  Pay more and get a better bag.
This shoe runs narrow and the bungie doesn't pull open enough for him to get his foot in it. I had to return it.
"I was hoping, for the price, these would be better quality than the cheaper competitors. I found some for around $1/pair and they are the same quality and I like the other prints better. They were packaged the same as the competitors too."
returned..not a good fit
I got these to have some warm socks to wear around the house. These are not warm at all. The material is not thick and these provide no warmth over my Dr. Scholls athletic socks.
I ordered a size 6-6.5 but they fit like a 7 and I wear a 6.  I consider Ecco to be an expensive shoe for a fashion sneaker.  There is zero arch support and they have taken out the tongue and made it a slip on like I see in cheaper shoes.  The other thing is that the elastic and toggle have very little impact on tightening the shoe. I will be returning these.
"Could be a bit wider, they fit my foot but I am not sure I like then enough to keep."
"I recently switched from being a long-time Adidas wearer to Asics for my walking, running, gym and tennis shoes.
I bought the Gel-Resolution 5 Tennis shoes this year and while I love the light weight, comfort, arch, long-wearing outer sole; I am very disappointed with the  deterioration of the mesh on both the left and right upper sides at the toe flex point. It appears that this is a design flaw in the Resolution 5 tennis, shoe since more durable synthetic leather is used at the flex point in my other Asics running, walking and gym shoes.

For $90, I expected more from Asics, and as a result, I will be looking at other brands for tennis because of the design flaw and deterioration of the upper mesh of the shoes.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ASICS-Men-s-Gel-Resolution-5-Tennis-Shoe/dp/B00DHFTF60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ASICS Men's Gel-Resolution 5 Tennis Shoe</a>"
"Garbage! Laces keep untying, slippers falls off."
It was not the size indicated. It was way too small.
"Didn't last. Three months and the shoe shows serious distress. The cloth on near the leg is all torn up, laces have open ends, and it looks seriously beat up.  Another NB shoes have lasted months, and I and my kids love NB, but surprised this one had so bad quality."
Too short and ran smaller than expected.
"This runs very small. I ordered a large and it fit like a small (I'm an 8-10). The detail of lace was very nice, it was very soft cotton. Too bad it won't fit!"
Did not work for a rip in my rubber Doc Martens. The sealer started peeling off within 2 days even though I let it cure for 2 days.
Runs very small I ordered a large and it fits like a tight medium.
"The damned thing is too small!!! When you put it on, it crushes your nose, and you can't breathe right..."
"Nice quality and good looking, but way too small to hold your junk. Feels like it cuts off your circulation."
They are fine if u know the exact size you need but do not go off shoe size because they are way off! I returned them and went to a dance store to get her measured.  I then saw that Payless shoes has dance and tap shoes now.
This is like a queen size blanket. Way too big for the man even though normally an XL would be fine. We called him Yoda when wearing this. Had to return.
"I have worn 22"" neck shirts for 30yrs and never purchased one that did not fit me until now. The shirt was actually about a size 20"""" and I ended up giving it to my nephew.  I would recommend big men looking for a 22 neck shirt to stay away from these style shirts."
"I had to do a return.  This, in my opinion, just don't pass as a Swiss brand for me."
"Beautiful shoe!  I am a true 6 wide and have to size up to 6.5 when shoes do not come in wide.  But even sizing up, these do a number on my pinky toes.  I suffer because they're lovely and have a low heel, but by the end of the day I want to kick them across the room."
"Standard high quality expected from Saddleback (which is why this review is two, rather than one star), but unsat as a wallet.  It takes real effort to get a license and card into this thing and even more effort getting them out.  Cash really doesn't fit.  Even after wrestling the cash into it's pocket, about a quarter of an inch of the cash sticks out."
"After reading the customer reviews, I opted for the larger band size (which fit fine), expecting that (as is often the case) the cup size would increase slightly as well. Not so. The cup size (DD for me) was on the skimpy side. Returning the item since I spill out everywhere."
My son said this was kinda heavy and didn't really look right. He decided to just go with his old backpack instead
"the dress is very in ugly person, the colors do not look anything and very poor quality.
dress came to me with many manufactures and damage is used. not buy not recommend.
the pink wine chocolate clear to me looks very ugly."
"The blouse looks CHEAP. This was an expensive blouse and looks horrible. Looks NOTHING like the picture. Smells horribly. Simply DO NOT buy this. It is low quality. I thought it was a joke. I looked forward to receiving this blouse and yet I was shocker and horrified. It is not worth the price or any price whatsoever. It is a horrible, horrible product."
"I am 5'3 & 115 lbs. I ordered size small. It was way to large to wear. The quality looks good and the style is nice. Unfortunately, it was a terrible fit."
"Please avoid buying this sweatshirt at all costs!! Don't make the dumb mistake I did.  You know the material they use for wrapping glass products - the foam wrap? Well, that is what it appears this sweatshirt is made of. It is also incredibly small. The designs on this sweatshirt are horrible, but quite humorous at the same time. The side orange ""leather"" decorations  say, ""zeal style, boys & fashion"". Not sure what that is about, but after getting over the shock of how crappy this sweatshirt is, I laughed. The best part of this ""sweatshirt"" is the reindeer emblem. I am not sure what type of reindeer they have seen in China, but this emblem closely resembles the devil. So, the sweatshirt I planned on wearing to keep me comfy and warm will likely be cut up to wrap some glasses or something.... can't think of a better use for it. This will most definitely be my last purchase from China."
"While the material was nice and comfy, the sizing chart on this item was off. It was at least 2 sizes too large"
order a size larger than what you are.
Very itchy and stuff!
The shirts were too small and the pants had a weird fit. The legs were too small and the waist was huge so the pants fall off of my son. He wears 2T in Carters and other brands with no issues. I wasn't happy with this order at all.
*Update:  I loved these earrings when I got some but less than three months later all the gold color has worn off
"Eew. I was really hopeful with this bra, I am pregnant and wanted something comfortable to support my growing chest. Like other reviewers, I found the underwire to be horribly uncomfortable and dig in. But the worst part about this bra is it makes my boobs look like they point out to the sides and look really far apart, somewhat reminiscent of a bad Madonna costume from the 80's. Skip it."
"While the design is cute, I found the fabric too thin.  I am not a large person.  In fact, I am average size (I normally wear a size 8).  However, I prefer a heavier weight to the fabric of clothing I wear.  This seems cheaply made.  Also, I chose a size large just in case it was clingy, and even though it was roomy in length and the armholes, it was still clingy through the bodice area.  Obviously the top is cut small."
Definitely runs very small! Quality isn't good either very cheaply made.
"Had to return, the sizing was much bigger than anticipated"
the zipper broke completely. Crap
"I wish I could give it no stars. It isn't the top in the picture at all. Wrong color, size is WAY to small. I wear a 14,ordered an 18,this would not even fit a 12 yr old girl.  (I tried) so disappointed! !! Would not recommend."
"This dress was meant for a very short person. However, the cut was very uneven too. Just not a well made dress."
Sizeing wrong
i thought  it was great the for no reason plastic hem ;oked out would  like replacement
Puss In Boots... ridiculously disproportionate sizing of this over the knee boot. could have used more accurate measurements in the description. no returns. yuck.
Broke the first time I wore it - doesn't take much to break so make sure you don't hang a valuable charm on it.
"I ordered this scarf as a  possible gift for my granddaughter but sent it right back after it arrived.  It is nowhere near as pretty as the picture--the material looks rather cheap--and I was sure she wouldn't like it and neither did I!  Still, with Amazon Prime I was able to return it without having to pay shipping--a wonderful bonus.  Amazon is definitely my ""store"" of choice."
The way it's cut really isn't flattering
These are a little uncomfortable and definitely run small. They're cute but I wouldn't buy again.
"WAY too small for a very thin 19-year-olds wrist.... other than that, it was cute, but unless you are a child, I would not purchase!!!"
"they are clunky and the sizes are either too short and crushes one big toe, or way too big. nothing that fits both my feet well.. I found this odd."
Material seemed to be low quality leather. Item returned for refund.
Stop working three months later
"This shoe horn basically does not work. I had to try it to find out, but it is too difficult to get such a long handle on the back of my foot/leg, and the thick plastic does not allow the foot to slide into the shoe. I don't recommend it."
I had to return them as they were way to small. Felt like they sent me a pair of skinny jeans. Tight on the thighs and almost couldn't button it. I've been wearing Levi's jeans for over 30 years and these were way off a size 38 regular straight fit.
"One camera one lens and two very small accessories.  I've use this bag several times and I've tried and tried to like it however it's just too small inside for my digital camera, 70-200mm and 17-40mm lens with lens hoods. I would return it but I've used it thinking I could get used to it but I can't. I do like the single shoulder sling idea, that works well.

The green and zipper net pouches are poorly designed, when you unzip them, items fall out as the zipper is on the bottom, if they put the zipper on top, you would have access to items without them falling out onto the ground.. This would be a easy fix for manufacture and would greatly improve its rating."
My wife was unable to get this shoe wide enough for her feet. The size description said they were extra wide but they weren't.
Doesn't fit at all and the least flattering bra I've tried on.
We got this for our teenage daughter & had to give it to our 6 yr old nephew it was so small!!
"Not impressed... Size wise, it was fine. Barely stayed on foot, very light weight, but immediately went to goodwill, not worth the return shipping :("
"The fabric is so cheap looking that after I got my leggins on, it looked like I was ready to attend to the next comicon as one of the street fighter female characters. . . I guess it can wait for Halloween. . ."
"Disappointed , because I wanted these so bad. the cut is awful , they would fit a 5 year old, but not a grown woman.  I am 140 pounds Choose the medium , no bueno. The fabric has no stretch, made me feel like  a circus freak."
"Heavy. Small. Uncomfortable- the toe box is narrow and rubs top of toes at knuckle. Heel is too high. Cant imagine wearing these for very long. HOT, but thats the material. Will only use in emergency flooding. Real work boots for everything else"
return this product
"DIDN'T LIKE, BECAUSE METAL FROM CHINA, FROM YELLOW BECAME WHITE AND VERY QUICKLY , SCRATCHES  EASILY"
Not true to size my opinion
Was wripped before it even came out of package. It made it through halloween but hardly.
"I bought a couple items from Dreamgirl and the sizing is about 2 sizes too small. They are super cute, but disappointed with the fit."
"I returned these shoes because although very good looking, they were not at all comfortable.  These shoes were very hard, not at all cushioned. Couldn't walk on them comfortably."
Very heavy and sloppily painted.  Too heavy for a child.  Will end up in the trash.
"Ordered may 3.  Shipped may9th.  received may 11ish.  Worn 50% of the time with alternating another pair of boots.  It is now July 24th.  The soles are coming undone and the sides are blowing out.  I build retaining walls for a living, so I don't expect a boot to last forever but I've had RedWings, Georgia's and Carolinas last well over a year.  Guess the extra $80 for those boots means you get 20 times  the value.  Its upsetting that if I would have bought anywhere besides Amazon, I could return them.  This is BS and I won't be buying anything from Scamazon again."
"Loved the idea of how it looks here, but once I recieved it, it was short ond tight. Gave it to my 12yr old nephew... fit him well."
"Save your money. The crown, which was one of the center pieces of this costume, came broken. Still trying to figure out how to fix it."
Too stretchy!
I bought large for me. That fits on my waist but the legs are too loose. I am thinking about cut that and make a shorts for summer use
"I bought these for my husband. They have a great design, but are so thin and almost see through in some places. I would not buy these again for that reason."
Very badly cut for larger chests
"I ordered a Medium based on product sizing. I usually wear a 32 D, but have a small chest around so usually a medium in a free size type bra works well. These are made very cheaply. I could have gotten past that though. The medium fit well around my chest but the material on the front was not wide enough top to bottom to cover my chest at all. The bottom band became more of the bra that covered my breasts than a band underneath. I read the review on here and thought I'd try it and it would be fine. I have no idea how the girl in the picture made it work, which is why I bought them to begin with. Don't waste your money."
Runs small. No support.
looks really fake. don't like
"I returned these, one shoe was WAY BIGGER than the other one, practically flew off my foot walking across the room."
"This is what you get for producing stuff in China. This amphibious sneakers look okay, but my advice to you is they are smaller than labeled size so if you're going to get one of these; buy a size more than you wear.

I live in Nigeria so the option of returning it isn't feasible so i have to give it out. That's why i gave it 2 stars."
"Just received this swimsuit today and I am SO disappointed.  The quality of the fabric is okay, but the top does not fit or flatter in any way.  Absolutely NO SUPPORT whatsoever.  The foam support cups appear to float freely inside the top, so they do not stay in place at all.  I tried the top for five minutes and was so disappointed with it that I didn't bother to try the bottom.  TERRIBLE."
"Fit so weird, the middle was too long like it hung it was so bad. had to return."
Sweater ripped at seams after one wearing.how disappointing
The heat mechanism was fine but the whole product is just too large and clunky.
It's very narrow
"I like the design and fit of this belt but after just a handful of wears, it is already showing a lot of signs of wear and tear. I do not think this belt will hold up for very long at all."
"I'm sorry but these are very uncomfortable to me.
I have quite a few bostonian shoes, so this isn't really a problem with their shoes in general."
"After the second wash, these pink ones are still color bleeding onto my other clothes. Had to throw them away."
We have two of these with slightly different designs. The build quality is very low quality of a metal alloy and falls apart under its own weight.
Got a 2XL cuz I knew it'd be tiny and it fits like a medium. Washed it once before wearing and half of the words washed off.
I ordered dresses for my twin nieces birthday party. When received i noticed one dress was longer than the other as well as the sleeves color where different from the other dress. One dress ripped during the party as to say the quality isn't the best.
Totally itchy! I could wear it for 5 mins! So if you order it order it big so you can wear something underneath
This should be called extra slim.  Very tight through the legs if you have any sort of quad muscle.
"Are you kidding me??? I received these like 4 days ago and I put them on today to wear while I ran errands and when I got home there were 4 holes in the back of them. I'm not a big person and they fit fine when I put them on, they just shredded when I went about normal life. I'm really upset because I loved the pattern, but this is a joke. They won't do returns either so now I have a pair of garbage."
Not what I expected. Neon stripes and you can see through the top.
"The webbing between big and #2 toe is wide. So wide, that for my foot (size 6), it hurt. Had to return these. Otherwise felt good."
"I got 2 of these for my kids for Christmas, they absolutely loved them until they stopped working later that night!!! Save your money!"
"The body of the suit fits as expected, but the arm straps are too long. Even for a lounging suit it's not a comfortable fit and for actual swimming I'd be afraid of wardrobe malfunctions."
Tight sleeves.  Shirt material and length just feel overall uncomfortable
"Only reason I'm giving this one star is because i finally got to open them up today and was going to use them, but noticed the right lens had a couple minor scratches in the glass, so i will be contacting for replacement. As an avid amazon customer, i expected more from this top tier brand. Will up date."
Okay so I'm going to be very honest hear. The only reason I give this product 2 stars 1 is its adorable 2 my son loves it. However this thing is a total piece of junk. We just used it for the first time tonight and the handle pooped off several times causeing  my son to drop it when it droped which was barley 1 inch of the ground since he's only 23 months it snapped apart completely. I had to put this thing back together several times during while wrangling a 23 month old in a large crowd of trick or treaters. I wouldn't recommend this product at all unless you know of a way to renforce it. But then if you have to do that it's certainly not worth the money.
The sleeves are more like 3/4 length even w the L but that can be cute too. The material is kinda scratchy but suits the purpose.
"Very, slim fitting and tight.  If you are built like a model, this sweatshirt is for you.  If you are a built like a normal human being, it will be too tight in the chest, arms and waist."
Horrible quality through and through. Junk. Dont waste your money on this one.
"Super cheap material.. but I expected as much, I think I bought it for like $6.  Pretty cute though."
"Very poor quality, was originally purchased to be a work dress, my mistake.  Dress has no zipper, was not lined (even partially), material is as thick as a t-shirt.  I would classify this dress as a beach coverup AT BEST.  There are some serged princess seams in the bodice (like a t-shirt hem) so the top isn't totally shapeless, but as it is lacking a zipper and lining, the bottom half is VERY shapeless and the top shows every line of your bra.  Length is weird.  I'm 5'9 and it hit me past a midi length and would need to be hemmed.  This dress is not appropriate for work, or even a casual night out.  I would expect to pay $15 for this at a big box store, not $60.  For reference I am normally a 6 in dresses and ordered a medium and the top was good.  The dress is pretty stretchy, but any more than a C/D cup I would consider sizing up.  Was so disappointed in this dress I posted a review immediately to hopefully prevent others from making the same mistake I did."
"while I have put on a couple more pounds than I would like, my old jeans in the size I ordered still can be worn. I could not fasten or zip the new ones. returned them."
I  was very unhappy with this shawl. It sheds worse than a shedding dog and pretty much fell apart after the first hand wash because I didn't want all the fuzz all over my other clothes!
"I returned them because they were very long, even with heavy socks and the extra insoles."
"The shoe itself has a nice feel to it. I ordered a size 7 (M) which is my size. It fit length wise BUT it's too tight around the toe area. I actually had to take them off twice to make sure they shipped me a 7 and not a 6.5. It feels as though the shoe would've been extremely comfortable if it wasn't tight around the toe area.

The heel is a nice, very comfortable height and overall a professional shoe. I also looove the rubber bottoms so I can walk in confidence that I won't slip; very secure and wraps my foot.

I attached 2 pics so you can see the width of my foot which is not wide and they were still tight. I never buy wide shoes because they don't fit so this one is definitely not cut right so they will have to go back and I'm going to try the 7 (C) which is wide...I guess there's a 1st for everything....unfortunately, the nice croco print doesnt come in wide and it's just a plain black shoe."
"Have to change this to 2 stars, bought these for my wife and after a couple of months started breaking up at the toe line/toe bend line..  Since she likes them for being soft and walky can't give then 1 star, but either we got an OLD pair or it is just crappy materials.  BAD from a company as ASICS, need better materials!  She uses them when we walk our dog mainly.  Should have kept with Merrels for that!  No complains and perfect ""walky"" feelings them.  Merrel Syrens do the job, much better and as soft as these for the use.  Do NOT expect them to last more than 2 months usage, expendable to say the least."
"I guess these are ok, but I sent them back as they seemed very cheaply made. I wish I had taken a picture first as there was visible glue. For someone who is not hard on their shoes or who needs a pair of light weight shoes these might work. These don't weigh a lot, and they were comfortable when I tried them on. I am just WAY too hard on my shoes so I knew this would not work."
"It looked like a baggy mess on me. It's a heavy material and very soft, but because of the heaviness, the top doesn't ""blouse"" out. It hangs. And the tie around the waist is about as thick as a shoelace, so it cuts into your skin. The colors are very pretty but this one definitely did not flatter my shape. I'm 5'7, weight 135lbs. and 36B bra. The medium fit perfectly, right down to the length. If anything, it might be just about 1/4"" too long, but little pumps would have fixed that right up. Sorry to say it has to go back."
"I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust."
Good and comfortable but with 3 uses the sole begin to fall
"The Wig is pretty bad, bur for the price its not a bad starter wig. The liner is visable from the back."
too tight for me to get foot into..  :(
"It's too small, I order twice in large and XXL and still too small. It's for people that doesn't have breast at all, it doesn't have any space for your breast it for skinny people with any curve. Too bad!!"
Worst Fit Ever
"I bought two of these in MEDIUM, even though the size chart suggested a large.  I had to send them back because they were too loose.  I suppose the cut was correct and WOULD HAVE FIT, but they barely held in place.  The slightest tug would send them to my ankles...and remember the size chart said I should have ordered a LARGE.  I sent them back and ordered two in SMALL.  Small fit better at the waist but the overall cut made them too small, so those go back as well.  Champion really should fit the waistband to have more ""grip.""  There's no reason a medium didn't hold securely at the waist when I was already going a size smaller than suggested.  At $6.00 a pop to return items to Amazon, I'm better off going to a sporting goods store to try stuff on in person."
"This product is horrible. It is of very low quality and the displayed sizes do not reflect the actual. Also, to make things worste, the seller has no customer concerns. I regret buying from you."
"It arrived, and it was way way way too small. My 8 year old son could not fit into this. At all."
"Horrible, came folded and unwearable."
"I wear a 7.5, due to reviews l sized up to an 8. I couldn't zipper boots up."
"Worst tie ever. Waited 2 months for this thing and it came and it was too skinny and instead of gold, it was orange."
"The sizing was a little off. My son is 7 months old and I ordered a 12 month size and he may be able to wear it one more week, even with the double snaps.
Also, the ""Eye"" bodysuit is fuzzy where the white of the eye is, and after 2 washes it is starting to fall off.

I'm glad I got this on sale and only bought one. I would not buy again."
The height was from waste to crotch area - not in the legs where I need it.  Just a very strange cut to these pants.  Also very thin - need thicker warmth in WI where I live.
Broke it.
these fit smaller than the chart says and the size it is to be. I bought these for my self but they did not fit me at all so I had to give them to my son instead which they fit him great
"Beautiful when opened, tarnished by the end of the day? Not sure if I received some low quality one but high satisfaction quickly changed to high dissatisfaction."
Decent product for the price. Not heavy duty. Do not overtax the zippers as they will give out. If you pack light for short trips this product should suffice.
"Not comfortable, odd fit, SUPER wide bell bottoms (not ""bootcut"") and in NO way feel like ""pajamas""."
horrible. the gauge is too big and wouldnt even fit my ear.. aside from that its SO hard to get on. don't waste your time or money.
Too Big !
not good quality...too small
These caused my regular sneakers to be TOO slippery in the studio.
The isn't supportive.
Not sized to dress size
"Bought this for hubby as his other wallet bit the dust. Actually, his previous wallet was similar, he likes to have a zipper all around, to keep his content safe. Unfortunately, with the first wallet the zipper broke not long after he started to use it. So I was hesitant to buy another wallet with zipper. This is a different brand, so gave it the benefit of the doubt. So far so good, zipper is holding up nicely.
Unfortunately, the big downside is the credit card slots are too tight, according to hubby. I noticed he's keeping his credit cards in the coin purse, and he said it's because the slots are too tight and he doesn't want to be wrestling getting his cards in and out in the hope that frequent use might loosen up those slots. That is a big bummer, and rather defeats the purpose of this wallet."
"Lee's changed the cut of these pants.  For me, the same size I have been wearing for at least 4 years is now too small and too short."
"I only wear these around the house, yet they did not hold up very well. The top of the sandals has torn across the foot in multiple places. They are comfortable. I was disappointed with how they look. The photos look sportier than the actual sandal."
"Didn't last 7 wears before one of the tabs broke

I went to WalMart and purchased 4 bed sheet corner stays for about the same price I paid for these, which have lasted months of daily wear with minimal appearance of wear.

If you're ok with only getting a few days of use of these, don't have any other options, or don't care about your money, these may do."
This product only andgets one star as it disappointed me when it arrived. The waist is extremely huge making the dress stand out in a hideous way.
If you have no body it's perfect but if you have boobs or a butt than I don't recommend it it's way too short and see through
Very poor quality= Kept one of these ( they sent 2) but I sent the other one bk. not worth the price
They look like 12w not regular 13 and I order a sizes 13 regular. Very cheap quality
"True to color on line. More ivory than pink or blush. Although it's beautiful pearls were already falling off in plastic package it came inside of the box. Was planning to use it on my daughter's wedding day, guess I need to find something else."
The shirts look really cheap when you receive them and they would look good if I was working in a restaurant. Better to spend the money on higher quality shirts.
"it look nice but too small even though I ordered XL, it will fit teens, not for a grown woman"
"I wear M/L and purchased a Large. The shirt is labeled large, but it is way too small. It does not fit like the picture, where it sits below the waist. This one sits high on my hips. And the shoulder seams are 2 inches in from where they should be. Is this a child's? Or sized for asian women? I dunno, but I won't purchase this brand, or from this seller again."
"Ordered several of these. They were inconsistent in sizing, some too big and some too small. Print quality was extremely poor on this pair. Images were blurry and color was washed out."
"I bought this as part of a halloween costume, and it looks nothing like the photos. First of all, it is bright white, not ""cotton white"" like in the photo. The thing is so high it looks like a chef's hat. Also, I'm 6'1, 200 lbs, and this thing is huge on my head. Check out the photos, it looks nothing like the one in their photo. This looks nothing like a Hunter Thompson or Gilligan hat, and it is very cheaply made. I'm giving it away to an old neighbor lady."
to small from china soooooooo
These have to be knock offs or ALL the other feedback's are fake! These jeans feel exactly like burlap!! I don't know how anyone could say their comfortable and there is ZERO stretch in these jeans! Avoid or you'll be disappointed just like me. I'm going to check with some Southpole jeans from a store in Chicago and see if there's anyway these jeans could possibly be authentic....I'm scared to even wash them to even try and see if they soften up as these baby's would probably mess up the motor!
Not working
Huge stretchy band. Small cups. My first return on amazon.
VERY thin and VERY small!!!  Order a few sizes larger than normal.
at least one size too large and had to be returned . I intend to re-order these shoes 1 full size smaller ( results pending ).
I should not have taken the chance and ordered these.  I even ordered up a size and way too small still.
Do not fit properly & look ridiculous on feet
"Must return! Straps way, way too long, and not adjustable.  Want a shipping label for return."
The size was way off and ended up being much smaller than the sizing suggestions.
To small and too short. Fits like an 8. Company has no contact info for a return
"One of the reasons I bought this suitcase was the Samsonite name and in the past their suitcases have served me well. Not so with this one. after about the second use one of the zipper tabs had pulled out of the zipper. A couple more flights and another tab was missing... another flight, yet another tab. and these were not the tabs to the front pockets or expander, the first two table to go were the ones to the main compartment. Had this been just one suitcase I would have considered it an anomaly, but we had purchased two 25 inch suitcases and two 19 inch suitcases that this is happening to all lf them. right now out of four suitcases I am missing 6 tabs. If you look at the zipper the problem is obvious; the part of the zipper that holds the tabs is open and if it is sprung even half a millimeter the tab pops right out. As you shop for suitcases keep this in mind and avoid the Samsonite brand."
"These were ok.  Super stiff and cheaply made.  The lenses are super dark and not that ""clear"".  Not a high quality pair.  One lens popped out in my purse while in the little travel bag it came with.  This hasn't happened to other glasses in my purse."
"Size medium and they fit to small, could barely fit around my thigh to get them on. They were cute but deff for an xs person"
I gave it 2 stars because the inside tie broke the first time I wore the robe. Also there was about a 2 inch gap in the stitching in the arm pit area. It fits very well and is very comfortable and soft so I just fixed the issues instead of returning.
Need to return for bigger size
Color fade away
These jeans was way to long for me if they made them in a size 5 short I would have like them I just wasn't pleased with how long they where
"Much thinner fabric than expected.  I bought early for my twins' Christmas photos.  Wore once for the photos at the end of October, then once at nighttime this month.  We put the pjs on after bathtime and the boys were immediately put into their cribs.  When they woke up 12 hours later . . . both had holes in the seam of the foot.  They were barely worn and only washed once.  They look like they are years-old hand-me-downs.  Aside from the holes, the fabric started to pill after just that one washing.  I have other brands that were worn for months that still look new.  Such a disappointment."
"I wanted to love these, but they don't have enough arch support. I have plantar fasciitis and thought these would deliver the same excellent support as the Spenco insoles (Superfeet black insoles are my favorites), but they don't. They run about a half size too large, are too flat, and a bit too wide. So, I am still on the hunt for a perfect pair of warm winter slippers with excellent arch support. If you don't need excellent arch support, they are fairly nice looking."
Look is great but zero support. Oh well gotta get some new insoles if you want to be happy with these.
Fabric is cheap and tears apart quickly.
very poor quality revento me handle a few days of use as I claim under warranty? not recommend its bad
This MOJO free costume was probably the cheapest made costume ever
"These don't fit in my ear at all.  I've tried on so many different occasions.  They just don't go in.  It's horrible.  I've never been able to wear them.. Also, they're two different colors. One is much lighter green than the other.  Don't buy these."
Real junk. Is this actually Levi material? Thin and lacking any of the traditional feel of Levis. Never again. And it came with tearing!
The change purse area is open at the ends. Change falls out. The zipper doesn't close all the way. Poorly made. Very disappointed.
"The top is beyond small and I ordered the largest size possible. It has zero support and looks bad.

awful and no free return shipping. BS!"
"Really small, thin, and opaque. Not as shiny as in the picture."
"The hat is not really too small, but rather too flat, shallow. It should have been designed with a deeper structure, to be a man's hat. Disqualified for the average man. Otherwise a nice product."
This is my 4th pair of this particular style of Sanuk flip flops. I love them! I bought my first pair in a local store and my last 3 pairs have been ordered from Amazon. However the pair I most recently ordered are VERY tight/narrow and the shoe over all seems small. I'm not sure if they have changed their manufacturing process but I will be returning these and ordering the next size up.
"Very uncomfortable shoes...I tried everything to improve the comfort and its not working. Since I wore them on concrete, the bottoms are scuffed so I guess I'm out there money for them. Wouldn't recommend....."
This bra DOES NOT FIT me properly even though its the size i use. NO SUPPORT. Makes me look like a grandma.
"The slit is poorly placed. Cheap material pills. See through-ish. I bought these for post-surgical couch time. I wouldn't buy these for using under pants. They gather. Size is bigger than expected. This is good if you are overfed and out of shape. These are not good for in-shape, well-formed men. Even if you are well-formed from birth, your dingy will float out of the slip in these -- all...day...long"
"EcoCity Vintage Canvas Laptop Backpacks Rucksack School Bookbags (Red)
Two days into my backpacking trip in Yosemite, the strap broke. There was no place to get it fixed. Luckily, a friend of mine had an extra bag!"
"I bought this for my son based on the reviews. The handle has to screw into the hammer part, the plastic is thin so with the lenght of the handle & the size of the hammer it feels flimsy.

I ended up going to a local store and getting him the hammer that was sponge, that is way better."
"These are really cute shoes, but mine arrived with two differently sized 9 shoes.  One shoe was obviously smaller than the other. I wear a size 10 and ordered down a size. One shoe fit perfectly and one was way too small.  I'm not sure what to suggest as a fix.  Comfortable shoe overall."
Not what I expected. Poor quality
I got these for my daughter because she wanted some work out shorts. When we open them we all started laughing! They look like they came straight from the 80's. They are soooo Shinny and very short! I think its just one of those things that will get thrown in the back of the draw and never worn. LOL... We did get a good laugh out of it though!
"Please be advised each color and size is sold from different sellers.

The Brown Small
Tight at the top for someone who wears small. She loves it though. Ordered with prime. It came quick.

The Blue Small
Also a little tight for someone who wears a small. It's hard to get over her shoulders. She likes it.

The Blue Large
It was the same exact size as the small when put next to it. She could not fit it. I honestly believe it was a small because the size tag was taken out.

The Brown Medium
This one was for me. It never came so I could not tell you about the product. Ordered 2 months ago."
"This item is constantly changing descriptions. When I purchased them they were labeled as GTX. They are NOT GTX. The next day I checked the item description and the GTX was removed from the item description. The very next day they were labeled as women's shoes. There appear to be standard Terrex Fast X Hiking Shoes, nothing more nothing less. So be aware of what you are purchasing. Returning now."
"The fit was as expected, but the elastic waistband of these briefs wore out waaaaay too soon, about 5 or 6 months with normal once per week laundry service."
"I bought a large and they fit perfectly. Except the length. 5' 6"" and saying too long would be an understatement. I am having to pay now to have them hemmed a good bit. Even with the extra expense, I think they will be worth it.  The quality is good."
"I love the color and the way it feels on my feet--but then when I try to walk in them, my little toe slips out from under the X.  The design is flawed--the lower part of the X should come down farther back to enable the little toe to stay inside the shoe."
After a few days my feet were hurting a lot. Not using it any longer.
"This is not a good product to buy unless you NEED it for something. It does zip all the way up to the neck, but it looked cheap and the sizing was completely werid. Plus there was werid stains on mine and I just didn't want to know what was going on, I returned it."
Way too small transparent the material costume. A waste of money.
Bad...plz don't waste money
"didn't like the color, but like the style of shoe.  I have other Asics and love them."
Pretty disappointed with this item. There were seams in odd places on the front of the skirt part and it did not look good.
"I agree with a lot of other customers, this sweatshirt is very thin. There's no way you can call this a ""Heavyweight"" Pullover."
"Too Small.  Not at all impressed with the fit.  It's long enough to be a knee-length dress.  Not sure what I was thinking when I purchased this.  Complete waste of money.  Fabric is basically polyester and looks cheap.  Sleeves are narrow.  Zipper is almost brass looking - maybe a pewter color.  Not silver so doesn't match my jewelry.  Only think I like is the zipper pull and v-neck, but I won't wear this anywhere so it doesn't matter."
"This was a great dress and I liked it... until I washed it.
After my first dress bled and became spotty, I thought maybe it was just a bad item. I exchanged it for a new one and washed even more carefully (according to the dress instructions). Same result, unfortunately. The return window closed by then, so Im stuck with a $35 dress that I can only wear at home."
"Arrived damaged, plus it took forever to get here.  By the time it arrived, it was well past the return window.  Extremely poor quality item.  WAY too small - looked like it was made for a toddler.  Really awful ""yarn."""
Way too small!!  Even on a small neck.
"The top is too big and the bottoms are too small. I am 5'6"" and 120lbs and I ordered a small but it just didn't quite fit in all the right places. Super cute suit, just wish I could have worn it."
"Cheap, but what to expect for $10
Way too biger than expected"
Short torso and completely see through.  Completely.
not good...
Horrible disappointed sandal do not understand why not speak the correct height too much when you look at the side and as you were on top of a tractor. I threw them in the trash so angry but never I buy!!!  Horrible Horrible Horrible
What's hard about to large!?
I went by the provided measurements and you need to order at least 4 sizes up if you want this to fit.... I ordered one size up for it to be roomy... no such luck...
THE DESCRIPTION SAID 5% SPANDEX AND THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT
"Size is way to big.  I normally wear a 13.  I wear a 13 in other style Crocs.  These were maybe 2 sizes too big, I'm not sure yet as I'm in the process of returning.

Update:  I guess I'll never know as there is no option for exchange and the price increased 22% for the smaller size.  Not playing that game."
"They don't have a label, so I don't know the material for sure. But they are definitely not 100% cotton! They feel very stretchy, so apparently with a lot of elastane. After all they feel very cheap. Always those misleading descriptions are really a pain!"
"These look cheap, they are much thinner than they appear in the photo."
Flowers started coming off. NEED some superglue!!!
"I'm a flip-flop afficionado and Rocket Dog has finally, permanently fallen to the bottom of my list for brands.  Generally, their sandals are more narrow than others - no bigs if you don't have flippers - but the straps are typically slightly looser than other brands too.  I'm a size 9 and relatively high arches, but the straps are never snug on purchase.  Further, and worst of all, I have NEVER had a pair of Rocket Dogs NOT come apart at the strap.  They are evidently (that is, all of my evidence reports) NOT constructed with much depth nor strength at strap connection points.  In fact, these very flip flops:  on minute 62 of wearing them, the front point detached on the left shoe.  What had been attached was all of about 1/4 inch of fabric, barely glued into the first layer of the sole
I LOVE the look of Rocket Dogs, these so much I gave the brand one last chance. 5'10"" and made for a circus, I thought they were made for me. Style ratings continue at 8-9 from the Atlanta judge.
But sadly, I could not prove any improvement in construction, durability or service by paying four times what I otherwise would for flip flops.  I hoped.  My hopes were  dashed.
C'mon Rocket Dog, MAKE a shoe at least half as good as you can style them."
"This fit a little small, but I wound up returning them for style not fit. I felt like I looked the frankestain is heels. They are very bulky in person. They did not look attractive while actually wearing them."
"This capsule is definitely pretty sturdy, but the minor flaws made me rethink whether or not this item can withstand the test of time. First off, the color is a blue-ish silver, not really steel gray. I had no problem with the color, but the way the capsule was cut was not precise. There was a small scratch on the outside of the capsule (pictured) that was negligible. However, the threading was not lathed well and left a tiny sharp piece jutting upwards (pictured), which cut a tiny bit off the rubber gasket (pictured, but slightly blurry). I'm sure with that sharp piece there, and with the gasket slightly ripped, it won't last too long. Also, the threading was pretty squeaky as I screwed the cap on and off :/ Returning the product, unfortunately."
"Plastic!  Cheap!  Did not get the item stated.  You wait and wait and you either get an envelope that is empty (happened to me twice)  or it is junk, I believe I am finished with any purchase other than USA and Prime.  So disappointed.  Cannot recommend item."
"looks good, but the sizing didn't work for me"
Donated to school for kids in need.
"I do regret I bought it. You have to wash it 5-10 times prior to wearing, otherwise the whole lower part of your body is gonna turn blue (ar whatever colour you've chosen). For me it's a sign of ultimately poor quality. I should've taken another pair of Wrnaglers insted of Lee."
hurts instep! disappointed in these Crocs!
I love the bag but it didn't come with the wristlet
"Does not Fit , Size  4 E is more like D size"
"First of all, these are a great concept!  To have something to keep sippy cups and toys from falling to the floor in a restaurant or outside is great, but this one is not a good choice.  There are better ones!  I have only used this strap a hand full of times.  On the first attempt, the button was so difficult to punch through the hole that it took more time than it was worth.  Then there was the removal...which took even longer.  I do like that the strap has a removable piece, where you can attach it to let's say a high chair and remove it with one touch of a clasp.  After using this product for approximately the fift time, I went to put the button through the hole, and it came off.  I tried to re-attach it, but it required glue...too much trouble, so it got tossed.  This is a good product in theory, but too much to it.  There are simpler products similar out there."
cheap nose plate fall off easily
"I liked the concept of the key chain.  However, this product was larger than I expected & broke within 4 days."
"The beret smelled like mildew, very disappointed."
"Own several pairs of sketchers in size 8 sent back because these run big.  Also they say are made with memory foam, but it's more like memory ROCK."
"I have very mixed feelings about these shoes.  I love Stride Rite, thats about 90% of all the shoes I get for my kids, since they started walking.  We saw these at the store, didn't have her size so ordered them here.
They fit good, look good, good support, daughter LOVES them and gets a lot of compliments. But with THESE particular shoes, basically, the velcro is cheap and doesn't stick. Consequently, the shoe constantly falls off, no/little support to the foot, the foot wobbles all over.
I've reapplied sticky velcro (command), works for a few days, but constantly need replacing  (the surface you're sticking it too, is basically the old velcro).  She's asking for new shoes for Christmas.
At $50, (and with the stride rite name) I would expect them to last more than 2 months! I've never had a problem with the brand.  We have other velcro shoes that stick to everything.  The velcro on these is almost non-existent.  It's thin, on both sides.
I will continue to buy stride rite and saucony, but no more leepz or velcro."
I bought this and I loved it then I dropped like I've done with other watches and they survived this one didn't the minute hand popped off great watch just don't ever drop it that will be the end
Very lightweight and cheaply made.
"If you are concidering these bogs boots....don't! I loved them when I first got them, and rated them 5 stars. They fit great and were comfortable to wear, but after only 5 months of walking the dogs around the yard they started busting out around the sides. The rubber soles came loose from the neoprene and that was it! No apoxy, glue, or calk would hold. Silicone and other calks would not stick to the rubber soles.
I had never had a pair of Boggs before and I won't have another! I expected more from Boggs! $100 for five months of gentle wear.....not worth it!  Thanks to my poor choice, their poor craftsmanship, and lack of fund to appropriate for another pair of boots immediately, I had wet feet for 7 months! I now have a pair of Muck boots.....they seem to be of much higher quality and comfort.  Hope this was helpful."
"cup size not accurite, too small"
The costume's quality as not as good as image shown on website. Pretty disappointed with the quality. In addition the inflatable didn't work.
"well not entirely sure what I expected when I purchased this but for the price, it's a belt and it does its job.  It smells very strongly of leather - which in turn makes my clothes smell just like the tanning chemicals for leather.

Size is good.  Finish durability is not great.  After wearing it for 2 days the dyed portion in the leather was worn through in several places.

It would be a good work belt if you don't mind wreaking of the leather smell.  Definitely not a dress belt.

FYI: Button snaps hold the belt buck in place - not screws."
"I had previous Nimbus with great results. Don't know what ASICS changed, but they messed up a good shoe. Too bad."
"Maybe the more expensive versions are better, but this cheaper one was ill-fitting in the fingers, especially the thumbs.  Leather was just okay.  Shipped quickly, and return was not a problem."
"I would like to exchange but that's not an option.
Very cute shoes."
"I ordered 6M and got 6W.. I even double checked my order to make sure I ordered the right size, I have to return them now.. Super frustrating."
"had to return, it was too small"
Pretty but it turn my wrist green
Too revealing
Collar is huge -- doesn't lay flat like it should.
"Too large for me, i had to give it to a friend, bad experience"
"I bought a pair of these type of shoes brand new in the box on an auction website.  My daughter wore them for less than 2 months and I am having to repair them where the Velcro is attached to the shoe-it is almost completely ripped off the shoes with normal use.  Also, the loop portion of the Velco is extremely frayed.  I contacted the company a week and a half ago and have gotten nothing besides the canned ""you have contacted customer service, someone will respond shortly.""  Unacceptable in my opinion because these shoes are expensive, especially if purchased in the store.  I do think they are cute otherwise and the rest of the shoes seem to be holding up, but I'm irked that I am having to repair them to make them functional after so little use."
Runs way to small!
These were sooo flimsy and poorly made they ripped right down the back when I put them on. Terrible.
Veryyyyyyu smalll /:
"This shoe looks really good on feet.  However, it is not stable when you dance in them.  I have to return it."
"Pretty average. The fit and rise is ok, but the fabric doesn't breathe as expected and they do ride up in back, meaning you'll still have to duck away to release the cracken once a while."
"They say it was a 2x, it was a large. Gave it away."
This was simultaneously too small AND too big.
I purchased 3 pairs in different colors and I did the same size for each of them. This pair was really small.
"The shirt was very wide and my son is very thin and he is also 6'2"" and the arms where very short and and the bottom didn't even cover his belly."
Chain is okay  but  cheap looking crystals...aweful!
very disappointed in undersized shirt
broke in a couple of days
pretty color...horrible fit.
"The fabric was terrible, synthetics very unpleasant to the skin. Dont recommend!"
"The sizing is off. I use this brand and always a 36C but this fits like a 36D. Also, the stitching on the back is poorly designed. The ridge constantly digs into my skin like a tiny twig. Very uncomfortable. "
These are NOT sized as shoes would be normally.... I ordered 12M and they are like 11-1/2 and too narrow. These are tight fitting shoes... both TOO NARROW and TOO SMALL!  Be careful here- and buy much larger than you need!
"The sandal is super cool. HOWEVER, the canvas is not flexible and was chafing against my skin, which made it very, very uncomfortable."
"I sent these back...I love Kate Spade, I have shoes and some of her jewelry but these glasses seemed poorly made and for  $70 pair, I expect them to fit and be well made...They were a gift so I'm not out but I wouldn't buy them again.  Its too bad!  The color combination is gorgeous...They also came with a nice big case, bright orange which would be easy to see in a deep bag..."
Great looking shoe but had to be returned because the right shoe was pinching into the base of my pinky toe. It was a cramped fit. The left shoe seemed okay. Maybe it was poor workmanship on the the one shoe and just my bad luck but I didn't want to take a chance on an exchange. Great looking shoe though and nice tough leather.
"Too much arch support. Felt like I was walking on a large rock in the center of my foot.  If you have high arches this sandal might be OK, but for me it was just too much arch support.  All the pressure of mu weight was in the middle of my foot rather than spread ober the whole foot evenly."
"I had Originally ordered my daughter a large because shes so tall etc.  but after reading many reviews of this running BIG .. and how soft it is, great material... Im disabled so its hard for me to get out shopping so I tely Heavily on reviews etc. but I was so saddened yesterday that I received A extremely SMALL. no way this is even a medium... length is fine, but aside from my not wanting to give it to her (who wants a snug hardened sweatshirt? ... its NOT soft and made so great like the reviews also stated. Its not like I can Easily go out and return this since Im alone. So Im very very disappointed. Im sure I just got the bad Apple but Im truly not happy."
very cheap not like the ones i bought last year
"I think that color and design is very nice.  However, this particular shoe does not have good arch support and actually hurts your feet.  It is too high and no support for top half of the foot."
Because of the reviews I went a size up. No luck. The straps are just too tight.
Not the size/style I expected
"I ordered a half size, and these were still way too tight."
"ugh. I don't find these comfortable at all. They're a  lightweight rubbery kind of  shoe that makes my feet hot and sweaty, the inside is too bumpy and rough and my knees started aching after walking around in them for less than 15 minutes. Walking in them is not a pleasure.

I suppose I will use them around water, but it's kind of disappointing because everyone seems to like them."
i didn't like it at all and i returned it for a refund the meaterial was cheap part of it had fallen off and there was a tare in it while in the packaging!
doesnt fit well
The iron-on batman log came off the first time through the washing machine...
I ordered a larger size and the jeans were marked in a larger size but the fit was exactly the same and too small for me.  I believe these were mismarked.
"A few reviewers said that the shoe runs small.  I bought these in my regular size but my big toe hits the front of the shoe. The width of the shoe, especially across the toes, seems particularly wide -- almost like the width of a man's shoe.  Since my toes are cramped by the front of the shoe, I must return them.  Good arch support.  Well made.  But it really does run small."
I wear a XL ordered the XXL can not get over my boobs
"It was thick after i put all of my credit cards in the wallet.  Without the cards, it's nice and compact.  It didn't work for me i returned it."
"The socks are wonderful and comfortable - until you wash them. They shrunk to almost half their size. So after wearing them once, they are no longer wearable. What a shame."
The straps are clear and the watch itself look like it's made of cheap clear plastic.  I was expecting a white watch.
Really big looks like it would fit a 5yo
"Got the 2X large after sending a pair of 1X large back.  They had the same fit as the 1X large, maybe even smaller."
Returned it. Costco had a better quality one for the same price
"I was disappointed with these flip flops.  I own a pair of Sanuk Yoga Serenity flip flops, but couldn't find them anywhere online, so I settled for these, thinking they'd be just as comfortable.  I ordered my usual size 8.  When I tried them on they were way too small, at least by a full size (too short and tight across my foot).  Also, the yoga mat material isn't as thick as the Yoga Serenity flip flops.  If you do order these, I highly recommend going up a full size."
"I have anumber of Fit Flop clogs, and I like them a lot. I figured these would be the perfect summer clog, the shape is very similar, and yet my toes are free to the open air. Unfortunately they don't fit at all the same. They are too tight around the instep, and longer in the foot bed. I was greatly disappointed. Not giving up on Fit Flops, I'm going to try their actual flops. But lesson learned, I will go into a brick and mortar for my first pair so I can try them on before I order anymore online."
"I am not often wearing it. After using 6 months, strap is broken from two points. I attached the pictures, it shows how it is broken. I never recommend anybody purchase it. It has very low quality."
Horrible ripped as soon as I put them on
sucks.. way to small for specified sizing.
These were way too big.
"comfortable, but too big and too long"
"WTF Merrell! Learn US shoe sizes.
I'm a 9.5 in sneakers and dress shoes, always have been since being an adult.
But I order 9.5 and they are way too small without socks.
I send them back and order 10s.
Now I can barely get into them with socks on!
No room!!!
Keeping them since, I'd tired of the hassel and they just barely fit, maybe they will loosen up on break in.
What's the issue with the getting shoe sizes correct? !!!"
tight in thighs big in waist
"dispappointed, it is so large and very stiff,  jusk like  cardboard. Maybe it turn to a little soft after washing. never buy it again."
These are ABSURDLY too small. Don't bother wasting your time trying to find out because you'll just have to drive to UPS to do a return. I usually wear an L or maybe an XL. An XXL was skin tight.
"I've always bought this brand and style of panty and they are different now. They are made smaller, the waist is shorter too. I bought some from the store and thought maybe amazon would have some ""old"" packages so i ordered from them and the same problem. I've tryed my regular size, a size up and a size down, in all of them the waist is shorter.  DONT LIKE THAT"
If you have large ankles then this sandal might work for you. I have normal sized ankles and these sandals are sooo large around the ankle they don't want to stay on. I am a size 8 and ordered the 7/8- The length should work for a 7 but the toe thong feels uncomfortable for my size 8 foot.
I bought the largest and the pants I can't even pull up.  I'm not plus size either.
I like this hat except a total deal breaker is the brim around the hat blows up and down on windy days.
"Material awful (scratchy and feels cheap), flimsy-feeling, too short and way too wide. I also got a pair of Propet sandals which are also too wide; I wonder if this is a problem Propet has in general?"
Awful shape. Makes your boobs like cones. No support. Returned.
"I have an existing XL/XXL robe from a different company that I use at home, but wanted another to keep at my girlfriend's house. Got this robe in the same size as the other, and it's easy twice as large overall. I kept it because it was useable and quite comfortable. But this robe goes down to my ankles, not the knees as the photo (and my original robe) do. So if you're looking for an exact fit, beware.

I removed stars from this review because after washing it one time, it's been dropping little black fabric pills everywhere around the house. Repeated washings and drying have not improved things. I will replace this with a terry-cloth robe in the near future."
"The description claims licensed and 100% cotton. What I got was a 100% knock-off. There are no tags indicating anything and it's a no-stretch, shiny material that doesn't breathe. Also the image is blurry/grainy and poorly printed on."
I really the look of the shoe but my shoe size is a 13 and thats what i ordered but these don't even come close to be able to fit correctly.  I would say that if anyone was to order these shoes or shoes from DC they should order a size up or they will have to return.
"Wrong size but did not offer proper size, so returned"
"These are not leggings; they are tights. If you wear them to work with a thong, and bend over your co-workers will see your bare ass as the nylon stretches over it."
Was made poorly.
"The size was way too large, I returned them."
"I just got these and I'm starting from 12mm but I can tell already the measurements of the tunnels are off. Everything was neatly packaged and seperated but there needs to be better accuracy here. I'm also alittle skeptical whether these are really stainless steel. Another crucial point I need to make is that these tunnels cannot be put into freshly stretched ears as the deep groove for the o rings are very deep and would tear up your ears especially when they are freshly stretched.  I will use the tapers but will not touch the tunnels until after they are healed, if at all. The grooves are just too extreme for me. Your ear will literally sit in them while trying to get them through."
"The closure would not open.  It was welded shut.  I requested a return. I even printed out the return label.  I received an email from the company stating that if I really liked the bracelet, I don't have to return it.  They would be more then happy to send me a new lock along with the connecting ring.  It would be easy for me to fix.
I agreed seemed simple enough.  The email was on July 15.  Here we are almost 15 days later and haven't received the replacement pieces.  I will throw out the bracelet and call it a day."
"The tool may have been okay if it arrived in one piece. The handle was broken off so you are not able to use the screw in feature.
For $3.25 its not worth my effort to send it back.
Will try to find a metal tool instead."
"I'm usually a medium in scrub tops, and I was swimming in this one! The design is super cute, so I'm going to try to exchange it for a small and see what happens. My local scrub store doesn't sell many printed tops, so I'm stuck with ordering online where sizing can really be hit or miss :-/"
"The waist on these shorts are too big and the legs are too tight. I don't have large thighs, but I can't wear these.  I normally wear a size 6 and have a 27"" waist, so I bought size 7.  Too bad since they seem to be nice."
"i really liked the dress, but the top did not fit.  we tried to adjust it, but it did not work.  also, it is rather long, drags on the floor.  the color is preatty, i like the short in the front, the waisline was good, but the ""bra area is simply too loose fitting,"
The dress came with part of the zipper sewn into the fabric. Plus it was too small.
The size is not what it says!! I need a refund for my shipping charges of $15.95 as well as original purchase price
Wore them two times and nylon tie clasp broke.  VERY poor quality. I have another different pair that lasted for yr and half. Amazon refunded my money back.
I knew it was cheap but the chain is horrible (Bought another chain for it). It looks nice... but the pendant gets hung up on the chain. It doesn't slide back and forth so it leaves the pendant all askew on my girl's neck looking very sloppy. I will probably return this item if I can convince her to let my first Valentines gift go. She wants to keep it purely for sentimental reasons.
Not for people over 150 lbs!  My option
I plan to no longer purchase this shoe because within 2-3 months of wearing them for only a 2 mile walk every day there is a hole worn in the back of the heel. I've purchased approximately 4 pairs of these shoes & it's happened with every pair. It's a bit disappointing that for the price they don't hold up better.
All tho they are cute shoes they are to narrow not at all good fit for a chubby baby foot
Garbage.  These are now a part of my gun cleaning kit.
I loved the suit however only my leg could fit it was that small!!
The pants are nice but the elastic fold over band is too loose so they don't stay up.
The shoes I got appeared to be used. I bought them on the lightning deal for a bargain but it said new. They run a bit small and are not wide. The shoes are good looking besides the defects.
I didn't even get to use the stash. The glue came off when i peeled the strip off and the hair kept falling out of it.
This skirt does not look good on me.  I think it runs small.
Sequins scratch her skin.  She won't wear it
"My feet are really narrow in the heel. These shoes were snug in front of foot, but loose in heel (like most flats I try). I started blisters on heels in 10 minutes of walking. In addition, there's  seam on the inside that rubbed my pinky toes. But they're SUPER cute, nice sole, good arch support, if your foot is more normal shaped, might work for you. I'm taking mine to Goodwill."
Can we exchange for a bigger size and what do i have to do. Thankyou
I was so happy with my jacket. It was lighting up. A little snug. Then the zipper got stuck. It was hard to undue it. When I tried it the next day is started malfunctioning. And would no longer light up. I even put new batteries. This is a total piece of junk. I like how it looks. But I paid extra for something that doesn't work. This was my trial run. This company makes cheap mechanics.
These long tanks seem somewhat small and not as stretchy as other ones I have had. I will keep and wear but not real happy with the material.
Didnt fit
These were too big and too stiff. They were not form fitting and didn't look good. I ended up returning them.
not the typical support you get from Mizuno
"Somewhat tight in the front toe area yet somewhat large in the heel area.  Will be returning.  Just trying them on however, they appear to be very comfortable and might work great for someone else."
Terrible.  hard to get sneaker on if you use these in all of the holes.
this wig arrived without the flip at the bottom. extremely curly as if it was a long curly wig prior. it also had chunks of knots and did not look anything like the wig ordered.
Order a half size or size higher
"I bought this believing (based on what I thought I read) that this would help me with my work outs at the YMCA.  Got it yesterday; tried it today.  Basically HATE it.  The first few minutes it was great and cool, but I'd just started.  By minute 10 of a 65 minute work out, this had become hot, ponderous and suffocating.  I HAD to take it off; when I did, it was HOT (the temp of my head).  In the end, I used it like a damp cloth; letting it cool and putting it on the back of my neck.  I could have done that with a small towel and saved the money.  If I had a re-do ... I would NOT buy this.  I don't know how it can say it will keep someone cool for hours when it was miserable within just 10 minutes.  Save your money, use a wet towel."
"The point of wearing a racer back bra, or at least my point was to avoid the visible straps of standard bras while wearing certain tanks. This bra was very visible because of the deep cutting side seams. I wear other Wacoal bras of a one size smaller size(I ordered large after reading the reviewS) and it was still too uncomfortable to breathe comfortably(while the cups themselves did fit).  I guess I could have tried another size larger, but that just seems ridiculous."
"I was so disappointed in these expensive socks. While cute, they developed a hole in the toe after the second wash. And they were washed carefully and hung to dry. So disappointed. I have far more inexpensive socks that lasted years without getting a hole, and those I wished and dried in the dryer."
returned. not true to siz
"i understand that crocs are lightweight, and i really like the mary-jane style i have for cooler weather.  i was hoping to find a commuter shoe (to/from house-metro-work) for the warmer weather but i just didn't feel like these were sturdy enough.  they're being returned."
"I ordered this bracelet for my mother. I had it sent directly to her home for mothers day. I was just with her this weekend and saw the bracelet. I was very disappointed with the condition the bracelet. It was unexceptable!
The silver coating was worn off and the charms were worn and tarnished. My Mother is 83 and does very little. This worn out bracelet was not from 2 weeks of wear. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this item."
"I gave these to my daughter for Christmas and she immediately wanted to wear them. However, after wearing them for only a few hours, the earring separated clean off the post. She was riding in the car and all of a sudden said, ""Mommy, my earring is broken!"" It hadn't gotten caught or anything, The post with back was still in her ear and the earring was laying in her lap. Very disappointing!"
"Unfortunately, this product is of Very poor quality. As soon as I attempted to take off one of the clip-on camisoles, the snap actually came off! This was right out of the box! I had just tried it on to see how they 'install'.... I was being especially careful to hold the two edges of the opposing snaps because the fabric seemed rather thin and delicate. I didn't want to rip it. It STILL pulled one side to the other and came completely off. I would NOT recommed this product."
I didn't like the material that these leggings were made of and they always slip down at the waist and you have to keep pulling them up at the waist area
"Not the most comfortable of fabric, and lacks support."
"Looked like good quality, but I washed them before giving them to my husband to wear. I washed them according to the instructions and they shrunk a huge amount. They were a 38 to start and I'd bet they were barely a 32-34 after the laundry."
Poor print with blurry lines. Thick paint application makes it look far from vintage.
"Not impressed, quality of the material easily worn through... big toe had poked through each one of these socks after the first wear.. the only good thing about the product is the silicone on the heel which does keep the sock in place."
"Price fits quality received.
Not extremely comfortable."
My charm broke!!! It's not worth the hassle (or money) to send back. Also turned my arm green where it touched. Not a good product but it was cheap.
I love the style of the wallet but after having it for just a month the cheap zipper broke. I would have like to at least get my money worth out of it.
"These run very large. I bought them for my almost 5 year old in the 4-6 year size, and he can not wear them. They are also not very good quality. It was a waste of money, and I had to go to the store and buy other gloves for him anyway."
Hard to open.
"The 1st day i wore it, I took a shower and it got water in it. had to send back"
"I got them in brown.  Comfort is good.  These shoes look like sneakers.

This shoe is slightly longer-shaped than Rockports I've had in the past.  The material at the bottom (the sole) is different that what I've seen. If I rub my hand on it, it gums up like an eraser and produces a little waste that comes off.  That's strange but other than that they seem normal.

The upper material has elastic material in it.  The sole is flexible but not too thin.  This is not the kind of shoe that lasts but it is comfortable.  The upper material is soft and appears to me to be easily scuffed, although I haven't had it long enough to confirm.  The product I'd recommend to keep those scuff marks from being visible is (select ""brown"" in the drop-down):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiwi-Scuff-Magic-Shoe-Polish-BROWN/dp/B000UDEBNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiwi Scuff Magic Shoe Polish (BROWN)</a>."
"The quality is actually not terrible, but this was way too big for me (I'm an 18/20 and 5'2""). The legs fall down and the waist is too big."
"I did NOT receive a discount for my review and, I can tell you, these things are SUPREMELY uncomfortable. Spend a little more and get something better quality."
"The look of the ""beading"" or whatever is just horrible. The colors are rainbow - not gold/silver metallic as I expected. I have a wide large foot and the elastic did not work for me. Super tight. Not that fit mattered, they were just so terribly cheap and ugly looking."
"Although I liked the unique color/material of these shoes, they were too narrow in the instep to be comfortable and worse yet, they had an area that was unraveling so I had to return them."
"I ordered this and it fits like a short shirt, not a long one that could be worn like in the picture."
must return this costume..very cheap..i am  not happy with it..the zipper not on right and just not worth the money...
"Not as effective as the artificial fiber in Cool-Jams for night sweats. Material is nice and soft, but much heavier than similar PJs in cotton. Neckline is nicely detailed."
The size chart runs very small.  Nice color but it did not fit at all.
they keep you pants tucked in but they're a lil bulky and uncomfortable. Was not a fan.
"As giving a star rating is required, I could base it solely on the size issue. I would have preferred to give not star rate it, rather just note that the width was not adequate, & that I sent the shoes back. I ordered a size based on feedback reviews noting that the shoes tend to run a little large. I would normally order either an 8 or 8.5 in mens shoes. My feet are wider than the nearly ubiquitous ""B"" women's shoes offer, so I order men's. I do believe that the length was adequate, but the width was not. I cannot speak to the quality of the shoe, nor the integrity, as I personally did not challenge any aspect but the size, which was not right for me. As the purchase was made during a ""Today's Deal"" promotion, I was not given the option to exchange the shoes, rather only received a refund."
"Shoes slipped with each step. I could imagine the ""blister"" growing. I liked the look of the shoes -- too bad about the fit."
These have no elastic headband. They come right off my son's head after a few wiggles. Such a shame because they are cute in person. They keep his clothes drawer company.
As the other reviewers said
I ordered a size large for my wife (normally medium) but received a size tiny.  I will give it to my eight year old grand daughter and hopefully it will fit.  Maybe XXL or XXXL would have worked.  Trying to guess the sizing from china is a crap shoot.  The faux fur looked good.
too small. does not look as nice as the picture and very very see thru. i will not and can not even wear this.. waste of money. might as well wear nylons thats how see thru this is!
These run super small....need to adjust their sizing....not true to actual sizing for other manufacturers.....
I usually wear an XL in everything. This was too small I had to return it for a XXL. Then I was charged $7 for return shipping. Not happy about that at all.
Bows on top came off too quickly. Would not recommend at all as this is a huge choke hazard.
Liked the look but not the fit...too short.  Shoe does not come in half sizes.
"Don't buy these unless you're a size 0!!
Oh, and they're painted on jeans. Horrible product!"
"It was cool and all but the baby blue-ness was just ugly. I bought it ""black"" but then the baby blue-ness had to be there and made it look hideous."
"Not so happy with this bra, yes it felt like I had nothing on and it showed, no support what so ever."
The item does not last. My daughter had this less than 4 weeks into the school year and the hook to hang the bag ripped off. Not a sturdy or well-made bag
"Large hangs right at my hips as someone who is 5'1"".

Navy is same color as tile, not same color as picure. Much darker than image. For that reason, 4 stars. It is however very comfortable and what I was looking for, hard to beat for the price!

It does shrink if you wash it though, cold or not. I couldn't seem to get it right again so thats a bit of a let down but you get what you pay for. Simply due to quality I give 3 stars.

Edit: Reduced to one star. The wash on a delicate cycle ruined it, the back is completely short like a bolero and not like pictured at all. Does not maintain shape well not matter how much I try to care for it."
"It is a very beautiful dress but unfortunately it's literally falling apart. I haven't even washed it yet and I wore it only three times! The material is like paper, it very chip. It is once ware and throw away dress!"
"I thought these looked great, and I love my Cobb Hill Flats, but these were just too small and narrow."
Has kind of low quality lining
"I received this as a gift. I never got to use it - it tried to open itself up at some point while still inside of its sleeve. I deducted this because the stick was extended in my closet.  When I took it out, it wouldn't work.  It won't open all the way or close all the way, and it won't lock.  I never even got to take it outside :("
"I didn't receive the item as pictured. I ordered ""black"" socks, and instead got 3 black pairs, and 3 white with gray + on them. Disappointed."
Was not what we expected. Won't buy again.
Husband disappointed
"The picture does not show that this is a tight fitting garment that shows EVERY small detail of your figure. So if you are an average woman, skip this, it is not as nearly as pretty as the picture. If you are super super slim it will look just fine."
The pearls were different sizes
"Seriously!  The tongue is some cheap synthetic material that bunches when you tighten the laces.  The shoes them selves are clunky and don't ""give"" like you'd think they should.  I'm very disappointed.  They're going back in the box and back to Amazon."
"Not wearable after washing, they just shrunk way too much.  I had even bought a larger size."
"I'm a size 12 and the small makes me look 6 months pregnant. Its also very short.

Haven't worn it yet I don't know what I am going to do with it. I make try to make it into a blouse.

Very disappointing."
"The size is identical to another Shimano shoe I've worn for years, but this one is so narrow I can barely get my foot into it.  I seems really cheaply made and I will be returning it for a refund."
"Like previous comments, the screws came loose after a bit of wear and they are very weak. Snapped in half on me."
Cheap and tacky looking
Shipping took way after the deadline. Cheap material. Rips easily. Took a month to get here. (Texas)
"I wear a size 8, and after a hot wash and dry, I'm STILL swimming in these.  If you wear a 9 or 10, they should fit well."
These shoes were smaller than stated size.  Don't order if you can't choose a size up.
Nope don't buy
Wow -mega cheap -mega flimsy - like the same material as a kids birthday party hat - super-super cheap.. I need it for Halloween prop - or I would return it.
Stone fell out. Poor quality item.
Not for a guy with a long torso even though we ordered the tall!
"Ok so I was pretty irritated when I received this to say the least . I read all the reviews prior to ordering and everyone was complaining about how small it was so I took the advice of the women on the reviews who said to order sizes up and I was swimming in it! I normally wear a large in shirt because I'm tall and have a larger chest so I ordered a 2xl since it apparently runs ""so small"" and it was beyond huge! My bust measurement is 36 and my waist is 27 if that helps anyone out with choosing a size I think a large would have fit me just fine. Also the color isn't a red at all its more like a burnt orange."
"Nice looking boot, I ordered the wide width in hopes that they would accommodate my orthotic insole. Sadly, they would not. The boots were too narrow, I had to return them. Thank you Amazon for having a great return policy, excellent customer service. I will have to look at another brand."
Notice the description dose not say relaxed fit! They are a terrible fit and keep falling down even with a belt. Be the the no. 1 butt crack person in your neighbor hood with these pants.
The shirt is too small. The xlarge is more like a medium. So sad I'll have to return it.
"They're fine. Look kind of cheap and stone is pretty cloudy, but I wouldn't expect more for $10.
Update: they turned black after 2 days of wear. This is ridiculous. I've never seen such junk in my life."
"I would give this a 5 star as I Love  Asics.
However this is a minimalist shoe and not enough support for my activity. Fun colors and true to fit."
It didn't pull my breast together as I would've liked but I used it anyway due to short amount of time left to go find another.  The sticky part does stick well to your breast but when you clamp it in the middle it did not fit well.  I won't be using it again but I'm not sure if maybe I shouldve went with another size to make it fit like the lady's in the picture when advertised.
"I don't know if I'm just so used to my other shapers that go up to just below my bra line, this just didn't fit the bill for me. It didn't seem like it would stay in place and didn't hold in what it should have. It was very uncomfortable and gave me an extra 2 creases (one on my rear and one in the middle of my tummy). It got returned immediately."
"Fundamental problem with this shoe is not obvious.  I tried the shoe out for 20 seconds and my socks were coated with an invisible slimy coating and it made the carpet area slimy.  I used my slippers to step on the affected area just once and my slippers were slippery for the whole night.
- on the bottom of the shoe is stated ""chemical resistant"" and thus the manufacturer might have added chemical coating to make the shoe resistant to chemical and to keep the rubber soft.
- sole is too soft.  I don't like it but it is OK.

On the plus side, the shoe is decent as decent men's rain boots are so hard to find.  This rain boot had a high enough heel and it seems like it would last several years of use.

Personally, I don't like this shoe due to the invisible coating and the gel like/squishy sole."
"I wish I could say I love these shoes. The looks are fantastic, reminds me of mountaineering boots / oldschool hiking style. The materials seem decent, the outsole grips nicely. They really just look amazing. But that's where it ends.
This shoe has one major flaw. It's the padding around the toe box. I'm sure you have read the many negative comments by now, talking about the width of the toe box and how narrow it is. My feet are by no means big or wide, I wear one of the smallest sizes and having ordered the wide width shoe, I'm barely scraping by. I tried 3 different sizes with this shoe. The wide model just ups the size of the overall shoe, the toe box seems maybe only slightly larger, if at all. I wonder who this shoe is designed for? Children with large feet? However, I figured out it's not so much the width of the toe box as everybody says, it's the padding. There is some sort of sewn in cloth lip around the edges of the toe box. I get the idea behind it- you wouldn't want to feel the actual steel toe digging into your feet, I get it. But the ""lip"" is not padded. No, that would feel great. They have cheaped out and thrown in literally just that- a cloth lip. The material is sharp. It feels bunched up. It presses and rubs HARD on the side of your toes on either side of the shoe. It's as if you left a piece of the stuffing paper from the store. It also essentially decreases the width of the toe box. It's stupid.

The quality is nothing to write home about. They are cheaply thrown together. Things like ripped threads, spots of glue here and there. Somebody also sewed in the wrong size tag, which was then ""fixed"" by gluing on the right one. Little things. For the price, they should be made at least a little better than that. These are not office flats. They are work boots, the whole idea behind product as such is comfort and durability."
"Remember Madonna's cone bra? That's what it fits like!!!! Yes, my breasts fill it and it fits fine around my body. I don't understand the cone look at all."
Too small. My 6 m old could not wear them. End up giveing away to my friends
"I was the Grinch in this year's parade and instead of buying a costlier costume I bought this one.  It's okay, but cheaply made.  The jacket doesn't have buttons/holes so I had to use safety pins to close it up.  The hat was aweful."
Scratchy and very tight. Not at all comfortable.
"Robe gets fuzzies everywhere, literally everywhere. I have really tried with this item but it has not topped leaving fuzz everywhere it goes. Poor quality even though it's cozy."
"Cheap.. missing multiple gems and runs extremely small, and this is coming from a person who has a very small writs. It fit my 7 year old the way I was expecting it to fit me. I was just very disappointed in the product and the fact that I bought them as gifts for my sisters... would not buy again."
Didn't like the fit or the feel of the fabric so back they went.
The elastic bands are just for show. I thought the elastic portion of the shoe would fit around the top of my foot. Do to some issues I've had the material is hard and restrictive. I wore these for a few seconds before I yanked the off. And that was my good foot! I have a wide foot and narrow heel so the back of the shoe gaps in an unflattering way when I take a step. Good price but right now the shoe is unusable.
"Very cute shoe and looks comfortable, however the Velcro ripped off the straps after less than 2 months. They won't last more than a couple months tops. I should have spent more money on a better quality shoe."
"I am not super impressed. After all of the great reviews I expected a fine slim profile wallet. This one is constructed with quality metal like they advertise, but functionally it has a lot to to be desired.

First off, unless you did your homework and actually researched how much stuff (cards) you can fit in here, you may be disappointed. I have 10 in it and it's not maxed out, but it's close. I believe they said 14 is the max. If you max it out, it will tear up your cards.

Secondly, if it is not full (see above), you have to stretch the Velcro very tightly to prevent the cards from falling out. There is nothing over the open side where the cards go in and out to keep them from falling out. Other models of Trayvax wallets have a piece of leather with a snap, or elastic, but this one has nothing on the bottle opener side. Only pressure holds your cards in.

Third, It's great to be able to open a beer in any situation, but I'm not sure that you need this ability with your wallet. If you do, it'll be once in a blue moon. Alternatively, on a daily basis, the bottle opener will snag your clothes, poke your fingers or get you into an unnecessary conversation at the airport.

Fourth, the bottom of the wallet does have parachute cord to keep your cards from falling out through the bottom, but why not just have it looped like it is on the sides? Instead it has a useless plastic thing that pokes your butt when you sit on it.

If I could do it over again, I'd shell out the extra cash and get the leather one. This one may work for some people, but it's not what I want. It feels awkward and uncomfortable."
"Pretty Bra and the band size is spot on,  but the cup is sized totally different than any other I have purchased.
It is built well and looks good, but the depth of the cup itself is shy by at least 2 inches in my case!  The width of the cup would be fine if the depth was right..."
"The weast elastic band is too cheap and loose, the pants do not stay on weastline. They keep falling down. The rubber band needs to be a stronger band. Therefore I returned all the product."
I bought 3 of these and waiting a month almost and got them today they advertise pure silk they ate not . The tag even says 45% silk 55% polyester.
"Lesson Learned. I should have kept the money and made my own shirt. Whoever cut out the graphic did a terrible job of that,  the graphic on the shirt is smaller than what I expected, and the graphic overall is just terrible to look at. I am highly disappointed in this buy especially for the price.

You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, sir. Bravo!

  - Tinny Tim"
Too big for me. I thought it would of been something small and cute
"I thought of returning them but thought I could wear them to kick around, and use my other NB Leadvilles for running, however, the interior of these shoes are abrasively uncomfortable..."
Im usually a medium and got an X-large and it was sooooo smaaall. I do not recommend it at all.
"I bought these for my fianc&eacute;. After wearing them for a few days, he complained that they would not stay up, and ended up throwing them in the trash."
I ordered one size up as suggested.  The medium still felt like a small.  I cannot get the item to fall off of my shoulder as in the picture because it is that small.  I decided to try to return it and order a large because I still really like it.  I submitted my request through Amazon over 2 days ago to return the item and the seller has no responded.  Very frustrated.
Thank you but i thou them in the trash
Cheap and garish looking.
"Not waterproof, not warm. The only thick and warm material is on one little square right at the top of the bootie in front...the ENTIRE shoe cover should be made of that material!
Yet another junk cycling shoe cover.

They look cool is about the only plus I can say."
Not very flattering and seems cheap
The straps were just too light of a color on me.
Very light weight shoe with zero foot support. Hated them and returned them. Bought a pair of Reebok Yourflex with memorytech padding instead. Best shoes ever!
After every wash it gets bigger and bigger. The cotton is too stretchy. Colors faded.
These are extremely tiny! Cut but not worth the price. ... $1
"I've only had these for about two weeks and I feel as if I bought ""knock off"" slippers.  They are very, very thinly lined, don't keep feet even remotely warm or supportive.  I've never had slippers feel like old worn out slippers within a few weeks. I would have returned, but I don't have packaging and/or info to arrange for return.  Due to my spinal injury, I rely on comfortable slippers and these are such a disappointment, I'm amazed."
"I typically wear a Large, and I got an XL in this.

Putting it on, it was really tight trying to get my chest in. I think it was made for someone very skinny.

Once I got it on, it was still a little bigger than I liked."
"i got this and it does look like the picture but when i use it doesn't stay in place, it is ok"
"My fiance and I ordered matching titanium wedding bands. He's a perfect 10 and I'm a 7. When we ordered our rings they took the estimated 7 days to arrive and his was about a half size too large. We thought that would be fine, especially considering he can't wear it with his job. Mine, however was more than a full size too large. I immediately contacted ""Rumors"" to request a trade and was sent a generic ""we'll get to it within 2 business days,"" message, meaning that my Thursday evening message wouldn't be returned until Monday. After 9 days however I still hadn't gotten a response. I've sent 2 emails and waited more than 2 weeks with no reply.

Something as important as my  ill fitting wedding band demands attention and certainly better customer service than this company can provide."
"The bra was really tight fitting even though I size up -- bra size is 38b, ordered size 40 but still hurts when I wear for long periods of time. I wouldn't recommended it."
Cheap not worth the wait and time  and money. Not sure about these of seas products!!!!! disappointed.
"I bought up but they were way too small...very uncomfortable. I wouldn't buy again, Although they came quickly, no problems there."
"After one wash, one wear and another wash ... you could see through the bottoms.  Very thin, poor quality product."
Super thin. Runs small. See through.
NOT rose gold.  It's plain old yellow gold!
The shirt itself is cute but doesn't fit right. It is a weird stiff material. Not form fitting or flowy like in the picture. It's also very long. I ordered a small and it fits like a medium
"These are dollar store quality.  I have holes appearing on the second wear in places I don't expect to see holes.  If your calf is even slightly larger than average, then these socks will be too tight.  I didn't spend a lot so I guess I shouldn't expect a lot in quality.  They're on the thin side and I expect all of them to have holes soon and be unwearable."
Extremely small. I wear a solid size 8 ordered an 8.5 and cannot wear them heel hangs off back and toes are right at the tip of front of shoe. Too late to return.
"These pants are thin and hang oddly, no way I'll wear these out in public! The main redeeming factor is they are long, for tall people."
"I have many danskos. The best and most consistent fit is the pro xp clog. I wear danskos because of chronic foot pain.  I have two mule-styles and now these. Well, they just aren't comfortable. They are super cute and I get complements every time. But I also get blisters where the leather meets the skin on my outer edge of the toe box. Needs stretching. Makes my feet raw. Hopeful they will work out. I will update if so."
I spent extra time to find and choose wide length for this purchase.  The shoes are NOT as wide as some of my regular width shoes and hurt both my right and left little toes.
not at all like the pic
I washed the shirt and the white is now very dull. I washed the shirt in cold water and the black still ran . Good for one wear!
"Not flexible.
Quality worse than expected."
Cheap looking. Will not order from this seller again.
"Its way too small. I love the print, but wish the fabric was something a little richer."
"Awful, I took the ring out of package and the diamonds were falling out. Don't waste your money."
"The arch in these sandals is crazy high.  I have pretty low arches and that makes these shoes almost painful to walk in.  I feel like I'm hobbling on the outer edge of my feet.  I can only imagine how they'd be for someone with truly flat feet.  Ouch!

The high arch also tends to flatten my foot out making it look wide and attractive in these shoes.  Unfortunately I wore them outside to really decide if I liked them or not so I can't get a refund.  I will not be ordering these sandals again that's for sure.  Too bad and they seem like cute comfy sandals otherwise."
I purchased these in a size 38/32 thinking they would be perfect as I float between 38 - 40 depending on the style but upon putting them on they were too loose and too long so I had them altered and they are still a little too long for my taste also the seam on the left leg is crooked (more towards the front of the leg instead of the side. I won't say they are knock offs but Im wearing a size 38/32 in the same style right now and just purchased 2 from Khols at a Buy 1 get 1 half off that fit me perfectly so you do the math. The pair I'm wearing I had to redye them because the pair I bought here were just so wrong I'm embarrassed to wear due to the lining being so close to my shoes tongue and the size being so jacked up. I've learned that some things your just gonna have to hit the mall for. I will never buy jeans from here again.
My gf wears a 20-22 and these are SO small. She thinks 16 MAYBE 18 would be more realistic.
I returned this in less than 2 weeks.  The clasp broke.
Not to happy with these. I bought multiple and the band's ripped and faces shattered with the least provocation.
Did not like at all..too sloppy
"I decided to try on my outfit before Halloween to make sure it fits. The purple all into one fit ok and the tutu was alright but hard as heck so it will have to be ironed out or it will make you look like a puff balloon. Now that waist bad....HORRIBLE!!!
First of all it doesn't fit even though outside the packaging says ""ONE SIZE FITS UP TO A SIZE 14/16"". That must be in kids size. Then it has these flimsy cheap buttons you suppose to attach to two pieces of stretch band. Great because I only had one band and the other wasn't there. Then the waist band wasn't even neatly stitched. They left the edges raggedy and just pitiful looking. The costume is not cute without the waistband so now I have to make a way or find and BUY another costume. They will not be getting anything else from me because I was highly disappointed with this costume."
Ended up returning it.  The cut was strange even though the image was cute. I could tell that the iron-on cat would wear off in the wash and dryer and the neckline wasn't anything to write home about.  Wasn't worth it to keep.
"Other shirts I have bought my husband from Carhartt fit.  This one did not.  The sleeves were about 2"" too short.  It was a bit snug in the body, also.

I do not recommend buying this shirt.  It is foreign made."
"Cup size was odd, seemed too wide and open at the top. Would not order again. The body portion fits nicely aside from the ribbing which bows when you sit. Unhappy with purchase"
It looks nice but it gets tangled alot and the ring that connects breaks off so easy! Look somewhere else
"My husband weighs around 230 pounds and has a large frame and this was a bit big on him, mostly around the neck and arms. The muscles in the shirt are barely padded, I had to cut the fabric, add a lot of extra cotton for padding and sew it back up. It worked for the costume, but was definitely not a perfect piece."
"...Both cuff links were the same color! But, they weren't! 1 was hot pink (as ordered), the other was dark red. Returning them for refund & reordering. Returns are fairly simple. HAVING to return anything, though, is a pain! Hopefully Cuff4U gets it right this time!"
"The pendant is really small, I couldn't even use the chain that came with it, so I'm using another chain.  I think it is better to buy jewelry in person."
Sizing is not accurate at all.  The 6-9 month shorts fit my two yr old nephew.  Very disappointed
"I bought this shoe and did not wear it until after the one month window to return it had closed.  The shoe fits true to form, but after 2 weeks of wearing it, the left shoe began making a large squeaking noise that will not go away and since I could not return it, I have been wearing them only when I am out on the trail. The shoes are comfortable, but the squeaking noise is very annoying. So I am going to have to purchase another shoe as I am dissatisfied with this one."
"We thought we might get more than one use out of each pair.  We hoped that these would help protect our new wood floors.  Unfortunately, after one wearing, the seams split and the fabric wears thin.  Though not expensive, discarding them after use seems a waste of product and resources, so we won't be re-ordering."
"I returned it. It was GIGANTIC on me. For reference, I am 5'3"", 125 lbs, 38-26-38 and I ordered the L based on the size charts...I easily could have gone down to a S."
"Too small for my son, would have not purchased if I had known."
Thought they were bigger was disappointed
While the product is Coffee in color and lined that is all I can say about it. The fit was smaller than I expected and they have a polyester outer material that is shiny. It snags and gets picks if you even slightly rub up against anything. Not at all practical for everyday wear.
"Being a 34DDD, I've had a lot of minimizers and I won't sacrifice shape just for the sake of reduction. This bra made my DDD's into pancakes. I shouldn't feel my boobs when I put down my arms. Returned the next day.

Edited: I wanted to add my go to bra for a decade has been the Bali Women's Satin Tracings Minimizer Underwire Bra #3562. It keeps the girls out of your pits while still giving them great shape and the shoulder straps are wide with lots of padding. Great for all day wear and it's very slimming."
Very small :-(
Two words: pointy boobs.
"Beware- you get what you pay for.  Mine broke only a week after buying it.  Of course, it happened to break while I was on the beach, so all the stones scattered and I couldn't even put it back together.  Don't waste your money on this... huge disappointment."
"I can not believe these leggings got any positive reviews. Even after reding the other negative reviews I thought I would take a chance because it has good reviews too.
Do not order, reasons why ..... Material it loose and sags. I have been pulling them up all day. They smell bad. Everything sticks to them. They have two holes in them that I did not notice until I got to work. The waist line goes up to practically my armpits. They are itchy. They are thick but you should not ware unless you put something over them. The crouch seams are weird.
DO NOT BUY!!!!
Only gave 1 star because I had to"
size are too big.
I wasn't crazy about the way this one looked
"Not as shown in the picture, definitely unhappy with this purchase. I ordered a small, way too loose at the top and does not ""hug"" the waist as shown."
If you have sensitive toes then do not buy this shoe. I wanted to use these shoes for walking. They look conformtable enough right? Well wrong! These shoes rubbed up against my pinkie toes so badly that I began to develop corns in which I did not have already. The shoes is definitly cute but I cannot wear them at ALL. I am saddened that I purchaced shoes that hurt so awefully.
"This is complete false advertising! It definitely doesn't close automatically ! Furthermore it's hard to manually close. And when you finally close it, it's bulky and doesn't close compactly."
"very poor quality, it was too small.it didn't fit around my wrist.it broke the first time i tried to wear it .It says it was for men but actually it should be for little girls. This is the second time that I buy something from amazon that doesn't meet my expectacion, first item was a leather necleage and it was a horribe product made in china somewhere. so when buying jewerly amazon is not the place to look for"
Not as pictured at all and not even close to the one customer photo posted. Cheap clasp. The weight was nice but it looks like it's for a woman.
Very warm but lost it's shape after one month.  Not worth the money
Instep is waaaayyyyyyyy to low.
"I ordered this in an E cup, but it looked like a D when it arrived.  Way too small."
"To get that pouch effect from the front, you would need to buy a size 2 or 4 inches less than you would normally wear. Don't buy a 36, choose a 34 waist or even a 32."
"to stiff hard to get into comfortably. Tried to use one time and , decided nope this one is too stiff"
"This is a beautiful ring, but I've had it for less then a month and the stone already fell out. I don't know where so the ring is just garbage now. So disappointed."
"The costume is cute however it is very poor quality. My daughter wore it 3x before it split up the back on both sides of the zipper. The material is thin and cheap, not repairable."
not pick option
Hi! I'm a size 00 and this overall is waaaay too loose on me  overall fabric is soft but bad suspender straps. Super cheap that while trying to adjust the strap it snags instantly.
I wish these had fit as I think they are beautiful. The complaint about being hard to put on was valid. They are just constructed badly
"This dress is terrible.  It's nothing as it appears.  The yellow is much brighter/deeper than it appears.  It looks like one of those dresses you can pick up at the flea market for $10-12.  Don't buy it.  It runs true to size though. I ordered a large and it was too big for me (I'm 5'1, weigh 139; In US size-medium, but I usually order a large on Amazon and they usually fit just fine).  Don't go a size up if you insist on ordering this dress.  The seller was nice though."
The grips on the feet washed off in the first wash. They were useless after that
more gray than white
I ordered a XL which usually fits me but the one I got was way to tight and really short length wise
The 38x30 are way too big!
I bought this thinking it looked nice. when i got it out of the box the edges looked banged up and used. over all it looks very cheap...
"The cup lining is not 100% cotton , has a seam in the middle of the cup that expose the synthetic fabric"
The band by the toe does not keep your feet in. My feet slid to the far front and toes hung way over the shoe. I returned them immediately.
support is not great.  Good for a sleeping bra or for around the house but doesn't make the girls look pretty and gives weird lines.
Inside ripped after first use.
Terrible customer service. Shirt was 2-3 sizes too small.
"Too Small, Not real silver"
I've owned several orient watches this one disappointed me just because it didn't work at all sorry for the bad rating but the watch has to work when it shows up or it just makes me hate it. I Love Orient Watch Company and their watches but this one just upset me. This is a great design and maybe at a later date I will try to buy another one like this.
Cheap material.  Would not recommend.
"I got the xl it's too big my measurements is 42-38-44, 185lbs, 36DD two months postpartum I have a lower belly pouch. Swimsuit is also unlined and no breast padding. Color and style exactly as shown I  got the green."
"Created a very unflattering ""shelf"" booty"

"These boots are warm, but have no traction and are of poor quality.  My wife bought these 13 months ago and with only occasional wear they're coming apart.  She pulled them on today and one tore open(see picture).  At $60 they were not a good value as they barely lasted a year, the Tevas she wears more frequently are 5 years old and in better shape.  I would avoid these boots unless you want to buy new ones annually :("
They look to fake  I don't like it.
completely different from the picture. the hair is way longer and the face is red not worth the money. wish I could return it but its simply not worth the shipping and restocking fee. I used it as a decoration for Halloween and hung it outside
Terrible wig
Love Dr Martens but for some reason this particular shoe dug into my heels and created blisters within and hour of wearing them. Never had this happen before and I have several other styles of Dr Martens I love. I would avoid the Penton.
The shoulder strap broke exactly 31 days after purchase. I haven't even been carrying a ton of stuff. The straps anchor ripped at the seam so no way to repair it.
It looks beautiful but it was too small for my feet. I had to return them.
"This sweatshirt was made for a toddler. Not a woman, not a teen but a Toddler. I'd return it but it's a waste of time and money. I gave it away"
"This is not true to size.  I'm usually a 2x,  UT I bought a 3x and it is too small across the back and the arms. Very disappointing!"
My best friend got me these in memory of my late fiance that passed away. One of the posts broke off as soon as I tried to put it in my ear. It just fell apart.
"I found these shoes to be cheaply made. After just a few weeks of use they looked very warn. At this price point and from this brand I expected more. I ended up returning them no problem, but wouldn't purchase again. The leather towards the back of the show already was showing signs of peeling."
"SO disappointed!! I WANT to love them with all of my heart, but there ere a number of issues that stuck out.

1) When I took them out of the package, I noticed the fabric was worn. There were little pills all over the fabric.

2) As I slipped them on (yes I measured and ordered the correct size) I noticed 6-7 holes, some as large as peas, along the seams. These were clearly not new, and had been worn previously. EW!!

3) The pattern and color of the Onyx that I ordered looked quite dissimilar to the product pic as well customer photos. It is more closely described as black.

I needed these this summer!! I'm afraid to order another pair as to have a repeat performance!! Ug. I guess the search continues..."
"Don't bother with this.
Runs very big. Is pretty thin."
Poor sizing....much too wide...flop off feet.
"These are the perfect example of one size does not fit all.  They fit in the legs where I sometimes have difficulty but left my butt hanging out in the back.  Not for thick girls!  Oh and I ordered charcoal and they sent me black.  No matter, I have to return them."
"The paw patrol scrub top was super cute but mine had an extra seam on the left side of the v neck that was covering a hole so I sent it back. I gave it two stars because it was cute, mine was just defective."
Fits much smaller than I expected and it came with a hole on one of the shoulders.
"These look like Gold Toe socks I've bought before, but both my wife and I separately noted that after just a couple of washings they started to unravel at the top.  Maybe Gold Toe's quality control has started to slip."
"I tried to put these on and quickly realized that the left leg was made smaller than the right. I got the right side on but the left would not go up past my thigh. Also, they are not as sheer as I like and appeared to look more like tights than pantyhose. I returned them and ordered a different brand."
I should have listened to the other reviews but I was hoping they were wrong. I got a size 7xw and they are sooo narrow! Do not buy these if your little one has a wide foot. They are also quite stiff.
"these are not straight leg jeans, They flare at the bottom.  They also run large"
"Loose fitting, yes. Quality socks, no. These are like free airplane socks that are only meant to be worn once, MAYBE twice. And they aren't even soft. Plus, they are weaved so loosely, they're probably better used to drain pasta. Threadcount is like...10 (yes, ten). But sure, they aren't constricting. But definitely definitely not dress socks...stupid me."
didnt like material
Although the fit was perfect I was very disappointed Ted in the overall condition of the shoes. The color (royal blue) was very faded in spots and very dusty as though the shoes had been out on a shelf or something for a long time. The shoe box was torn and faded and in very poor condition. I was shocked.
It is not the same gold in the picture. The gold I received was more of a bronze color. Also I'm a size 6 in pants and the pants fit more like a size 2/4 since I couldn't get them half way up. Also not for people with big butts either.
The elastic band was not very stretchy. My foot did not stay in the shoe.
These were wide and really unstructured. It's was like wearing a padded footie.
Need sizing chart
"Too large to wear under clothing.  Strap adjustment was unhandy, bulky."
"Fit as expected and is a nice cut, but fabric is super cheap and thin (borderline transparent prior to washing). This makes it really hard to wear anything underneath it without showing right through. Wearing a full bodysuit underneath sort of defeats the object of trying to stay cool while pregnant!"
size runs too large
WAY too small.
Clings in all the wrong places and is see through..:(
"Item arrived NEW on 8/16. FIRST OPENED it on 9/9/14. One of the arms sheared off. So for about 24 days after it arrived, it sat in the package doing nothing. On the FIRST time I popped the umbrella open with the button, it broke. Kind of unbelievable. I had a previous one last me over a year and a half without any issues. Some slight rust so I figured get another one. Big mistake. Luckily Amazon has a good return policy for bad products. This umbrella is terrible quality."
"Cute shoes, but not for me.  The fit was a bit too wide for me, so they were uncomfortable.  I sent them back."
Not sterling silver it's coated plated whatever I seen copper color under the bail after I took it off customers it was breaking me out
"Very nice watch. A bit on the light side, but a very nice looking watch.

Only problem is, build quality. They glued the numbers on and they fell off. Never had a watch where all the numbers fall off."
"return policy sucks, sizing sucks"
"Knowing that this type of shoe runs small, I ordered a larger size.  The shoe arrived as a 9.5/10 -- which means that the shoe is a half size smaller than the size 10 that I ordered.  It was crippling, and I returned.  A major disappointment and inconvenience."
"slit on the side goes up too high, need to pin it or wear shorts underneath."
"My son was two months old and it was way too big on him-not newborn size btw, he was 10 lbs at Halloween"
Zipper messed up
Lost its color after several wears. Not good.
:(
Lasted 1 month then holes started to appear. Very brittle material. Steer clear.
I returned them because they were too large and not flattering at all on my feet.
"While these are comfortable, they are even see-through in my home. I have to wear shorts over them, which totally defeats the purpose. They do have a nice zipper pocket on the back.

If I had to, I would not purchase these again."
"not what I expected, it looks really cheap"
"Wasn't a huge fan of these socks.  They aren't very thick,  and are super scratchy and uncomfortable.  Also hair and fuzz sticks to these staticy socks like a mother"
"WAY SMALL!!  I'm 5'5"" and weigh 115lbs and usually wear smalls. I bought a large and it doesn't cover my behind and goes to the top of my thighs in front. It is really tight and really sheer. I wear it as a top but it's just long enough to not look right."
Very thin and loose
I wear anywhere from a XL to a 2X. This 'slip was way too small. It has a built-in bra but my girls were hanging all out the sides and under my arms. I am sending it back and will not recommend.
"This wallet is way overpriced.  The inside is plastic where the bills would go. The leather is very poor grade, and does not even appear to look or feel like real leather."
Still in my closet.
"I have other walking cradles that are sometimes even too roomy, was ordering to replace my old worn out ones and these are too tight :("
"Sending them back. I have lusted after these boots for a year, and was thrilled to see that they were listed at such a great price, but you get what you pay for.  The quality of leather was not the same as the ones I saw in the store, and the fit was short... definitely an 8 and not an 8.5.  So disappointed!!"
"Weird shape. My body is already a great hour glass shape, but somehow this corset makes it look less curvy. I bought two sizes up like suggested and went my the measurement requirements and the corset is somewhat big. thinking about returning it for a smaller size, but I so not think it will make much of a difference in the shape."
"This bag is the perfect size, but it's not waterproof or airtight, and it gets dirty really fast. After using it for one trip, the inside is extremely dirty and it doesn't clean with water and a cloth. During my second trip, a bottle of mouthwash somehow opened up and leaked everywhere outside the bag right around the zipper. Finally, it's difficult to get bottles in because the inside is somewhat unintentionally grippy. It's a lot easier just buying a box of quart-size plastic zip bags. Double bag items and pack a few extra bags, and don't worry about cleaning."
Shoes are too tight one the sides.
"These are really cute but they are much smaller than expected. Especially at the bottom of the short leg, it sinches in and is extremely unflattering."
"I payed 14 for 2 ""belts"" complete waste of money, it is very filmsy the strap is not the same size asthe belt is white and has nothing. Really disappointed. Will return"
It is just a thin t shirt not worth the money  I can get a pack of T-shirts six in a packs for $20
Disappointed with the product
Quality control needed before shipping. It's a pain in the aft to send something back when it fits but someone didn't take the time to make sure the quality is there before sending. The seal between the toe and fabric on the top (so obvious) is not glued uniformly. I hope someone at Cudas sees this review and just sends me another pair.
"Maybe it was a manufacturing defect, but the left flip flop does cut the feet of my son. So he wore it just one time and then he refuses to wear it again.
I'm annoyed because those plastic flip flop are not as cheap, so it was a waste of money.

I use to wear Havaianas and I love it, they are just not good for toddlers."
"I was buying this as a last minute bd present for a male. It's so cheap looking. I can't in good faith give this a passing score when I look at product and say, I think this is worth $10-$12 bucks MAX. It's so flimsy looking and  just doesn't look anything like sterling silver. If it's all stainless steel then I'd understand.  But I thought it said there was both metals represented in description. Yep, that's what it says, but I'm having a hard time that. Just my opinion. For those under impression the Lord's prayer is a good idea on cross...stop, just stop. I was under that impression too, however, the truth is: it's so small, you can't really notice much. It mainly looks like a scratched item. Overall, I'm sorry, I spent my hard earned on this item. This is my opinion, but for the price....this is not worth what I paid for. I've seen some stainless items at my mall, for $10-$12, that were better quality.  A total regret purchase, for me."
These leggings are too shear and not like the leggings Danskin used to make.  They were always the best and now they fall into the ranks of one of the worst.
"I bought these assuming they were regular earmuffs. These are too small to be worn the traditional way. They have to be worn behind your head, which - as a woman who has her hair up most of the time - won't work. I wore them for a while behind the head to test out and was not able to move around without them moving position. They do not sit snug so there is space between for cold air to draft through. I will be returning these, as I won't be able to get any use out of them.
I received them at a promotional discount to write an honest review."
Very light thin fabric (which some may like)  and not a 2XL size. May be good for some but got large guys that are 2XL this is really closer to an XL.
Not at all what I expected. I should have done more research in to this sock. I buy many darn tough socks and have tried other wool socks from other brands. Darn tough are the best so far. I've tried many different styles Darn Tough socks and found these to be my least favorite and so uncomfortable that I can't wear them.  For some reason they feel very rough and the seam at the toes really suck. I just expected all Darn Tough socks to be seamless.
The size was not right. Narrow thru the shoulder and short arms
"The bra is not supportive. It is just like a regular bra. The individual breast placement leaves way too much room for movement. I returned it.

Dianne"
This had an awkward fit. It was to short in the torso and to baggy. I ended up sending it back.
WRONG SIZE! I was so upset when I received my package because the sandals were so small! I ordered at a size 10 because that's my size in nearly ever shoe I buy and I wasn't expecting it different with theses sandals BUT THEY WERE SO TIGHT!! And now i can't return them and I'm just so upset...
"These shoes smell so bad, I can't stand to be around them. I wore them once, hoping that that the ""tire store stink"" would go away after being outside all day at a festival. The sole is made of recycled tires and it stinks. After 3 days on the back porch, I couldn't stand to even bring them into my home, and I put them in the garbage. Due to the smell of the rubber, I couldn't even donate them to Good Will."
Not even close to normal fit in the width of the shoe. Have had many excellent pairs of Timberland boots: these are made very differently and do not fit well at all.
This dress came dirty. Brown streaks on the top in the front. The straps are cheap elastic that aren't even the same color white. The waist is tight and no matter how I adjusted the straps the top laid weird like it had a bubble effect above my boobs. Length was ok but would be too short if I wore heels. Very poor quality!
"These are truly the weirdest shoes I have ever seen.  The laces are just for looks, the shoe actually is a slip-on, and very strangely constructed.  They were completely useless to me, and I returned them.  Strange, because I have always had a good experience with other Asics models in the past.  These are just totally bizarre though."
They came in the mail fast but after using them a few days they started to fall apart. The black rubber around it constantly falls. And metal piece that goes in your ear broke off.
"Not a lot if support and no coverage for pointy nipples.  I guess I should have know since you can see the nipples pointing out in the models picture, but it is worse in real life.  Comfort wise it is pretty good, but I have had better and the poor nipped coverage makes it virtually unusable  in public."
"these are put together weird. The middle bottom part is really narrow and so they keep giving my son wedgies. It's awful and they look weird too. The overall size was right, but not worth it due to being oddly uncomfortable."
This wasn't even recognizable as a camera....not worth a penny. Looked ugly and cheap. Don't waste your money on this junk
Pair.tore.up first wash
The stockings would not stay in the garters. They kept coming loose.
"When I first put these on they felt wonderful, but after three days they were so stretched out I have to wear thick socks to keep them from falling off my feet. I am used to slippers getting a bit larger, but this is unacceptable, I ordered the 7.5-8 size and I wear a size eight, so after a couple of days they should have fit just right, but they are just too big now. If you are going to order, order a size that is smaller than you think you need. One good thing is the sole is good for going outside for a quick walk to the mailbox, which is why I ordered them."
This is very short dress. Does work if you are top heavy (D cup or larger)
Kinda cheesey....
Not at all like picture
The original ones fit much more comfortably and doesnt have the tacky brand name in big letters across the waistband.  Bamboo sounds good but isn't any smoother than their original material.  The double layer on the pouch area makes it tighter and less comfortable for my balls.  I wish I could return these.
"They look really cheap.  I know they were supposed to be man made, but the price is not commensurate with the look and feel of the show received.  I will be giving to Goodwill"
Im so disappointed there are no word to describe it. I should have listen to the review on line. The bra did not fit at all.
Not impressed. Very thin and for the waist size the sleeves were very tight.
it was alright besides all the scratches on it
"The dress I received was not the item I ordered.  It was not ivory nor was this the style.  In fact, the dress was white, strapless and styled differently."
I got these for my 3 year old and they lasted like 4 days they wouldn't stay together the backing kept popping out of the hoop (hopefully that makes sense) lol
"Really comfy shoes, fit superbly, love the style as well. I am overall very happy with them. Can see myself developing a fidgi habit !"
I have big calves.  They didn't work for me.
Does not work. Curled my daughter's toes. Uncomfortable.
Sure shrunk allot!!
Super cheapy.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Thin and cheaply seamed. I'll be sending back.
"Somethings wrong with the left boot. The sole is cut funny and the boot just feels off in some way. Really think the left boot should have been rejected by quality control. I would advise against buying these boots. Returning these.

Amazon: you guys are great. Always excellent service."
"When I received it it did really smell of animal skin. Ok leather is supposed to smell but this was a bit strong and usually leather does not smell so strong.
But the color is nice and the size is good and it has plenty of pockets.
But I have used it for a couple of months now and it is already showing signs of wear.... The top layer is wearing off and it shows that the leather is not of such good quality"
Too small!  Nice bag but so small that not sure who and how it can be used.  Only big enough for my toddlers clothes for one night or two.
"This beanie has no stretch. I guess my head is larger than I thought. Seems like everyone has this brand and for the price, they're not worth it to me. I'd rather find one that looks different from everyone."
"After one year the white around the face of the watch has started to peel off. It looks unsightly, so I will have to stop wearing it. I have this watch in black and so far it is OK."
"Returned, was gray looking and not terry cloth"
"I thought, as a female, I could buy these in my size and they would fit, but unfortunately the material is really stiff and baggy! They were too big and the material was uncomfortable. Not to mention the stripes were SO hard to look at. I don't know if it is just me, but they made me dizzy looking at them!"
"Item is definitely not true to size.  Runs way smaller than the listed size.  Order a size or 2 up for smaller size and the lager sizes like 38, don't order at all. It will never fit unless you are a 34 or 36"
"I bought a pair of these boots a few years ago and I loved them, when I reordered these I was disappointed that the leather was now thinner and there was no longer a warm lining in the boot."
I ordered another style of Next Level T shirts in extra large and they fit just fine (I like them loose with a slight shape to them). I ordered more. This shirt I ordered in XXL as they were said to run small. WHOA do they run small! I will not be able to wear this 2XCX t shirt although I normally wear an XL LOOSE.
These socks would be great but they don't really work if you have big calves. I like them but they don't do the job..
"I ordered a Men's size Large shirt - this shirt is a YOUTH small - AT BEST!!  The screen is faded, discolored, and blurry! I do not recommend!"
Everything is nice except for the rubber/leather parts quality - but u get what u paid for ;-(
Too long & sleeves too short
"I hate them. The cut is different from the other 3 pair I have. Spandex has been added and they fit more like jeggings than jeans.
UGH! Why did Lee feel the need to ruin a perfectly great product?"
Much more narrow than expected. The length is ok. The toe is more pointed. I much prefer the fit of the Tanza.
I think the writeup said this was very soft. WRONG! It it an itchy (and VERY light) scarf. scratch scratch scratch!
"Extremely disappointed.  My now husband and I got this ring for me as a placeholder as we decided to get eloped quickly.  I've only been wearing it since July and already two of the smaller stones have fallen out!  Yes I do work with my hands all day (I'm a florist), but there's no excuse for it to literally fall apart.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Picture is when I first got it...cute ring.  Just wish it would hold up while we are getting my grandmother's diamond reset..."
"This was a size 7-8  I need a size 8 or 8 1/2 so I had to choose this size or a 9-10, which would have been too big.  I have another pair that came in whole sizes. An 8 fit perfect, but this pair is not acceptable."
"It was too narrow in the body width.  Also, I didn't care for the way the handle is positioned.  I would not have been happy with it, and for the price I returned so perhaps someone would enjoy it.  The material and colors were beautiful though.  Just didn't care for the design."
"If are looking for very small hoops these are nice. These hoops are not medium size or large, they are very small."
Had a hole in the side when it arrived...
"This shirt was WAY too large! I ordered a medium, and I thought I was wearing a sheet. I know it's supposed to be loose and flowy....but I felt like a ghost.

Perhaps the style doesn't lend itself to my body type. I'm 5'7"", 135lbs, 32DDD. I sent it back."
"Plus-Size?? Don't believe it.  These should have fit me just fine. They didn't.

I am 5'7"" tall. They barely made it halfway up my calf. If I were extremely short, say under 5 feet, maybe, MAYBE they would have fit.

Very disappointed. A waste of money."
Waste runs an inch to inch and a half small
This was a substitute item for a bra that I Love and this did not fit or feel the same. Style was a bit different than expected.
Super thin material. Definitely don't help when wearing under white or light colors. You can see right through them even under another shirt.
Extremely delicate and fine chain.
"Too short,  I have bought these before and no problem.
These are way too short & did slide down ..Embarrassing..."
gave them away to someone else. wasn't into it.
"The jacket itself is very nice but it is not anything like the size states.  I got an 8/10 and it may fit a child that size.  Since the cost to send it back is so high, it was just a waste of money. The material and color were lovely."
"Fit like a second skin, no support but was comfy. Unfortunately the material slowly disintegrated over the course of a few weeks so it was kind of a waste of money."
It's grey not white so I sent it back.
Dress came with a cheap looking goal broach under the bust where the fabric synches. I have bought other dresses from this seller and been pleased but this is not at all what is pictured. Unfortunately the return window has closed.
"It was to small for my arms, I was vet upset."
Love the quality of Nautica - these pants are warm but the seams ripped in a week - awful quality.  I got it on sale so what can I expect - hence the 2 stars.  Shame cause I loved the colors and softness.
"The front pockets are so short they're basically useless for much more than a chapstick.  The inseam is also too short but I'm 5'8"". Overall they fit kinda baggy with no stretch to them.  I'd return them if I hadn't washed them already thinking it would help with the fit."
"Bad quality, peeling of within a few weeks use."
The shoe is not true to size. Its beyond tight. So I ordered a size up and that was too big. So i returned them both for a full refund. Appearance of the shoe is very nice just not comfortable at all.
El color de la fotografia nada que ver con el que lleg.
"I guess you get what you paid for...? The boots themselves looked nice for the price & I love the style. But whoever thinks these will fit a 16"" calf is insane. I tried on with thin leggings & they were SO tight. Don't even try with jeans, it would be pointless. Gonna have to send them back."
"This bra lasted me only four months before it started falling apart, and I don't even wear it that often."
we returned tis product because of the size being to small
"The picture shows this as a mini/shirt dress, but the size small I received came down to my ankles, and it was the wrong color! The company gave me a refund without complaint, but they really need to fix the picture and description of this item. I am 5'5 and 125lbs."
way too small I ordered 12 and 14 both were very small in the waist with no give.
Great design but that's where it ends the ring I received head low to medium grade stones after two days of light wearing they lost their luster. I had to take a toothbrush and clean the ring to bring back the bling. Too bad because the design is flawless. I would buy it at a higher price if they had a much better quality of stones but what I buy the same ring again no I would pass
very undersized
Cheap piece of garbage. Keeps terrible time
"I typically wear 34X34 pants, but just to be safe because i know Dickies usually run a little tight, i bought 36X36 in these pants...i couldn't even get them on they were so tight.  They are also really stiff and not comfortable.  It's like wearing cardboard."
"Washed and shrunk so bad, couldn't wear again"
"I love this color, but after receiving the item it was so disappointing to see the cheap fabric. I returned it right away and went with the sloan fit from banana republic. Would never buy this brand again"
To fragile
"I have had great bras from Chantelle in the past, in the same size as this one. However, this one run a lot smaller, and was more flimsy, not the quality expected, nor the fit or size."
"the shoes are very pretty and comfortable, I liked them so well that I ordered other colors, great product, nice, after wearing the shoes I started falling, I discovered the heel is smaller on them & I twist my ankle & fall, I have other Dansko with a slightly larger heel & have no problems with them.  Not for the older woman who has balance problems."
"Love a ton of pattys, but this was a huge miss. Very, very long dress- even with heels, it would be completely on the floor. Fabric is too slinky. I highly recommend the reversible dress, perfect length/fit - this one was very different."
"This thing feels and looks cheap. The RFID blocking does work i checked it on one of my scanners. The very first two credit cards I put in the wallet torn the holder pouch and now they are worthless so I'm back to putting two cards in one slot. I would not buy this product again myself.
It does what it says it will do but i can see just within the week I've had it it won't last 3-4 months. My last wallet lasted me 5 years but then again it was a much better quality wallet."
the stones were not alighned properly and have never worn it
"This bag, although a nice size on the outside, is actually quite awful.  The inner lining isn't actually the size of the bag.  It cuts off about a quarter of the way down.  So basically, the inside of the bag has the storage space the size of a medium clutch.  WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  I was SO let down.  I thought this bag could fit my laptop and school books, but I couldn't fit more than my ipod, pencil case, and a calculator in it!

So even thought the picture looks like you're getting a massive hobo, you're not.  If you cut the cheap lining you'd be able to fit your stuff.

But I couldn't even USE the bag because it smelled so strongly of chemicals.  I couldn't get the stench out.  It isn't a smell that I can sort of tolerate, it's a smell that is toxic and makes me light-headed.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS PURCHASE.

The bag was late in arriving to me.  When I opened it I was hit with the toxic smell, and it's not even the actual size.  Not to mention the material feels like cheap vinyl.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different bag, it'll save you money and time."
Both stones fell out of the settings in less than a week. Total junk!
"Runs way too big! Can't even wear it. I am 5'4"" and 120lbs."
The gemstones were very garish looking in person.  It would have been better if they were smaller and less fake looking.  My daughter did not wear them.
returned them.  my hubby wears the same size in almost all shoes... this was too tight and small to keep. nice shoe though. he did not want to exchange he wants to try them on
I bought these boots for a parade. Put them on and the zipper burst immediately. 10 days past the return date and now I have no boots and can't return.  I'd give zero stars if I could.
Painful to wear. Get what you pay for I guess.
Not in large with this- kind of big on me and sleeves too long..
"Cheap, thin see through material. Which I wouldn't mind but it's rough, very , very rough"
"after some washes (not in washing machine) the black parts look very washed out, so sad"
"needs to be a little longer in the front, cheap material and very see through"
I have a Kelty 30L daypack (similar to a Redwing but a model name they don't use anymore) and have had a difficult time finding a rain cover that fits.  Not sure why as it is a pretty standard kind of bag.  Based on some previous reviews I took a chance on this and purchased an Extra Small cover.  This is probably the biggest Extra Small anything I have ever seen and is way too loose for the Kelty pack.  Tightening the draw cord as much as possible does not make this cover snug in any fashion whatsover and it definitely does not keep heavy rains out of the bag.  The biggest problem seems to be at the top where there is no obvious way to tighten it when it is on your back.
"Awful, garbage. There is no comb, so it is not able to be affixed to your hair. The beading is cheaply glued on and when I opened the package, over 20 crappy rhinestones fell out. I purchased this veil on a whim, because as I prepared for my wedding, my 3 year old daughter wanted to wear my (not this) veil, and I thought ordering a cheap one for her to play with would be cute. I couldn't even let her touch it, as it is a choking hazard, on account of the rhinestones. Save your ten bucks, this is worthless even as a toy."
"Because of my wide foot I wear exclusively New Balance or Dunham shoes size 9.5 EE. Naturally that is the size that I ordered these shoes in only to find that they were much too large. I then ordered a size 9 EE which were the correct length and width but still very loose fitting - they felt like they were falling off my feet when I walked. I then realized that the top of the shoe was very high which allowed my heel to lift almost out of the shoe when I walked. As result I sent them back and will continue looking for a different shoe in this style. Too bad because they look great. I have always found these brands to be very consistent in their sizing and always buy them online so this is surprising and disappointing.
Amazon was great thru the entire process so I would not hesitate to buy products from them at any time."
My fingers became green under the ring. I guess you're not suppose to put under water.
This specific suit top did not fit. There was a lot of extra material in the middle and I am size D.
"The hat is clearly for an older baby - we have three grandsons and it didn't fit any of them up to a year old. Please don't claim a hat will fit ""3-12 months"" as it's not possible. Otherwise, the cotton is a bit stiff but durable with a practical tie to keep it on baby. A baby with a large head, that is."
Way too large. Very unflattering fit
Its material is VERY CHEAP. It looks SO CHEAP.
Thin. The paint came off the mustache during shipping and I've never even worn the damn thing. I wanted to wear it to Anonymous gatherings. I am so disappointed. And I'll have to use it anyway.
Not very good quality and too long.
"I was very disappointed because these Skechers shoes were too small. I have two other pairs of Skechers I ordered from Amazon and they are the same size as these and they fit fine, no problem.  I guess the different style makes a difference. I still like Skechers and will continue to purchase them."
Size is not accurate... The xl fits like a small
"I felt like I was putting on a full body tight or leotard for a ballet recital. OMG, so tight. I sent them back immediately. Not true to size whatsoever!"
These fit on the small side
received broken.
Too tight and uncomfortable and I have thin calves. Not worth it.
"The legs do not stay put.
Later: the legs roll up on me and create the same problem as regular panties  I find them uncomfortable.
I reduced my rating from 3 to 2 stars."
"The shirt I received was the wrong item. The shirt was not ""destroyed"", it was a normal t-shirt with none of the destroyed qualities in the picture. When I tried to return the item, the vendor still wanted me to pay for return shipping. I should not be penalized for the vendor's mistake. I would keep the shirt if it wasn't so poorly made with loose stitching and unevenly cut fabric."
"The bow fell of the backpack right out of pakage! And omg, what a horible smell! Returned it the same day recieved it."
"The style and workman ship are what I wanted. 3x size (6x), on label and what I ordered, but the size was comparable to an XL rather than the 2x I usually wear. There was a 4 inch gap from the zipper. I will send the product back, preferably for an exchange for a larger vest."
"This is way small. I could just fit my 13"" laptop, but then there is no room for anything else. The outside pockets have flaps that are bulky and not smooth. I just didn't like, but maybe you would."
"This is NOT designed to be worn after giving birth. The bottom sticks out because of mommy tummy, still big from birth and it looks awkward under clothes.
After a few days I gave up. It's been a month since I had my little bean, and I am wearing my good old trusted waist trainer, not this thing. I'm sure the fit would be better, my stomach is flat again, BUT I rather not. Ladies if you are expecting, and want something to help with getting your ab's back, do not purchase this, look else where."
These jeans are really short-waisted.  My daughter didn't like the fit and neither did I.  If the waist had been normal length we would have kept them.
"Theses are made of incredibly cheap material, and the instruments are a joke because you can't really play them. My 3 year old granddaughter tried to play with them for about a 1/2 hour, after which she put them down and walked away."
"These were falsely advertised. I needed inserts for heels, which is what these were advertised for, but when I got them, they were for flats and I already had a pair for flats. So these went back. I ended up getting the ones I wanted from another company and they are great."
"Glasses were described as having reading portion only in the bottom of lens, but was the entire lens."
Worn once; silver plating has rubbed off on ear wire.  Most likely returning.  Very disappointing because described as sterling and very cool earring design.
"Just received this after a very long shipping time, not what I expected.  It's flimsy, although I won't pass judgement long term as I haven't used it that way.  It's very tall, much taller than my old wallet which was just a bit taller than credit cards.  If the cards were arranged horizontally this would not be so bad because they would be staggered and distribute the thickness of the credit cards. But the way it is, the credit cards all stack on each other and take away an advantage of being taller.  The increased height really serves no purpose at all.

I'd like to say though that this wasn't a flaw in advertising.  I had the pictures in front of me, the measurements were there, the design, etc.  I just liked it a lot more in picture form than actually in hand.

UPDATE:  2-6-16  Just to update after using this wallet for some months.  The wear and tear is terrible.  The stitching is all coming out and the flaps are falling off.  I use this wallet as a normal person, I have about 10 CC's in it, maybe a couple of receipts and a 20 dollar bill.  It goes in my back pocket and comes out a couple of times per day, fairly normal use."
"My son was very excited to get this costume for Halloween. After ordering and returning two other costumes I was hopeful this would be large enough for him. He requires a husky and right now can wear a boys XL or 12-14. By the description of this product it was listed at a Large 12-14, but appeared to be large enough for his height and weight. It barely fit him but we decided it would work. For the cost of this costume it was poorly put together. Immediate the back seam started to come apart. I found someone to fix it only to have more seams come apart by Halloween. Fun costume, poor quality!"
Love the rings but they bend easily and the stones fall out easily
Nice color but that is not a 2x. Do they think 2x women have no hips or breasts?
I buy this watched  s very nice I haven't we're it nat event one way because Y try to open the clip work ones bt after tha I haven't b able to we're it???ffinal 
"3 yards not has tall. Would be better off going to the cloth store and buying 6 yards of plain white tool materials for $2 per yard. Select my lace of choice and sew it myself or go to the laundry mat ask
The tailor or just use cloth glue. SEWING very crude not professionally done."
"The dye was terrible the boots are red and they are covered with black blotches from toe to the thigh as if they were not died at all.
they were sent to me anyway and I know whoever pack then head to see the messey shape they were in."
Had to mend it tooo many times...  Then threw it away
Arrived with scratches on the glass and front of case. Not worth the hassle to return.
"The seaming was itchy against my skin, I ended up donating these, maybe someone else's feet will like them better"
Too soft. Expected a more study shoe.
"Cute dress, but material is not!  It already started pilling after one time of wearing it.  You get what you pay for I guess."
"It's really cute but the words on one side is marked up with flaws and has different lettering font style, some letters are lowercase or uppercase in the words on one side"
emailed customer service for a refund and they didn't reply.  the material on this scarf is extremely cheap; disappointed because I had loved the color a was looking forward to adding this to my collection.
"Heavy, size was too small to fit...ignore this one."
Got a large bottoms were too small and top is weird very upset about this
I bought a size 8 and I'm a size 7 1/2 and they were too tight. I also didn't like how inflexible they were. I used them on one of my running off days at the gym on a cardio machine (Precor AMT machine) and both my feet went numb. I had to take them off mid workout. They're all around hard. That's not good for my foot. I need more cushion not much more but at least some. They also need a few options that are a little tamer in color and to make more black ones since those seem to be constantly sold out everywhere I went. Being sold out in something typically means that's what people want the most. Why do companies never understand that??
They slide all over the place because there's just not enough elastic in them.
"Underswear was much too small, package was open"
"I had a pair of Merrell's for years and wore them into the ground as they were the most comfortable sneakers I had ever worn. I found that I could use a little toe space so ordered a 10.5 W size same make, same design.  What a disappointment.  These were too small, too tight and too hard to even wear.  And they cost $100."
"Dress fits pretty well everywhere, except it does not come together at the top. Very low cut and spread apart.  Definitely not for anyone who is large chested or even moderately  chested.  Very poor design at the top of the dress. There is nothing holding it together.  I can't even wear it out anywhere."
"I haven't had any quality problems with the material like some people have complained about. It feels sturdy and I appreciate the locking zipper feature. However, the entire reason I bought this purse was for the RFID pocket, and IT DOESN'T PROTECT AS PROMISED. I have a proximity key for my car that is vulnerable to the same RFID theft as credit cards and IDs. I have a pouch made by a different brand that is rfid-proof and I can sit right inside my car with my key in the pouch and it totally blocks my car from picking up the signal and recognizing that the key is nearby. Even with the key zipped in the RFID pocket of this purse, my car can still read it from 3 ft away. As a sturdy canvas purse it's nice. But to charge more and promise RFID protection as advertised, its worthless."
The stone was smaller than the knots on either side and metal seem kinda dull. It was not what I was expecting
couldn't get my foot into it
I was a bit dissapointed with this shoe. I was expecting the same comfort that I have with my Merrell hiking boot. I will not give up on Merrel footwear. My hiking boots are pure heaven. Nice that I could return even though they fit. Thank you Amazon.
It is not easy to open or close.  I thought it was bent. I should have invested in a more expensive case.  I will use it for a while because it is not worth returning.
The pants were really cute but the size was small. If a Large/xl was offered they would have been perfect. I am a size 12 in regular pants I was hoping these stretched but they didn't stretch as much as I needed them to.
"not stylish, way too expensive"
"Cute sandals.  But as noted by other buyers, the fit of the toe is a bit strange.  The toe loop fits me ok, but the length from the loop to the front of the sandal is a little longer than it would need to be...and as I walk in them my foot works backwards until they want to fall off my foot.  Regretfully sending them back."
This product is not a chocolate color at all it is more rose so I was and still am disappointed with my purchase. I have not and probably never will wear this watch.
"I'm not sure how anyone could think this lock is effective. I ordered several of these, and, as it turns out, they all have the SAME key. So all someone has to do is get one of these locks, and they can open any suitcase with this lock on it. What good is that???"
Does not fit true to size. I really like the best but just way too small. I would suggest ordering 2 larger than what you normally wear. But very easy to return and quick refund!!
it was a tight fit but had a huge hat space.
"I am horrified to see that over a relatively short period of time, the stitching begins to fail,  at the crotch, below the bib pocket,  and elsewhere.  Once I  noticed it, I did some Googling, and found out that Carhartts for some time now have not been made in America, and are outsourced all over the place.  I was totally unaware that they had gone the Chippewa route

  So just like Craftsman long ago pissed away their reputation, never to get it back, Carhartt is now just another pair of overalls, overpriced since they are not made here anymore.  I suppose I could look at Dickies or Walls which do not make any pretense of being the Cadillac of apparel, but I hope I can find another quality American brand, I am writing this before having done much research on that."
"looks like rags, wires that form the waving edges poke out"
"Perhaps the pair I received were defective, but there is no way that anyone, even with the tiniest ankles, would have been able to close the strap and buckle these.  When closed, the back of the strap was located in the center front of where one's heel would sit.  The picture shows the buckle sitting on the inside of the foot near the back, but it was actually located on the outside ankle near the front.  With a longer ankle wrap strap these would have fit fine since the footbed and t-strap portion were correctly aligned.  The design and color is nice and neutral, but the discs might have rubbed on the top of my foot.  Since I couldn't buckle them, I wasn't able to test them."
Feels like it's on backwards.
waaayyy toooo small .I am a small/medium and ordered Large
Shock absorber needs to learn how to operate a tape measure.  I ordered a 38 band which is normal for me and I was AT LEAST 4 inches away from closing this bra.  If you decide to order from them be aware that you'll need to order two to three sizes in band larger than what you really are.  Sizing isn't even close.
"Had I received the Women's version, I probably would have loved it. The shirt was soft and lightweight. However, they shipped me the men's version, which is WAAAAAY too big, even for me (size 18 and pregnant!). I decided to return it until I realized you have to pay your own shipping. For a $12 shirt, it's easier for me to take it to Goodwill than to pay the postage net a few dollars as a refund."
"I thought I was buying lingerie but it wasn't...it was a dress... or was it a dress?? I don't know?! Im confused. What is a ""oneer?"" Anyhow I thought it would be sexy to wear to bed for my boyfriend but I don't think he gets turned on looking at gas station hooker outfit"
"Nice little spinner, good for 3-4 day trips for business or probably two weeks of casual clothing. The case itself gets marks VERY easily though. I've used it twice and it looks like I have had it for two years.

Nature of the beast with this style of material. If you get it the [product buy it in grey and the scratches will not show up I imagine."
"I read reviews and ordered a extra large.. Wayyyy too big.should have ordered a medium. I'm 5'2,115 lbs"
Leg zipper broke just after a month of wearing. Worn only twice during that month though. Too late to return. Not a good buy.
These ride up horribly.  Avoid them.
I bought these a while back thinking the watch was the real deal. I actually bought this as gift for my dad and well they didn't disappoint at the time. But when I bought the exact same one for myself from the actual DW website the box was different. There was an authentication card and a authentication code thing on the back of the watch which the one I bought here in amazon didn't have.
"material is NOT elastic and as fine as other polyester materials. The neckline opening is too small, the arm opening is too large..the print is nice. Price is ok !"
Sole has little ridges that actually peeled skin off the outer ball of my foot! Also the top rubbed the edge of my large toenail's cuticle.  On the plus side the general shape and cushioning of the footbed was comfortable.
"Material was too thin for Michigan winters.
It was returned  for another brand"
"The toe was much to tight, the strap to loose to hold the shoe on"
These were awful. I wound up just throwing them away. Thank God they were so cheap or I would have been pretty upset. Not worth waiting on in the mail or the money!
"I thought these would be nicer than they are... The fabric is OK. Mediocre stretchy satin that shrinks a bit after you wash them. It's more like what a slip would be made of rather than a camisole. My main problem with these is that you have to wear a bra with skinny, low straps to have it work at all. If you are bigger in the bust (I was a size D to DD while using these) then they won't hardly work at all. Bras for larger sizes seem to have cups that go up higher on the strap for more coverage, so your strap doesn't start for quite a ways up, closer to your shoulder, not below your underarm. Because of this, where you clip the Cami Secret makes it practically up at your neck and too short to cover anything, and they are too narrow to cover anything more than a V-neck. So even if you are small-chested and use these, they won't work if you have a boatneck top. They are only about 5 inches wide at the top part, and they get narrower as they go down.
In theory, these are a great idea. But until they make them with bigger clips so I can use them on a bra with a strap wider than 3/4"", or they make them work for full-figure bras, I'm going to have to come up with a different solution. In all honesty, it was more comfortable to just wear a real cami than fight with these things all day."
"Elegant chiffon blouse but no quality! Don't waste your money! The cloth on the backside was considerably damaged. I have not sent it back only because the return service from my country is more expensive than its price.
Subject to the Asian sizes I have ordered size XL instead of L (sometimes M) that I usually wear. And it fits as expected."
Worst boxers ever. They do not stretch at all. I replaced them two weeks into having them with a better product.
small and tight fit compared to other shoes that are the same size.  Won't be ordering a puma brand shoe again. Too bad because the style looks pretty cool.
"Got them in size M according to size chart it should have been a 10-12, but guess what, the M size is only a 7-8, so, the 2 I got one for my little girl and another for her friend did not fit them. Total waste of money. Can't return them as they would cost me more that I paid. Very disappointed."
"It's a pretty dress but the slit came up way higher on ours than shown in the picture. It was hip high-maybe it had been some sort of malfunction. Two stars though because the dress itself was very pretty,"
A little disappointed in this purchase. I had these same sandals for a long time and when they finally broke i bought new ones and they only lasted a year. And i only wear them in the summer so they lasted one summer. Buying a higher priced sandal I was hoping they would last as long as my first pair.
"The style of this is darling but it's so small you can only put one necklace in it and hang one ring on each side.  Really hoped it would be bigger. Probably would be great for travel so you
don't loose the jewelry you are traveling with, but not much for home use."
The backpack ripped in two places when we tried to open it and the strap tore away from the backpack (we as in adults.) The toys are great.
"These shoes were supposed to be 4E width, but I don't think they are even a 2E width. Don't buy these if you need that extra width."
"I'm 5' 4"" inches tall, weigh 105 pounds. MY DAUGHTER could not get into these. Do not buy unless you are a Lilliputian."
The flowers do not match the bands. They clash and don't look good. Disappointed.
"The quality of the leather is not very good,There are a lot of scratches and other marks"
They are very cute and I was very excited to see them. But could not get my foot in through the ankle area. Too narrow. What a shame. Most of the reviews complain of the same issue. I will return. Not sure if I will try a size bigger yet. But I'm sad because I love the look of these.
"It feels uncomfortable.  I first tried it on, it was good, but as a wear it, I just have to take it off.  The arm pit sides feel weird.  I would not buy this again and wish I could return it."
"These laces don't stay tied tight. I find myself having to retie them after any perceptible walk of virtually any duration as they become loose immediately. They also have started showing ""white"" through the portions where they meet the shoes as if the black outer fabric has worn down already.

Would not purchase these or this brand again."
cheap material and fit is small. medium is like a small
"Right on the breast area there was a weird white slub in the material which far away, against the the heathered purple fabric looked horrible. The fit is ok. Also the shirt has a weird smell even after washing and was packed poorly. Thrown into a box, without any tags, receipt or protective bag so when I cut into the box the fabric could have easily been cut into. Thankfully it wasn't damaged but throwing into a box without any paperwork or wrapping is pretty lazy. Sending this defective shirt back and won't be buying anything else from the seller.

Also be noted, if the shirt comes to you defective in any way, you'll have to eat the costs. They'll take no responsibility for their defective merchandise."
"Not true to size, get a size or two larger than desired."
Who sized this item? It is WAY off.
They were smaller than expected. I'll be giving them to my goddaughter.
"This costume is adorable.  It looks great and my son seemed comfortable in it.  The issue is the design.  The tail is not attached to the costume, it sticks on by Velcro.  Not a bad idea, except that the first time my son tried it on the Velcro started coming of the costume.  I was going to exchange it but since exchanging wasn't an option I would have had to return and rebuy, therefore paying shipping again.  I ended up sewing the Velcro back on but I probably should have sewed the tail on because it came off several times.  This is not a good value for the price."
too small and they wanted me to pay for shipping back ugh :(
"Would not buy this again.
Cheaply made materials"
"Bought for sis in law as gift. She's not a big girl at all. NOT AT ALL and this is anon so i don't have to lie here. She's tall; has some room on her but not fat or even ""thick"". She says she feels like the hulk as its too small in the arms and back.  The measurements are way off I think.  I got her a large in burgundy or wine; it's too small.  I got myself orange in medium. I have big fake boobs. It's a little big on me. That makes no sense.  Total bummer."
Doesnt fix to my body
Has no real value. Small stings hold ring to c-string
These are super cheap looking. Ugh going back immediately.
"These were perfect fall/winter neutral color---BUT---tho they were correct size, they were PAINFUL.  I bought for trip, did not have time to break in, so...FIELD EXPEDIENCY...in pain, I finally bought heel stick on's and sewed them onto upper shoe, split and removed heel stitching, and made small slits in the elastic, added arch supports and then could walk miles and miles in New Zealand and then back home in USA--didn't really want all that effort, but now love the shoes--as I said, perfect neutral color for Fall and Winter---but they should pay you for the effort!!!!!!!"
"The pants fit fine, but are very see through.  If I got a size bigger they'd be too big.  I'm also not interested in having people see my underwear through the fabric."
We try setting the watch trouble then my grandson didn't want it
I HAVE RETURNED THIS DRESS TWICE AND BOTH TIMES I GOT THE WRONG COLOR. I ORDERED CORAL/BLACK...THE LABEL ON THE DRESS CLEARLY SAY CORAL/BLACK BUT I GOT HOT PINK TWICE.
"So uncomfortable to walk in. Worn only once, and never wearing again."
wayyy too clunky.  I thought these were going to be more like infinity hoops but they are way bigger than the part that actually goes in the earring hole.  I bought these to use as nose rings but they make you look like a bull.
I loved them. After a couple if days some how the back fell off. It wasn't because I didn't screw it on tight enough because I learned that with the pair I bought these to replace. Unless my 14 month old unscrewed it. Just sad because now I can't use.
I returned these because they don't have a fly opening
Disappointed.  But it is very cool looking.  Probably some silver polish would revitalize it of which I will do.  I like to wear it on a pinkie finger.
Returned. Chain broke first time I put it on.
Sizes are way too small I typically wear a size 12 I'm a tall 5 foot nine sorta curvy but these felt like a size six way too small. I ordered two sizes up and it just didn't work look like a little kid pants.
"Following prior review advice to size up, the size 9 boot fit fine for a size 8 but one insole was over an inch shorter than the other, so this makes one boot uncomfortable. After two emails to the seller over a period of ten days, and still no response four weeks later, I gave up hope to receive a replacement insole."
"Unfortunately I don't know how this fit, because it was far too knotted up for me to use!! :( I tried for hours to untangle it!"
"I don't like this shirts cut, it was kind of loose!"
"Fabric is rough, it is tight at the waist and the pleating in the front makes you feel fat. Would not reccommend"
"I ordered this and the burgundy pair, the color is off on both items. This is described as dark brown, but the actual color is more like a milk chocolate. No where near being dark brown as depicted which I was expecting to receive."
"The problem is that I remember (and still wear a couple of pairs of) the old Taos shoes. The ones that *really* had the curves and pods that contoured to and supported one's feet. The past couple of years, the construction has changed to much less cushioning, no arch support, no pods under the base of the toes, and thin outer soles. This means that the shoes are not comfortable. I have always ordered a size 10 in Taos, but based on the other reviewers' comments ordered this pair in 11-11.5. They were short. The grey is a nice color, and I really wish that the shoes had worked for me."
"there is ZERO arch support, these are designed so your whole foot rest on the floor, It doesn't say this in the description. Easy to return though with the Amazon drop box at 7-11"
"Very cute but small. My daughter wore it once, I washed it and tried to put her in it again and it was way too short."
Bought for my daughter. This seems to run small.
"Really small... much smaller than I expected... and not due to the seller's error, I received TWO of the same order, returned one box without opening it and was refused a refund for a reason I still have not figured out! Will not be reordering!"
"I saw a previous review that said it runs a little large. I usually wear a medium or a large, so I went with a medium. It didn't fit at all. I don't think it runs large whatsoever. Also, the material was very thin and cheap. Don't expect this to keep you warm. It's about the same material as a tshirt"
these are thin and not appropriate for anything other than the gym or around the house. The top stitching came out of one during the first wash. They wrinkle very badly in the dryer. The fabric is soft. Ok for sleep shirts.
Hey they broke or melted when I was in sun
"First of all, I don't know why people keep saying the shoes fit smaller and such, when on the contrary I think Skechers have changed their sizing of their shoes in the newer ones. I had been wearing Skechers Go Run 2 ever since I bought them early last year. I wore size 7.5 in Go Run 2, which fit like a charm and were extremely comfortable. So I stick with the same size when I bought Go Run 3. They felt so big, but since the ""roomier toe area"" feature seems to be emphasized in this newer version, I thought that was just what it was. Plus I got the limited edition color one (the mint-pink color) which I adored. So I took them for my walk and run for 2 days, and I ended up getting runner's toe and also pulled my hamstring during my attempt to ""break into"" the new shoes. Also the back side of the shoes kept rubbing the back of my ankle since it's made of harder material than Go Run 2 or Go Run 3 Ride - but this issue could be due to the incorrect fitting. Since I bought them online and had worn them outside, I couldn't return the shoes. So I went on ebay and got Go Run 3 Ride at a cheaper price and went down half size (size 7), which fit well just like my size 7.5 Go Run 2. So my suggestion is if you're buying online, since you're still trying the size and fit (whether it's too large like my experience or it's too small like the others here), try them inside the house first to make sure they do fit correctly. Other than the fit, the shoes did feel quite comfortable (though Go Run 3 Ride is definitely more comfortable)."
"I mistakenly walked my kids to the bus stop first time I wore these. I ended up mooning the neighborhood repeatedly as these just keep sliding down. I have hips,I have a booty, no reason anything should fall. Except these have absolutely have no hold,no elastic,no nothing. Fits worse than your pantyhose falling when you are wearing a skirt. At least then you are prepared for it."
"I ordered a two pack of glasses and only received one. Please see attached photo. This is what I received. One package has glasses, the second package was open inside the sealed envelope and only had a microfiber case?! "
Cheap slippers
"Disgusting in different ways, a waste of cash, don't bye....made me itchy"
"I bought this shoe in a size 2 for my daughter, it was way to small, we bought a size 3 and it was way too big, and way too wide"
"One star for the aesthetics of these - because they are truly beautiful.
However, horrible, horrible boots. It takes me approx. 10 minutes to put them on, and 20 minutes to remove. They do not have a zipper or so, so good luck putting them on/off. Usually, my boyfriend has to pull them while I am sitting. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy! If I could I would return them immediately, because they were NOT cheap!
I wore them so far 3 times, giving them chance, but, no, no no... I'll trash them most probably and buy a new pair of cheaper but easier-to-put-on rubber boots."
They were too big on me.
"I have a really short torso (5'1), and it's still short, its just at a weird length, sits underneath my ribcage... haven't worn it. I wouldn't buy..."
"My first review of this was yanked because I mentioned this product is fullfilled by A___n. This product is not made of metal. It is all plastic and coated in a silver paint. Therefore, a misleading product description. I am amazed that it can be sold here as is, especially fullfilled by A___n."
"Very low quality, very expensive"
"Not for everyday wear. Or even once in a while wear. Sole came apart after a few months of periodic use. I wasn't camping, I wasn't going on a pilgrimage. I guess if you do very little walking in them, they make you look cool? Unfortunately that is not my goal. It may actually be impossible, to be fair."
"The description asks you to measure, but then doesn't give any ranges so you could properly choose Small, Medium, etc.  The hockey belt is a less expensive, adjustable (Velcro) belt.  There is no mention of Latex where it attaches to the compression stocking. but it is there and you may need to find a solution to this if you where them daily.  This is a nonreturnable item unless damaged in transit or similar problem, so save your money and buy the adjustable hockey belt for half the price."
"Ladies, this tank does not run in traditional American sizes.  If you purchase, order up two sizes."
"Really soft material and so pretty. The reason for the 1 star is the fact that when I opened it to wear the first time, the right side of the halter pulled right off! It didn't rip though. It wasn't sewn properly and the thread just came right out. I was really disappointed since this was my first lingerie I bought and wore since I had my daughter and now it's too late to return it. Oh well...."
Broke after 6 months.
They were very pretty but one broke trying to put it on
Super thin and looks funky. I knew before I tried it on it was going to look bad. Super unflattering and doesn't do my body any justice.  It's tight on me too. I wanted this so bad too. Bummer. Pocket was up pretty high also
small cup size
"It doesn't look anything like the picture. It's very orange or hot pink, I can't even tell which and it's that really cheap slick, polyester fabric that gets really hot. The graphics are faded and it's just really low quality all around. I usually wear a medium but everyone said it ran small so I got a large and that was a good fit.  Still, unflattering and completely unwearable."
painful
"Another butt enhancer brief that looks a bit unnatural and phony. These truly must be for guys who have absolutely no rear, but if you already have something of a rear and want to give it a bit more, then this is too much!"
I bought this ring for my girlfriend and i was beyond disappointed when it arrived.
"The first one I ordered was broken, so I had to order a second. Second one is not broken, but you get what you pay for (cheap). It worked out great as a raffle item for a fundraiser though."
"the writing is way too small, you need a magnifying glass to read it. I was disappointed and probably won't give it to my daughter."
"This is not the size it's supposed to be, they run like 3 sizes smaller than what it should be"
"The diamond trim (so called BLING) was hastily applied -at a slant- as if it was a 5year old's craft project.
Looks cheap...don't waste your money on this!"
Was a size smaller than tagged.  Swapped for bigger size.  Then strap broke after a month of infrequent use.
"I usually wear an Xtra large, but I like my hoodies big and roomy so not being able to see this one I ordered a 2x. I love the hoodie, it's so soft but it's not a 2x. It's pretty snug on me no room at all. It's more of a Xtra large than 2x. Very disappointed!"
This items did not fit to size.  Which was to bad because it look like it would have been a great wear.
May work for plastic crystals but did nothing to fix scratches on Hardlex mineral crystal on Seiko diver watch despite multiple applications.  It may still work on plastic but don't waste your time with other harder materials.
"unfortunately I will have to return these as they seem to be an inch wider around the calf than the black pair that I bought, that are exactly the same size. It is a shame as they are really nice boots apart from that, but it feels like I'm wearing wide rain boots, with a huge gap around the calf, which does not look good."
These are ridiculously too small. You will need to size up 2 SIZES for these to fit. Total disappointment. Should be labeled as kid sizes.
Very poor quality and it runs large. Not to mention it looks very cheap.  Not a good buy.
The waist band seems to tight and the rest of the shorts big.
The clasp broke within a few hours of putting it on the first time.
"I am now updating this review as I initially thought these would be comfortable, but I wore them a bit more around the house and it actually was so narrow that it caused my ankle to swell and I had to return them. When I tried the wider width, which I never wear, those were too big and too long.

Here's my original review: I hadn't worn I have major challenges trying to find a comfortable tennis shoe as I've had two double foot surgeries and legacies from those, and I almost didn't get these as I prefer a more neutral color, such as white with touches of silver, but I read some reviews in a few places and was glad I tried them. Normally, I wouldn't go straight into a tennis match with brand-new shoes, as I did with these--and they hugged my foot without feeling too tight and I finally, FINALLY could feel some cushioning under my foot, which I've been searching for. I have a rather wide forefoot but a narrow heel, so it's typically difficult to find something that can accommodate both of those issue, but even in the medium width--these did the trick.

Even with the purple touches, they're not too crazy looking and though it definitely didn't match my tennis team's colors--it didn't clash. So happy I tried them, but they do run a bit on the close, snug side!"
all the reviews were correct. i picked the lightest appearing color: buckwheat. it arrived super dark. the color is horrible. it's not even aesthetically pleasing as a dark shawl. buy something else.
Worst boots ever I Ordered multiple pairs for my twins both pairs ripped within the first day manufacturers defect should be taken off the market. Waste of time
The color was very different from what was advertised on the site. Also fit very poorly. Sent back. Quality was very cheap as well.
Doesn't lift but I don't really have a behind anyway
"I got this navel ring because it's cubic zirconia so I hoped it would be more sparkly than the cheaper plastic and glass crystal ones. I really was pleased with it... for 3 days!

After wearing it 3 days, I got in the shower and saw the screw-top ball piece had completely come off and was gone. While wearing it, I didn't go swimming or do any vigorous exercise or anything that could be considered ""user error""  that might cause the top screw on ball to come loose. I also tend to periodically tighten the screw pieces on my navel rings, this one included, but it still came off! I really think it was shoddy quality of the screw on this item because I have a ton of cheapy one dollar navel rings that have lasted me much, much longer!

I know ten dollars for this thing isn't a lot to throw a fit about, but I literally have 99 cent pieces that don't ever come loose- and this one got lost in 3 days!!

I still have the bottom half with the heart gem in it but I just had to replace the top piece with a plain steel ball. The point of getting this was to have a more sparkly piece, but now it's half gone. BOO!"
"I have plantar fasciitis band purchased these in hopes of some relief. However, I am basically crippled by the end of the day when I wear these. The arches are low on these and the straps are loose."
"I RETURNED THIS SHOE BECAUSE IT WHATSOEVER PROVIDED NO SUPPORT TO THE ARCH. I WAS EXPECTING TO USE THEM ON HARDWOOD FLOORS, WHICH ALSO CAME TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THEY SLIDE PRETTY EASILY WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO BALANCE YOUR BODY. SORRY, BUT I WON'T GET THESE. aLSO, THEY LOOK PRETTY IN THE PICTURE THAT IN PERSON."
The two tone wrist band takes everything away from this item. I had to return this item..
Zipper caused a wave in both sizes I purchased...very unfaltering which is sad bc it's a pretty dress
"Had these actually fit as pictured, Id be writing an entirely different review. They are way boxier fitting than on the model in the photo. They are not stylish fitting in the least."
"the ring is beautiful, but poorly made. A stone fell within 2 hours of wearing"
"should be a little bigger in the zipper compartment, very well made and looks great
after using it for 5 months, the credit cards start to slip out and you find them on the floor, the leather stretches too fast."
Dont have any support ...  its a simple walk shoes.. if you need support for hard days get Salomons
"Bought this dress for a photo shoot. I ironed the hell out of it, but couldn't make the wrinkles go away. I had to spend hours in photoshop dealing with the ugly wrinkles. It also wasn't super flattering, it was just okay."
Had to return this. So pretty but was way too small.
the tops don't have elastic stitching and so they don't stretch. I was afraid the sewing stitch would break.  Not a great buy.
Not seeing results 
Bad quality shoe. Sole come off after days of use. 3 pairs i bought all happened the same
Way too bulky sending back
"The insole was pretty hard, which could have been solved with an insert, but not worth the trouble. The upper was very stiff and cheap looking. It actually looked like formed plastic."
"I opened the package and found a stain on the back of the shoulder, and I found a long strand of dark hair on the product. Other than that, the sleeves are extremely large for ""slim fit"" (like, 2 inches of extra material around my biceps)

On the bright side, the shirt didn't come with a strong industrial smell or any extra staining around the rest of the shirt so it'll serve it's purpose. The material feels nice and despite the sleeves, the shirt fits comfortably and a suit jacket will hide any imperfections on it. I'm only using it for special events where I most likely won't be removing the jacket. I'll find a vest later to make it more viable.

The low-star rating is for the stain and hair and the inaccurate title and description stating that this is slimfit. This is just a normal shirt with normal sized sleeves and chest."
"Good for 3 or 4 months.  My son loves the characters, but it doesn't last and after 4 months the zip is not working properly."
"Had to send this back 3 times because of scratches and defects. Would not purchase again. The actually necklace is so cheap, and it would snap or the circles would bend with just a light tug. sent back for a refund thanks to Amazon being such a great place to purchase from."
"These suits run small. I ordered a size up and it was still too tight on the bottoms. The top fit fine, but I felt that if I ordered a larger size for the bottoms the top would be too large. There's better cheap high-waisted bikinis on Amazon."
fits thin. shrunk with a few washes. looks like pants you'd wear to the club and not to work. not my thing.
"This is OK for lite cosplay use, the jacket is REALLY thin, I don't mind having to sow the buttons tighter, but for $45 I was hoping it would be as heavy as a basic zip up, this feels more like bed sheets in the shape of a zip up, but it's a great concept and would have kept if it was in the $20-$30 range"
"This was terrible- cheaply made, way too small."
too big!
"I was really excited to get these leggings, but after 2 hours of wearing them I started noticing holes and poor stitching. I'm really disappointed."
"I was looking forward to this bra when purchased, i thought finally a bra that won't pinch and or poke me.  I wore this bra for one day and i spent the entire day at work adjusting my bra under my clothes.  i was quite disappointed."
Disappointed.. Looks cheap... and the strap broke after a couple of weeks... do not recommend
I took them out of the package. Unfolded them gave them a good long look and back in the package they went. Do yourself a favor go to the  mall.
Pretty belt but I had to glue it twice.
I looked like MC Hammer in these
Cheap  cheap  not worth 5 dollars MUCH less 14
I don't remember reading that these were for a child when I purchased them. the purple eye glass part doesnt even cover the eye ball part of an adult! The top of the frame rests on the top of my eyeball when I tried these on. Very poor design.
"if you carry any sharp object in your pocket such as a car key, it will eventually make a hole ..very quickly. I bought 3 pairs and in a matter a days , one hole appeared around the front pocket. Was very bizarre... I guess the material is pretty flimsy ."
"chain not long enough since the clips do not fit on the end threads. you would have to remove each time you wear the bracelet, and i have narrow wrists. looked good. returned."
"I always used Huggies pull ups but bought pampers easy ups this time around expecting it to be similar... Couldn't be more wrong. Easy ups are bulkyyyy and hard. Huggies pull ups were way softer and not bulky, but still absorbent enough"
"Leather was not thin enough. I love the look of leather, and was thinking a leather NATO would be great. I see it fit quite a few watch heads. I bought this for a citizen echo, and it would not fit. I scratched the leather up real bad trying to get it on, so I don't want to return it.

Pictures to see damage, and picture of my citizen echo I got it for.

I have decided to try one more band, because this watch looks great with leather."
its plastic.... you get what you pay for. but its a cute gift
Very long and you need to size up a size.
"What is going on here I have worn this sock for years and these are so tight I can't wear them , Amazon doesn't Carey"
arrived all tangled before I even took it out of the box
Does not look like the picture at all. Looks cheap in person!
material is like those thin plastic dinner table covers
"Have you ever read an anecdote about people messing up their backs or knees by wearing cheap shoes? Yeah, these are the shoes they were talking about.

I bought these and another pair of Franklin & Freeman shoes for under $25 per pair. They fit very well with minimal break in. The leather is the lowest quality of corrected grain, but they look nice enough when new. They don't age as poorly as other dirt cheap shoes either. But the soles - oh the soles! - are the absolute worst. They started off reasonably comfortable, but the pain came-a-creepin'. They just get progressively worse, and I'm ninety percent sure they are directly responsible for recent leg, knee and foot pain. I can't PROVE it, dammit, but I'm trusting my gut feeling on this.

Like I said, I paid under $25 for these; if I would have paid $100 or more for these doorstops, like, I totally would have been, like... way more mad or whatever."
"These are just meh. They tend to roll up and once they have started rolling up, you will spend the entire evening fiddling with them to get them to stay flat. (They won't). I usually end up just wearing one, which still stops the ""chub run""."
I've been wearing this size & style of Levis for years.  The material was unusually thin for this style & the crotch was made for a Castrati.  Are these irregulars?
Just way to small for purchasing my regular shoe size. Bummed cuz they are very cute but back they went
It wasn't what I expected and I was so unhappy with it I have returned it.  It certainly doesn't do what they claim it does.
I was so disappointed with these!  They are super cute and I really wanted them to work out but they actually hurt to wear!  I ordered larger to accomodate my orthotic inserts and the size was right but the shoe just didn't give any. It was so stiff that my feet hurt after wearing them. I returned them.
"The neck would choke anyone if they actually buttoned it so the shape and drape are already terrible.

Large size guys need to get an extra large, as is normal now unless you like your stuff super tight.

And the fabric blows.

I like the stitching though."
I had to return them as they are listed as EE width but they were too tight through the toe and ball of my foot.
It's made of very cheap material...  It's so easy to poke your finger straight through the material.  I'm not impressed at all and would have paid $5 for this. it was very disappointing when we got it.
Am a XL and I order it that size. But it didn't even fit me right. Way too small. NOT WORTH IT
I returned it as the design stops in a weird way it doesn't look like the photo when you see it in person
"These were okay... seem like good material but they were so long I could wear them as a dress. I'm 5'5"", US small, and a 36B and they weren't as tight as a normal small tank top, I had a lot of extra shirt all around especially in length.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend this unless someone was looking for an extremely long tank top... I turned around and bought 2 tank tops from maurices without the ""shelf bra"" and they were normal length and perfect fit.
Depends on what you are looking for I suppose."
"Like many of you, I was enticed by the low price. One of the worst decisions I've ever made when it comes to shoes. I have owned a few pairs of Fila shoes in the past and they were good. The quality has gone downhill since they were bought by their Korean licensee. I bought these four months ago at Kohl's. They never were very comfortable. Cheap padding, no arch support and narrow in the toe box. Also, the soles are coming apart. From now on, I'm sticking with Reebok and New Balance. The Reeboks I ordered online should be arriving today."
you will need a thick slip unless you want everyone to see everything.  Prints are pretty and as described but I could not work with the inmodest fabric. My suggestion to the vendor is to 3-4 ply the current fabric for a better skirt.  This would definitely sell well.
"I would recommend going up 1 size in this bra.  Maybe 2, depending on how ample your milk supply is.  I got rid of the bras I bought because they caused a clogged duct twice, second time resulting in mastitis.  It was also a pain to put on because of the stitching, it made it confusing.  There is also no snap to take your breast out to nurse so you have to either pull your breast out from under the bra our pull it to the side, which puts your breast at a weird angle and the baby may not want to nurse. I really would not recommend."
I loved the boot but the fit was not good
"The design is cute, it fit snugly in my right cartilage piercing. But I don't know if it's nickel or what, but it made my ear break out in bumps. I'm assuming it was an allergic reaction cause when I switched my old back in, the bumps went away."
"The bra is very tight - no give at all when you first put it on.  It made two raw spots on the outside of my breasts on the first day.  I had to wear bandages until my skin healed.  After washing the bra, the support and stiffness is gone.  I will not buy a second one from this company."
Seems very cheap. Don't even like the style now that I see it in person. Very loud ticking that I have to put it in a drawer to sleep at night.
"Beautiful Shoe but came torn , tried to ignore, because sending it back would cist more than the shoe its self,  ended uo taking to a shoe repair paud extra , sad to see low quality shoe"
"Fits perfect , amazing shape and color once I received after less than a year turns out to be rubbish, I tried every thing with it but the upper lost it colors and outsole cut in many places stitches apart.
Not recommended for even short term."
really cheaply mad the costume is for a small child but the wig is huge!!! the crown came broken it was just really cheap and poorly made was disappointed my 4 year old loves monster high
"Did not like shape of this shoe at all. Looks like a witch pointy shoe, just ugly shape sent back."
The watch shipped to me was a women's timepiece and NOT a men's watch.  I am not happy this vendor did what they did and will not use them again.
"I figured these were worth a try, even with all the other bad reviews. I followed the advice of others and ordered a 4t for my 2.5 year old, and they fit ok with a little extra length. I didn't like the tacky rhinestone button, but figured it will be covered so no one will see it. Upon first wear they were fine- thicker than regular  leggings and the waist didn't gap.

Then I washed the navy pair and dried them on low. As you can see in the attached photos of the post-washing navy pair on top of the unwashed pink pair, they are now half the size they were before. I doubt theyll even fit on my child at this point."
First one arrived with a broken strap. The replacement broke within 3 weeks. I have never had this happen before. Do not order this bra.
"I am deeply disappointed to say that the 'new' pair of Clarks Women's Society Gown Ankle Boot,Black Leather,6.5 M US that I purchased from Amazon were damaged. The leather near the toes of the left side has a tiny tear. Upon closer inspection I realized that the heels were partially worn down as well. I have to ship this back from Trinidad, West Indies. I paid freight, duties & taxes. AND I have to pay again to ship back the damaged items. I paid for new shoes... Real new shoes, not the fake 'new' ones I received. Come on Amazon, this should have been sold as a Warehouse Deal, not as a new pair of shoes. I can't recall ever having a problem like this with merchandise sold by Amazon, but I guess there is a first time for everything. Too bad for me.

Now, if not for the fact that I got this disappointingly damaged pair of shoes I would be quite pleased with this purchase. I would have rated them 5 stars. (Fast shipping, nice packaging) Can't do that though, I paid too much for this kind of disappointment.

When I recovered from the horror of seeing that tiny tear on my 'brand new', eagerly anticipated, Comfort Shop, Clarks shoes I somehow still found the courage to try them on. It was just a tiny tear I told myself. The shoes are wayyy down there on the ground, maybe no one will notice. I tried them on.. My feet were nicely cushioned. The fit was a bit close. I bought another pair of this size and brand that was a perfect fit. I think the leather should break in nicely after a day of wear. They look great too. Nice leather (the parts that are not torn). The rubber soles have a nice grip but WAIT... the shoes did not feel completely sturdy. I pulled them off and turned them over. Lo and behold! The outer back corners of the heels on both shoes were worn down. The heels on my 'new' shoes were worn down! They are UNEVEN. Unbelievable. I guess these were previously returned. They didn't come in the usual box with the Clarks logo.

In all honesty, I think a new, undamaged pair of these shoes would be quite comfortable, sturdy and very stylish. I bought them for work but I think they'd be great with my jeans too. I would have loved them."
"Husband tried on same size in store and they fit. These were way to, he only wears Keens but is very disappointed in these."
"Not royal blue,it's navy. The ring itself is constructed well so I'll keep it.."
"Too long and the relaxed fit made them way to big in thigh and butt area. I am returning them. Sadly, there were too few options in sizes."
These earrings look very cheap and the stones seem smaller then the pic. I'm getting a refund and sending them back
"I have been buying reef Classic mens smoothy's for 7yrs & either the quality has tanked & they changed their sizing or these are knock offs. They're at least 1/2"" shorter than the size 10's I have & the tag on the shoe is different. I wrote to Reef. They are looking into the matter. These aren't bad flip flops, they still have some arch support which is why I like Reef's, but these are definitely not the Reef's I'm used to paying $25/pair for"
"cute color combo, but the sizing is super narrow. and they don't make wide. they suggested men's shoe, but the mens does not come in any colors and look like orthopedic shoes on the foot."
"I ordered this swimsuit for my vacation to Jamaica. It did arrive in time for my vacation, however, it was not what I expected. I normally wear a size medium, but I know that swimsuits normally run small, so I ordered a large. When I put on the swimsuit, I could hear the seams rip (even though the swimsuit was a tad bit big on me). There is little to no support in the breasts either."
"They look nice, but my daughter won't use them, she finds them very umcorfortable, in the back and in the front. Bad buy.....  I always thought that Crocs make wide and comfortable shoes...."
"These are just as they look, but the edging around the top is cheaply and inaccurately sewn.  They work fine for low-cut shoes, but I probably wouldn't buy them again"
"Nice shirt but sizing was off, had to give to my kids."
"Clearly this was intended for costume purposes, but the quality looked good and considering the amount it was originally selling for I assumed it'd be a higher quality hat.

It had good reviews and with the discount price I decided to give it a shot.

For costume purposes I suppose it's fine, but it isn't anywhere near the quality I had hoped for. There was a dent in the top I was able to get out, but the brim on the hat is all kinds of eff'ed up. The band on the hat is also sewn on, so forget taking it off.

Wasn't the best purchase I made, not thrilled with the hat."
"Received item 06.03.17. Used it only once weekly for four or five weeks. Screws in handle worked themselves out. Luckily I was able to retrieve them. Metal pin inside shaft came out, could not get back in. Cannot lower handle. Will have to go across town to deliver to a Samsonite drop off point and then pay $10 to send it off to be reviewed whether it's a manufacturing defect. So much for a three year warranty. Certainly cannot claim excessive use! DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
"These Pants seem to run a bit smaller in size. They did seem however to be made of good material but they are high riders and the legs seemed a bit more wide than so called ""straight leg"". I loved the color"
"The size is so so...  It is uncomfortable.
I do not like the style.  ."
"The photo made it look like an interesting fabric . Like the seems were lighter than the rest or something. Its just basic fabric though and its too big. Not sexy at all. It is royal blue and is what I ordered tho, so i won't give it too low of a rating. Order a siZe down!!!"
"pretty but not a long enough band, plus it keeps unlatching."
This was gigantic. It was too large and gaudy. Looked kind of cheap but a friend said she likes it so I gave it to her. Different tastes I guess..
Sent bk --looked cheaply made & accidentally ordered same thing twice -OOPS - sne them both bkCheaply made
I expected the hat to be soft and pliable instead it is as stiff as a board. It appears to have been dipped in a very strong starch or sizing. The end result it is not acceptable to me. I will be returning it.
Fits way too small. Not true to size at all.
It looks and fit nice except they send me the tears swimsuit. I received a defect one!!!
"I have to highly recommend Paloma flats in general.  However, they can be expensive and some of the versions hold up better than others.  I have to specifically recommend against Midnight Garden as the pattern is cracking and they look terrible after just a few months.  I have had many of the others listed here and have had no problem with them.  Watch out for the shiny patterned ones as the material doesn't wear as well as some of the other types.  I wish I could review each version separately but that is not an option on this page.  Also, interestingly - they don't all fit exactly the same.  I am not sure if this is something from shoe to shoe or pattern to pattern yet."
"I sent these back. I did not like them at all. Not that they are bad, they just aren't my taste. I like boots that are comfortable and I think my feet would start hurting right away in these."
Love the material put the necklace in a bit high and tight so I had to return it
Very very very low quality :(
"Great quality, but colors weren't as pictured and my 7 year old is skinny and the 7-8 barely fit. Length is a bit short as well. Size UP!"
"It fits ok. I ordered this one and one from la leche league. The la leche league one fits amazing. Now, I have had it for a couple of months and the fabric tears where the needle went into the fabric to sew the seam. This looks like it got sewed with an old or damaged needle. It's worthless now falling apart like that!"
"You would think I could find SOME redeeming quality about a watch I received from the Amazon seller for FREE. And honestly, if I could think of anything positive to say, I would.  But... I can't.

1. Wrist band is way too big, need to spend money at a jeweler to get it sized.
2. Have no idea what the three small dials are supposed to represent.
3. No instructions or any paperwork at all came with the watch.
4. ""Number 1 gift of 2014""???  Are you serious? I would be really embarrassed to give this watch to anyone as a gift.
5. Seller on Amazon says this watch retails for close to $50 but we Googled the watch, and found it sells elsewhere for $9.

My husband is not interested in wearing this watch at all. It has gone back in the box and will no doubt be donated to Good Will during our next run."
Material shrank and darkened(bought white and dingy now) after first wash. Very short and unable to wear now.
Front is open so be careful.lol.....kinda see through......
"Nice fabric, really cute style and fit very well in the bust and torso but was way too tight for my chubby upper arms. It was like the sleeves were 2 sizes smaller than the rest of the garment. Very awkward fit; I wish Royal Robbins made this in up to an XXL instead of stopping at XL!"
Loved them until they fell apart after about a month
"I like the look and the fit, though these were suppose to be new and they have obvious signs of having been worn.  There was slight (though very small) smudges and wear on the bottom.  There was a scuff on the back of one shoe that was not part of the design. It is fine, not a deal breaker, though I'd not encourage buying from this seller because there's a chance the shoes you order will be even more worn or scuffed than the ones I got."
"Ordered XL, but this wears like a 3XL."
"How ironic--I chose this purse hook because it was cheap, and right after I posted a glowing review the metal hook fractured--even though my bag is neither large nor heavy. I'm back on Amazon looking at other options because purse hooks are immensely handy, but this time I'm looking for reputable sellers who indicate the maximum weight their purse hooks will hold. Lesson learned."
"this is a crap skin-suit.  arms too long, legs too short, fingers all gross... head mask definitely too small.  Sent it back."
Too too small! I'm usually a Small I couldn't get my arms through I wanted to return it and get a credit but I have to pay the return to China!
not for the guy I purchased for.
"Unlike most Sakkas products that I have purchased and loved, this dress was a horrid disappointment. It was HUGE. I am plus sized and 5 foot 8 and this swam on me. Most disappointing, this dress looked NOTHING like the picture. There was no pattern on it. Just some colors like the one in the picture. Returned."
"But once you wash and dry them a few times, they shrink up and become too tight.  I knew this was going to happen when I first tried them on after they were delivered; I should have sent them back for a larger size but I was lazy because of the nice summer weather.

Also these jeans are not nearly as soft and comfortable as the ones I bought at the mall (same brand, size, style, and color). In fact, even the place where they were made was different. I will not buy jeans online again."
"The underwear fits and feels fine, but I do not like the colors that were sent.  I ordered two packages:  one had 6 pairs of white with blue dots; the other had three white/blue dots and three solid black.  I had expected - and wanted - more variety of colors as shown in the photo.  I will not order underwear from Amazon again since the advertised colors DO NOT MATCH the product you actually receive -- that is FALSE ADVERTISING."
"Wouldn't buy, sizes run too small, need to revamp sizing charts."
I found these to be rather tight and uncomfortable. Would not purchase again
"Horrible knock-offs!
I should have known when there was a $120 difference in price, but I only needed them for a one-night special occasion so I went cheap.  Big mistake!  By the end of the evening my feet were in crippling pain!  I could feel every single cleat of the sole pressing through the bottom of my foot.  There is no padding to speak of between the cleats and your foot!  HIGHLY uncomfortable.  I would never buy these.
I reached out to the maker of these more expensive shoes; https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B015ZGMBL4?psc=1&smid=AIEUZANEXEI7Q  They said that the product I purchased is a cheap knock-off that is ruining their brand."
Im really not rough on skate shoes since I don't skate so I was shocked when these started falling apart so quickly especially since I didn't wear them daily. I guess Osiris quality isn't like it used to be they fit like expected and looked just like picture
The seams came undone at the back of the dress after less than an hour of wearing it and I had just arrived at my Ball when I was told that there was a 'hole' in the back of my dress!!!!  I was therefore extremely uncomfortable the whole evening and very disappointed and didn't enjoy myself as I didn't want to move around much as I was worried the seams would come undone even more.  Such a disappointment as it is a gorgeous dress but it gets a one star from me.
This dress does not appear the way it does in picture. It looks like it was purchased at the flea market. It is very large on me on top of that.
way to tight. not much room in them like the zjet
"Shoe fit well to size and looks nice however, my hubby has to have these for work . A cheaper alternative to shoes for crews the soles have already worn flat and have no traction to keep him from slipping and slidi g all around the floors at work. Paid the price and they lasted 2.5 months. Ugh had to toss them and will be buying actuall shoes for crews nexg time."
"I bought both the 3T and 4T for my three year old daughter and they were both huge! I washed the 3T in the hope that I could just stitch up the hem but the waist is stil too huge too so I'm hoping she might grow into it at some point since I can't return it now. (For reference, she usually wears a 3T or 4T depending on the brand of pants)"
this is the first time I have been disappointed with a carhartt product.  Socks are cut low and inconsistent.  Not all of the socks in this pack are the same length. And they droop and slide down the ankle badly
Poor small !!! I ordered a XLg and still too small and very short waisted.
The title says navy blue but will mail you black grain pattern pants. (Came out torn) Thanks to amazon for the refund.
The material wasn't what I expected.
Way too small. Couldn't even get over my head. Material had no stretch to it either
This item was too large for the watch. It didn't fit.
"Bought 2 of these. I replaced their chain with a heavier gold chain and it brought so many compliments. Quite attractive but as far as I can see when battery runs out, thats it. Can find no way to reopen. The info on the watch did not mention this.."
"Very comforable, fits well for median face size, excellent for reading and sun protection - but frame shattered within three months."
"It's very pretty. I am a 36B so I ordered a 36B. However, the bra size is most definitely NOT a 36B. Way too tight! Aside from sizing issue, it is lovely."
"Update after wearing a few weeks:  These shoes are so strange, it is like there is zero support on the sides.  They are comfortable when you first put them on but it is like not having any shoes on at all.  They make my ankles hurt by the end of the day.  I bought them to wear at work where I'm not on my feet a lot and my feet hurt at the end of the day.  I'm so sad, they are beautiful.  Two stars downgraded from 5.  One star for the look of the shoe and one star for the fit.

Previous review:  Love love love these!!  They are my most comfortable Sketchers!  Pretty too!"
WAY too small ... I regret this purchase....
"the pants fit well, but the color is not at all like what is shown in the picture. it is really an ugly green."
"These are very good socks - good fit - good sturdy top - no aggravating seams to rub your feet.
I will give them a five when I have worn and washed them more and see how they last.....

  Downgraded the four to a one on April 2nd.  These socks lasted less than THREE Months
before the heels started to wear out.  Don't waste your money.  I normally buy Fruit of the Loom
and they last at least a year on my work schedule"
"I ordered these boots in solid black. I called Amazon to confirm they were Black, not brown or two toned. After waiting on hold for over 20 mins. the rep assured me they were solid black. I ordered w/ a quicker shipping to get them in time for a trip.
They came in the two-toned brown. I called and wrote Amazon and have not heard a response.

Now I would like to place another order for the Black Boots for my daughter, but I am left w/ the two tone brown.
How can I get a response from Amazon?

The shoes are ok. I paid the full price and the quality is fair. There is not much support in the arch or heel. I was expecting a more sturdy, supportive boot.

Hoping for an Amazon rep to get back to me. It's been over 2 months!"
"First impression was mild disappointment as fabric wasn't as thick and fleecy as described,
but it seemed about right based on price minus shipping cost...buyer beware!
I washed it following instructions precisely before wearing.
Two things occurred: firstly the dryer was full of lint made of the garment's ""fleece"" and secondly, it had shrunk.
Furthermore,  structure of facings were shoddy and I fear repeated snapping and unsnapping will shorten the useful life of robe.
I looked forward to wearing this warm, roomy wrap which now represents a bad buy to me."
"I was so excited to get these and they would be great except for that seam sticking inward like a ""knot""---and I had a thin sock on to try it on.  I am bummed, they have to be returned.  It may be a fluke because the other people say they felt great."
Did d not last past one school term
This thing looks super cheap.
"Very thin lens very large
Will not buy again"
"VERY POOR CONSTRUCTION, with material that is cheap looking"
The color is great but the fit is too large.  Should have ordered a small.
"the shoe was tight, and i didn't think it looked that great (it might just be my feet). i returned them."
"These thermal pants are very soft and very comfortable. Size Medium elastic waistband is a generous 30"" unstretched and fits my 34"" waist comfortably with plenty of room below. Quality is excellent. I returned to stockpile more for next season.

UPDATE 09-17-2013

Sadly, the cotton layer soon pills and is just rubbed away by normal friction with the inner surface of the outer pant legs. Replaced them with these just-as-comfortable longer-wearing thermal pants:

"i received these jeans today and I want you know that they are fake, do not buy , i want my money back, but i can not return i am front dominican republic. i bought size 26."
Arrived with broken chain.
it wasn't the right material that i was hoping for
This shoe is really uncomfortable and totally not what you would expect from this brand being known for their comfort which is real bummer because it is sharp looking but is just totally hard like a rock.
Fail apart the first time I wore it
"I normally wear this size bra 34 D I don't understand why this happened, it's extremely small I am so disappointed.  However the feel of the bra I'd excellent and it was delivered in a timely manner,  hence the reason for 2"
"The packaging was to included skirt,shirt, wig and glasses. The glasses were not in the packaging."
"They are very good-looking boots, but the stiff leather made it uncomfortable to walk. The back of the boot hit my leg with each step, so I would imagine that they would chafe after walking a while. For size reference: I typically take a 6 in no-sock shoes (like flats). I ordered the 6.5 here to accommodate a sock, but they were still too snug. The toe tapers, so if you have that shape foot, you might be okay. I'm usually a M width but border on a wide and these were too tight. I think I'd need a 7 in these."
The second band was too tight and the shoe was slippery- I returned them
"Sadly, finding a comfortable bra for my DDD girls seems to be close to impossible, but after reading so many positive reviews I was hopeful, and decided I'd give this bra a try.  There is NO support, bad band roll, and there's a creeping constant ride-up in the back. This is definitely NOT good for the larger girls! Thank goodness for Amazon's free return shipping because I'll be sending this one back asap!!!"
"Not what I expected, ended up purchasing a different belt altogether."
"Bought this watch as a graduation present for my grandson.  It was everything he wanted; analog, chronograph, calendar, and BLACK.  That was important.  He wanted a black with silver watch.  Within six weeks of receiving the gift, the black plating on the watch band started wearing off on the outside.  Now, some 10 weeks into the wear, the plating on the inside of the band is coming off on his wrist.  That's how I know the band is brass.  He loves the watch.  He does not like the brass.  Very, very disappointing!"
"I have for many years used exclusively Carhartt 34"" waist garments for my business uniforms consisting of relaxed fit carpenter jeans and the washed duck shorts I live in although I prefer the weathered duck shorts but carhart discontinued them last year, big mistake. I just reordered 2 new jeans along with 2 pairs of these shorts instead of the washed duck that I'm currently using again, all 34"". The jeans fit as expected while the shorts are at least 2 sizes too small. I had this same thing happen once before maybe 2 years ago. Sent them back as these are going back also. Carhartt's quality control has definitely gone down in the past few years probably due to out-sourcing to china and mexico. I'll be changing manufactures for sure maybe try Duluth Trading co. and can never go wrong with a good-ole pair of levi's"
I loved it at first.. until it was washed.. then all the stars washed out.. it does not even look like the same outfit.. very disappointed.
"Overpriced compared to suits purchased at Walmart, and colors faded fast."
"The pair of jeans we received were several shades lighter than shown here, and the cut was more of a bell bottom.  We also ordered ""Levi's Little Girls' Taylor Thick-Stitch Jean"" - in the Color ""BLUE WONDER"" - which from the description, I thought would be similar to these, but those are perfect, and these are some weird light colored bell bottom crazy hippie jeans. Which, maybe you will like. For me though, I was interested in a darker wash/slight flare as the picture suggested. My daughter is way to active to have a floppy bell bottom pant opening."
Not really as expected. My little sister likes it tho
"It's not that its not a ""nice Jacket"", but they run Small I ordered a large and needed an XL or 2X
Also the Button is already coming off because it was only sewed on by 1 stich."
"I don't understand many positive reviews here. It doesn't stretch much so compression is too much. It has same cheap constructions and materials as many local store socks in terms of physical characters. Good socks comfortably hug my feet, but I have to squeeze my feet in to Carhartt. On and off is tough as well."
These are not skinny they look like parachute pants.
it is so confusing how to figure out the right size to get. the quality is good this is the second time I purchased rose lady since I like the quality of the first one even it is too tight and bites. I tried to ordered again and made sure to get size bigger. unfortunately it was too big this time trying to follow the chart. just a waste of money
I expected a different/fit and quality from Adidas. I workout every day and find these types of underwear very necessary. Just not these. :(
"Stopped working after 3 months..........I brought to watch repair thinking it was just the battery and the jeweler said the mechanisms inside were not of good quality and would cost me too much to fix...........so, it went into the garbage can!"
My wife says that I am never allowed to buy anythclothing product for her again
"I have always loved my Baggallini purses and totes, but this was one I had to send back.
The material (color: Black Cheetah) did not feel as heavy and durable as my other Baggallinis.
And despite the measurements, the interior seemed smaller than I thought it would be.  But the worst thing about this purse is the strap.  It seemed to twist around and tangle each time I picked up the purse.  Very frustrating.  Also the strap material is very slick, so that it kept slipping off my shoulder.  I wish that Baggallini would come back with the quality and design they did so well...."
"I thought this belt was awful. It has a very strong odor, looks like plastic, and there is no way any part of that buckle is Sterling or any other type of silver. It's very thick and heavy and hard, all traits of a metal and none of silver. I returned it immediately. Something K-Mart would carry. Awful."
"The suitcase was very attractive and it looked strong, unfortunately it was half destroyed on my first trip. The bottom fell apart (hard plastic)."
The issue is quality not the name.  This hangs and feels like someone tailored a shirt for an imaginary man and had the proportions all wrong.
This watch has scratch right in the center!!!
Really small for a sarong in my opinion
More of a mint green then a light blue
Hello hello this s*** runs on the rest of your clothes if washed together. DON'T BUY!!!!!
just okay wasn't what I expected.
Way too small. WAYYY darker than pictured
I used it once and the screw mechanism no longer works. I would advise not buying this product. there must be others out there that are better.
took forever to arrive and doesn't look as smart as in picture
"About the only good thing I can say about this cover up is the color is nice. Too short, too wide, wrinkles LIKE CRAZY, doesn't hang right and just looks sloppy. Going to give it away or recycle it. Yuck!"
"These do not stay in place whatsoever. As soon as I put them on, they ride up."
"Returned.  Did not fit, did not like the product at all when I received it"
Bought two pair of these. The knee wore out of one the third time she wore them & she's not rough on her clothes!
Did not fit my ears. Its small and not shiny. You get what you pay for.
"These too are not even for a cjmhikd to wear
VERY DISAPPOINTED"
Nice quality but unbelievably small. I ordered these for my husband (he wears a size and 10.5) and there was no way they would fit. He gave them to me and they fit perfectly (I were a size 8).
"Bought these, because the price and color were right. They seemed to run small and were extremely uncomfortable. I placed them in the next clothing donation."
"The shoe came as pictured, however, the material is extremely hard and rough. The sole is not comfortable, the front of the shoe is not appealing, makes ur foot look wide and big and it runs a/b 1/2 a size larger.  I am returning the shoe ASAP."
they hurt in the back of my foot.
Very small. Didn't fit any of my bridesmaids and the clasp broke as soon as one of the girls tried it on. Wouldn't recommend.
"I am disappointed with this purchase for two reasons. 1) I bought these flats a full size larger & they are still too tight.  2) The color is really unattractive.  I purchased the dusty rose color - it looks like the best choice out of the limited colors.  In person though, it is darker and bland.  It reminds me of the mauve color that a lot of hospitals use for their plastic products.  Ugly."
Nice for a child but not a man
"Ring is a bit oversized , stone is a bit bulky"
and right shoe was looser than the left. NO COMPENSATION. I was just stuck with this pair of crap shoes and they were expensive and to top it off a gift from my son !!  sour taste still in my mouth from this one !!! STILL !!!
"Great ankle support for people with a weak ankle. Keeps your ankle straight and prevents from twisting. Great ankle support.

Update: Bought these shoes for my daughter on December 2015 and its now April 2017. The shoes sole has come loose in the front of both shoes. My daughter is in 5th grade elementary and I bought these for the ankle support, because she kept twisting her ankle. She does have personal fitness and life skills, which the shoe is put to the test. I am surprise to say the shoe has worn very quickly, compare to other shoes she has had.

If you are only going to use them for weight lifting, squads and not to heavy use...Then they are good."
Too Loose fit
"The size waist wise was perfect. But the length, terrible. They shrank immediately to such a degree I can call them capri pants now. I bought 2 of these pants and both did the same thing. I am 5'8"" so I guess I will have to buy a tall size to account for shrinking issues. Bummer."
Fall a part after 3 weeks and Amazon does not accept returns.
Enormous.
"The material these shoes are made of is a very thin, almost-paper-like, mesh.  The only insole is a super-thin, plastic-coated, stiff flat foam with no support or contour whatsoever.  So not only is there absolutely no support, but every time you take a step in these, your feet slide from side to side and since the shoes are just made of extremely thin mesh, there is nothing to keep your foot stable at all.  So you feel like you're walking on the side of the flat foam ""insole"" insert.  They're not even a true purple.  They're basically indigo blue.  I should have sent them back, but like an idiot, I threw the packaging away so I'm stuck with them.  TOTAL waste of money.  They're not worth anywhere near $60.  You'd be better off buying a pair of $10 sneakers at Walmart.  The most I'll be using these for is to putter around the house and maybe the occasional very quick trip to the post office.  Very, very disappointing and certainly not typical Reebok quality."
"My cousin and I each bought one and they broke after only wearing once. They are not high quality!! Yes, they are super cute, but the leather bands snap."
"Ok so I was very excited about receiving these. However, after I put them on and tried walking on them i felt that lack of arch support everyone was talking about. I tried putting in some of my insoles and they still felt uncomfortable. They also are hard to put on and take off. They are cute and whatnot, but definitely not for me."
Came in quickly but was too large
Nice looking shoe bit cheaply made. Fit is good but my first time wearing them the wedge heel broke loose from the entire shoe. Now I need to see it local shoe repair can fix them. Expected better quality.
I didn't love this sweatshirt. I bought it a bit larger based on the reviews. I ended up donating it after like 3 wears.
The dickey was made with very flimsy fabric and was way too expensive considering how thin the fabric felt.  It definitely was not worth the price charged so I returned it for a refund.  I would not buy it again.
"I have many different styles of fitflops; I love them and the support. The fit was large for this pair and the quality of the upper leather was more like cheap plastic. Very uncomfortable. I returned this pair. However, I did order a pair in a tan leather and decided to keep them to work in the yard. The arch is high and supportive and, since they are cheap, hose off like flip flops. Spend the extra money and buy a pair of fitflops that are made with a high grade leather."
Not true to size runs small. I purchased my original size that i always use and it did not fit.no support what so ever.
"Ordered 1X in the navy/ grey and while the fabric is OK the construction is deplorable. Bought it as a knock-around on weekends shirt but it fell short on almost every point. One sleeve is longer than the other, the grey is much darker than shown and construction much more like a sweatshirt. Neckline isn't quite cut like shown on the model and it seems to be very narrow for a 1X size.  Band around the bottom is NOT like a tunic top but really much more like a cheap sweatshirt would be.  I regret the purchase and will probably never wear"
Nice design but poor quality. One bud died after a week.  Tinny sound quality.
toooooo large
The display isn't blue! Hard to read. Very disappointed.
"These shoes were very pretty to look at, but designed in a way that they simultaneously pinched and flopped.  How is that even possible?  Lol"
"Fabric tore at the outside forefoot area within 2 months of moderate use. New Balance placed a reinforcement here to prevent this (presumably), but the fabric finds another place to tear since the reinforcement makes the fabric forward of it flex.

Sole wears fine, as far as these things go.

Worn without socks, the fabric can be irritating if the edge of the tongue is not flat, since this edge is rough. The fabric is synthetic and not soft on the skin. The tongue also slips to the side if not tied tightly.

Structure is good and the build of the upper is even generally fine. The marterial, however, is a poor choice and causes problems with the shoe over time -- an unfortunately short amount of time."
"It says that it is for a 12-18 months but it did not fit me 18 months that is a tiny one. He is only 10 kg-22 pounds.
I bought another brand before that was much better. Should have stick to the tolher brand."
I am a 36-D and these didn't even cut it.
"I guess I'll have to buy 1 size larger, which will probably be too large"
You get what you pay for.......way too thin to be 501s
"Cheap and incredibly off in sizing! The 10/12 is more like a 6x and the 14 is more like an 8/10. Also it fits like biker shorts, not board shorts."
The elastic on the bottom broke after one month of wear.
looks very cheap!
Very good looking but not worth the high price charged and the necklace is shorter than shown. Also can not be transferred over to another necklace easily because of the lack of hardware.
All the reviews were way off. I'm 5 foot 4 and 145 pounds I got a medium it's more like a zero. It was made terrible absolutely horrible it was suppose to be for my birthday and it's ugly. The seams weren't even finished it was very very very cheaply made like 2 dollar worth.
This will cut your skin! AVOID!!!
"I was really hopeful to get this item. I ordered a larger size considering other reviews. However, once I tried it on I realized the sleeves are more like regular sleeves and not the kimono style I was expecting. On me the sleeves fit pretty tight and I was hoping for a open draped feel. Also, the stitching is not straight in some areas and the material seems pretty flimsy. I didn't expect it to be totally high qual considering the price I paid, but it has that feel that if it gets caught on anything, it'll rip easily. I plan to return it back mainly because of the fit. I also ordered the ivory version of this product, but surprisingly the fit, feel, and overall quality of that one is better. I've decided to keep that one."
"IT WAS NOT BIG ,I NEED 8""  THEY SAY IT WAS BIG IT WAS NOT,BUT  I WILL KEEP IT  MEN NEED A BIG BRACELETS."
Returned them...
"I ordered and expected ""Original fit"". I got ""skinny jeans"" instead. I am a 50 year old man wearing skinny jeans and looking like a retard now.  Thanks alot, NOT"
"Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base is a product that is touted to ensure that makeup goes on smoothly, will protect skin with moisture, and reduce the appearance of fine lines.

Using the product, I tried differing application methods:
Over slightly moist skin
Over patted dry skin

Application method:
Small amount gently applied
Small amount gently worked into the skin til almost absorption
More generous application in problem areas

Followed by:
Moisturizer
No Moisturizer

Followed by:
Regular foundation
Oil free foundation

Followed by:
Light dusting of mineral based powder

In every method:
There was no pore refinement, nor reduction in the appearance of fine lines
My makeup did not set in the light coverage I strive for
Moisturized initially, but did not seem to be as good as my other products (tried on neck area for this assessment)

While this product did not irritate my skin, I found no benefit for this pricey offering."
"Even though I measured my sons foot and bought according to the sizing chart, they were to big."
"Title pretty much says it all.  I LOVED this necklace the first time I wore it.  Went to wear it a second time and when I picked it up, it broke with pearls going all over the place.  So disappointed...was very pretty just too bad it didn't last."
does not do the job intended. too small and light to strech shoes
It states would fit . It was smaller them expected
Toe box is too narrow for a steel toed boot in 11D. I could feel the steel toe rubbing on both sides of my foot. Returned.
"The fit is HORRIBLE! super uncomfortable, I couldn't give two steps! the front of the boots lifts off the ground so you don't have a good balance while wearing them. I love the way they look, wish they were made for walking. haha see what I did there?"
"The photo showed the clasp and frame to be in silver metal, when it arrived it was gold, and looked really ""off"".
A stone was missing, and 6 others were loose.  I am returning this one while keeping the one I bought in white.  I purchased the last 2 in black in case the first I got was a mistake.  If they are the same as the first, they will also go back!"
I returned the pants.  They were several sizes too small.  It's ridiculous to sell a garment that is so incrrectly sized.  Both Amazon and the manufacturer should be ashamed.
Well... it looks cheap...
"Too small to put things into, if you put something big it will get bulky and not close."
Picture looks like the ring would be  really awesome it's pretty cheap and crappy looking in person
"A lot of people seem to have had success with this dress, and unfortunately I did not. I have a vintage event coming up, and amid the $80 to $100 price tags for very nice vintage clothing, I was hoping this dress would do the job based on the other reviews.

I am 5' 2"", 125 pounds, with an hour glass figure, and D cups. I was really surprised how this didn't fit me very well, despite all of the rave reviews. I can't wear a strapless bra with it, as it sits far too low on my back. So, I'm not getting any good cleavage out of the dress, along with the neck-line being too high to show much of anything without there being support, which is frustrating if you want to show some cleavage off.

As a shorter-than-average person, the dress is incredibly long, almost down to my ankles. I understand this is the style, because it's a vintage dress, but it's just slightly too long for me. ""Well why can't you get it hemmed?"" I can already hear people saying, but if there's one thing I hate, it's having to spend more money on something I just spent money on (the trials and tribulations of being juuuuuust a couple inches too short for most pants and dresses). I might as well go out and buy a more expensive dress for better quality fabric than take the time and money to find someone to hem it.

Lastly in the back of the dress, is a panel of stretchy material - as in there's no zipper. For me it totally destroyed the ""vintageness"" of the dress. It makes me feel like I'm wearing a beach dress (you know, the beach dresses with the bunched up sections of elastic that make it easy to throw on.). It's also part of the reason why it doesn't sit right on me - the stretchy fabric makes it too loose so it moves around a lot. That's not a great feeling when you can't wear a bra with it. I suppose that's what I get for going for a cheaper dress. A zipper would've totally made this dress better in my opinion. It would've been snugger and just overall would have been a little classier.

For pros, I will say the color of the dress is nice. It's a pretty, vibrant blue. I'm not a huge fan of the material, but the price point was fantastic, which is why I went for the dress in the first place. Despite my issues with it, a lot of people seem to really like the dress and who knows, it might fit you better than it did me."
"I purchased this for daughter gym bag at Xmas, its now end of March and it is toast. The cords just broke while she was at school. Cute bag but poorly made"
"kept falling off in water, cute but cheapy"
Not worth it . Went flat in less than a week of use.. plus very very sliplery ! I fell 3 times and the 3rd time they went straight to the trash.
Nothing special about this shirt.  Not flattering at all.
"Thin, flimsy material. Clearly made to only be worn once. Do not buy this as an addition to a costume collection."
"Heavy, runs big, wasn't flattering on me"
"Just very 'chincy', threw away after 1 month"
"This shoe didn't fit right at all, especially in the heel.  I exchanged it for another Ecco style."
I was excited to put this in my hospital bag I'm packing but one of the snaps doesn't work. It's too close to my due date so I don't think I'll send it back but I'm really bummed the snap doesn't snap in properly.
"Actually the shoe is nicely constructed, but unfortunately does not come in narrow widths so they just flop around on me, even though I put an insert and socks on.
I have them, and will keep them until i run into someone I think can benefit from them."
"Received tarnished necklace. Barely looked silver at all. No "".925"" stamp to verify quality. Started return process the same day it arrived. Be prepared to return in case you get one from the lower quality batch for easier returns our replacements. It appears this has happened to several people. You might get a good one, just be aware that their quality is not consistent.
Very glad I didn't try to give it as a gift before looking at it. Included a photo."
"Super loose, and my boobs are spilling out (34D). Pretty s***ty quality, zero support fyi."
"The boots are great.  Adorable, fit well.  I had/still have an issue with my invoice.  It has been over a month and I still cannot get a hold of anyone at Icon to respond.
To say that Icon's customer service stinks might be incorrect.  The truth is, you simply CANNOT get a hold of their customer service.  I tried their email address AND have left a voice mail.  Nada."
After 2 washes it fades
"I usually wear a 7.5 shoe but this one was a bit large in the heel and it was tight across the top of my foot, unfortunately I had to return them."
Decided to keep da shirt. My wife loves it!!
Thin and flimsy - bent out of shape hours after I put it on- save your money!
only works if you have the PICTURED boobs...:( or perfectly gravityless world~~?
"i initially received a defective and NON WORKING  watch. I contacted the merchant, sent  pics to prove to them that the watch wasn't working!!!!! They agreed to send another watch, but Til now ( over 3 months later) we have  the replacement!!!"
"Runs big and the material feels too thin, I don't think it will last like my older night wears"
"First of all, I must say they are my favorite jeans. Super soft and fit just perfect. Love them.
But now, after 4 months, the knee-part ripped and I have a big hole in my jeans now. I did wear them once a week, maybe 2 times and in my opinion they should last a little bit longer than 4 months.
Not worth the money."
Material is thin. I'm 5'2 100 pounds. The top part is to big. There is a bulge when I zip up the dress. It is very awkward. No stretch.
"I am 5'9', 147 lbs, 37B; I ordered a large.
The sleeves are nice, but the actual dress itself felt really cheap. The dress material felt like cardboard.
It fit well, but the boat neck was not a good look for me; it was just too wide. Maybe if my shoulders weren't quite as broad, it would've worked better."
Cute but even a size larger than my usual is too small.
"Poor quality - not very sturdy, durable"
Smaller than expected . Super long arrival time
Very small. Doesn't stretch.
Ordered this dress two or three times and each time it was assembled incorrectly. Middle seam is supposed to be in the back! Got it in purple (put together properly) and I love it! Still was bummed because I wanted red for Valentines Day!
The ear cuff is so nice except for the broken off post. I was so disappointed when I opened the box the cuff came in to see the post broken off and there is no way to fix this piece so yes technically  brought a useless piece. Though shipping was fast that's about the only good part about this whole experience. I give this a 0 out of 10 and most likely will not be dealing with this company again.
"They're cute, but poorly designed. Wouldn't fit my daughter's feet (they were too big as far as length, etc.) because the elastic does not stretch enough to get her chubby baby feet into the shoe. She's average weight and has normal, chubby feet (as the majority of babies do), so I'm not sure how anyone would get normal baby feet into the shoes without cutting them or altering them somehow. We weren't able to use them at all, waste of money for us and they weren't cheap for baby shoes! Unless your child has REALLY skinny feet, don't buy these!"
"After all the reviews about the size on small side, I ordered ""Large/3 years"" for my 21 months-old daughter (length at 75% and weight at 50%) on 3/10 and received it on 4/03. Even though it was quicker than expected delivery date, it is way TOO small/short. The lace part just right around her belly bottom and it's too tight around her chest and sleeves.
Obviously the company doesn't think about to improve the size after so many negative reviews on the size. Perhaps its target market is Asia."
The fabric on this shirt was too thin for me.  I have had this problem with other Lucky Brand shirts.  It's a shame because it's a beautiful shirt.  Returned it.
sooooo smallllll!  worthless
"My 8 year old son begged for Heelys until he had to wear them.  It takes practice to maneuver and the shoes are not as comfortable as a ""shoe"" as he had hoped.  The shoe seemed to run small, although not too narrow."
Got the 80 cm size for my 8 month old and its huge!  Would probably fit a 2 year old.
The style/ material in the picture is very desceiving. The shirt is extremely wrinkly and WAY to large. Kept only because it isn't worth the time/money to return. First amazon purchase I wasn't happy with.
"The watch was not as expected, I thought it was regular gold, but it is rose gold, and I'm not a big fan of rose gold. It's ok, looks a little cheap to me compared to other Michael Kors watches that I own. I was expecting more."
The material was very sturdy and loved the design but after one long travel from Dallas to U.K. the cover had several puncture marks/tears in it.  So mine did not hold up during my first travel.
poor quality. Rough cotton.
"Cheaply made, bad fit"
Material is not good..stiches started to come off after 2 wear
I would have given these boots 5 stars if the toggles didn't fall off within a week of very light use.
"WAS TOO LAZY TO RETURN IT, BUT WILL NOT BUY AGAIN."
"I like the idea of this product, but they weren't as well fitting or convenient as I'd imagined. I measured beforehand and ordered the appropriate size, but they were too big and kept slipping. Maybe order a size down? Will be returning."
These are small!! Nothing like the size shown on the compare photo to a womans head..
Item was as described and fit perfectly only thing I did not like the picture shows that the pants comes with a belt but no belt came with the pants
they sent me the wrong size and no paperwork to be able to send them back. I wear a 7-7.5 I was going to order an 8 but with so many comments that they run really big I ordered a 7 unfortunately they sent a 6. My foot does fit in it but with no socks and my toes are squished. As for the calves. I have had issues in the past getting boots to fit because my calves are muscular. These boots fit and I can still adjust them out more if I need to. They would be perfect (the reason for 2 stars))if they would have sent me the correct size.
"WAY too short to be a dress.  This doesn't even cover my tush and I am 5'8"" (like the model pictured) I wear a size 4-6 so based on the description I expected it to be short.... JUST NOT QUITE THIS SHORT.  No way I could wear this without leggings."
"Way too small in the calves, more tight than is reasonable to achieve the style of the jogger sweats. Too bad because the color was nice."
Anyone expecting a one piece will be EXTREMELY disappointed!!! It's two pieces and not at all attractive!! The bottoms are cute but VERY little coverage to the point of being a thong. The top doesn't look anything like the pic. I'm a medium and went a size up based on the reviews. I will say that the material is decent but that's my only positive!!!. This is the second suit I've ordered from this seller and I've been unhappy with both. Won't do it again and wouldn't recommend them ever :(
"I've had this wallet for several weeks. Now, I'm an auto tech, and stuff like this tends to take a licking from me. But this wallet is already showing signs of wear. It is an attractive wallet, but all the corners are already chafed. There is also an imprint of my credit card in the leather where it contacts the wallet. It's not very durable, and I'll probably replace it within the year."
"Love the look! Great shoe to transition to fall. However I had to wear them once to find out the zipper at heel  did not work for me. I wore them three times with heel taped up so heel wouldn't bleed. Possibly needed to break them in. I am a teacher so on my feet all day. They are comfortable now, but be prepared to work them in."
"This dress is made very badly.  The front is not stitched to the lining so the lining pulls up and out in the front of the dress.  I am a seamstress so I fixed that.  The back is way longer than the front so the ruffle hangs down and looks like a mistake.  Should have been straight all the way around, which I did to mine.  I also had to take up the seams on both sides substantially to get a descent fit.  I buy a lot of Jones New York, but I cannot recommend this unless you are prepared to remake it yourself of have it remade.  Just buy a different dress."
Problem we are having with the stretch jeans is that the fabric by the zipper splits way before the jeans are worn out in anyway !! 3 pairs now that are ruined in a few months .. They are NOT tight and there is no excuse for this . We have wasted over $100. We will not be buying these again .. Back to regular jeans .I just don't think they are made like they used to be....
Cheaply made.  Would not recommend this product.
I did not realize that the jacket portion was actually sewed as part of the top. I would be ok with even a fake jacket that was sewed into the sides but still came around front like a real jacket but this is completely sewed into the dress and looks silly. I will not be wearing this and since I would probably have to pay to ship it back internationally I cant return it. I have had fairly good luck with items I have bought from overseas but this is definitely my worst purchase so far.
Terrible cut and fit
"Pretty necklace however, I order two and one of them was broken in half."
"Ok so I am 5'4 about 190lbs. I usually wear US women's size 10-12 and am 36DD. I usually buy large or XL swim suits but I got 2XL of this and it was so small! My boobs were pooped out and the bottoms barely went over my butt. Not high waisted at all...too embarrassed to even post a pic. Not even bothering to buy a bigger size. And the straps things on the bottom, nothing like pictured."
"Cute dress, but it was wet when I received it. Pretty sheer too - I returned it."
Cute but back stramps didn't fit my foot!  I had to return them!
It broke after one week......... do not waste your money!
"I'm always hesitant to order things that don't have any reviews, but in this case I'm so glad I decided to take the chance! I live in slippers like these so whenever I see a good deal on a decent looking pair, I try to pick them up. When I saw the $16 sale price on these, I was worried the quality would be lacking. Boy was I wrong! They are beautiful and very well made. I love the navy color and there's a generous amount of fur inside, making them extremely comfortable. They do seem to run a little large, I typically wear a size 11 and the size 10 fits perfect.. I'm telling you, you don't want to miss out on these gorgeous slippers at this fabulous price! You cant get junk slippers at walmart for this price! I've already ordered a back up pair and if they're still on sale next week when we get paid, I'll be ordering a few more.. *EDIT* That was my original review of these slippers. I initially gave them a 5 star rating and I absolutely loved them. They are beautiful slippers, they don't stretch out too bad and the tops of the shoes didn't become stained & dirty looking like these types of shoes often do. However, after about a month of wear, the bottom of the shoe has split from the top, causing a big hole and making them unusable. I purchased 2 backup pairs but considering how long the first pair lasted, I don't have high hopes for them.. I am totally disappointed and upset. I thought I'd finally found a quality pair of slippers that didn't cost a fortune, but unfortunately I was wrong. I guess in some instances you really get what you pay for."
"This product was very disappointing. I was excited to get it because I have square shoulders and no waist, I was looking for something to make me look a bit more shapely. Well first off I have to say, WASH BEFORE WEARING!! This thing is so incredibly filthy, it turned the water brown. It took three rinses before the water ran clear after I washed it. Secondly, while it did fit snug and was s bit uncomfortable to wear, it actually INCREASED my waist size, by about 2 inches. I put it on and thought it made me look bigger, at first I convinced myself that I simply wasn't used to seeing myself with a more proportional figure, but when I went to put on clothes, I couldn't ignore how large it made me look and feel, so I grabbed my tape measure and the numbers don't lie.

At any rate, I did give it two stars because it does at least compress my ribs which flare out at the bottom causing me to lose shape, so I will see how wearing this to the gym works. Maybe as I tone up a bit more and lose fat it will have more benefits."
Poorly made. You can see the glue where the sole meets the shoe. Material is cheap and there's little to no arch.
"While we loved the pants, a true slim fit perfect for my skinny little boy- they do not hold up well.  After 1 washing the fabric is pilling!  Disappointed in the quality."
Not set like shown in the picture
MAKES SKIRTS AND DRESS  LOOL TOO  BIG AND STICKS TO MATERIA SO THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP PULLING YOUR SKIRT DOWN BOUGHT 4 UNTIL  FANCYQUBE SENT ME A CRINOTLIN BY INSTADE OF MY SKIRT WILL GET MORE OF THEM IF I CAN FIND THEM
"I really like these, but they develop holes quite soon. I guess they're good if you don't mind some sewing."
"I made the mistake of not returning this jacket, there are feathers in my house, my car and at work, they pop out and looks TERRIBLE!!!"
We returned this pair because the color was far more khaki than cream colored; this photo does NOT picture what we received. My husband did not like the pattern on the fabric either. Apparently Dockers does not make a light color in D1 Slim fit like the pants in the photo. We are disappointed in Dockers Slim Fit color options; we can no longer purchase a light pair of pants.
"Way too small, should've listened to other reviewers. Also, the coat zipper broke the same day we got the coat. Highly disappointed and wish I could return it."
"I never wore the shoes as I could not even get them on my feet.  I have 5 pairs of Fit Flops sandals and was so hoping the tennis sneakers would be as great as they are, but sadly no."
"Too wide for any of my pants loops and I swear I clicked on black, but I got maroon. Maybe I messed up!"
"The material is a little siff compared to the other sleeping bras I have, but the worst thing is that this bra fits super small. I a 5'4"" and 130 lbs and I ordered a large just to be comfy but it was super tight! Very short too so the straps dug into my shoulders. Would only recommend this for super short people I guess..."
"Looked great, but was way too small. I broke it while putting it on. It was a waste of $12.00, but I should have read more of the reviews from others. "
the skirt was for a kids size- the socks were ripped not excited but i made it work - not worth it-skirt wasn't full like it looks like-
Ordered two pair.  Black and beige.  Received the beige but the second item was Doll shoes for an American girl doll.  Not even close
These were too small and I did not get to wear them
"Yes, you can get a few cards into this thing but dollar bills need to be folded twice to fit the compartments.  A feww bills folded as required overloads the capacity and it ""pops"" open in your pocket.  don't get it as a wallet."
the color is nice but could not walk because the golden fabric is very loose and does not fit the foot.
"Bought a matching set in green.  The only good thing about the set is the color.

Expanding section is nice BUT the darn thing tips over ALL the time.  Even when it's not totally full the suitcase will tip forward.  Makes it hard to stop and park your suitcase unless there's somewhere you can lean it.

Construction/quality isn't great.  One of the zippers fell off on the first trip.  And as for the ""leather"" stripe down the front - looks way more like plastic.

Not cute.  Don't buy it."
the material is like raw hide a house would not put that on there skin threw them in the trash
"I love the looks of these shoes, and I had another pair just like these that were size 9, which were WAY too big, but very soft & comfortable.  I returned those and ordered size 8 from amazon.  The size strangely is still just a tad big, (strange because I normally wear size 8.5-9), but the first day I wore them I had jury duty and had to walk about 4 blocks to the courthouse and 4 blocks back to my car.  There was something very, very ROUGH all across the top of these shoes INSIDE the shoes, and by the end of the day when I got back to my car, my feet were literally BLEEDING from the ""roughness"" in these shoes, and I had about 4-5 blisters on my feet.  i could barely make it back to my car - literally.  The first pair exactly like them, but were too big, (size 9) were REALLY SOFT and COMFORTABLE - just too big, and I did not feel any roughness at all in them.  The reason I bought these was supposed to be for comfort.  So now I have worn these shoes and can't return them, and I don't think I will ever be able to wear them because they put blisters on my feet and made them bleed.  I have never had any shoes do this to me before.  But it was a total waste of money because now that they have been worn, I can't return them.  I am very, very disappointed.  Maybe this was just a ""freak"" pair that, for whatever reason were SOOOO rough on the top part of the shoe inside.  I think probably this is the case, because the first pair I got were SUPER comfortable - just too big.  This is really strange for Crocs.  I have other Crocs and they are the most comfortable shoes I own - so why these were just so horrible, I don't know, but I'm pretty upset about the blisters and not being able to wear them.  I only received them the day before I had to go to court, so I just put them on the next day and wore them, assuming that, like my other Crocs shoes and like the previous pair like these that were too large, they would just be really comfortable..  I have never had to ""break in"" a pair of Crocs before.  Like I said, they are normally the most comfortable shoes I own.  Very, very strange, and extremely disappointing because I lost my money, and now there is nothing I can do about it because I have worn them."
"One of the cases had ten pillows missing and on the same case the top does not close were it
Lines up when you close it this product was not worth $49.99, Iam very disappointed with this product."
"Earrings were a different 'lightness' of garnet and size. Very very tarnished. Last, but not least, they are the tiniest 2mm I could barely see!"
"I returned these immediately after their arrival because the inseam is way too short. I am long waisted, though, so finding shorts and pants that fit is difficult. I liked the material and the color, and the length was good."
Fit like it was 2 sizes too small.
"The chain is very cheap, the shorter of the two parts is so short it's more like a choker and is not comfortable to wear. Thinking about just removing the charm from the longer chain to wear on a different necklace."
it has strange padding that moved around after the first wash and the padding was hard to put back into place.  I would like to remove the padding but there doesn't seem to be a way to do so without cutting the garment.
"I purchased 2 pairs of these jeans and have these complaints.
First, they are too low in the waist. If I was a 13 yr old girl I'd like that but I'm a mature man and I Don't like low waist jeans.
Second, They wrinkle badly. After wearing them for a short while they get wrinkled and that looks bad.
FYI: I'm a 34 waist and 30 length"
"I use a purse organizer, and change it from purse to purse whenever I change bags. This purse has a large center zippered compartment so I can't use the organizer. The purse is fine and well made, but not made for my needs"
Zipper is broken /  it's separated from the suitcase / only used twice! Less than 7 months old!
the dress like always  i like the material but  I think is too large at the bottom
not  true to size at all....was going to return it but my friend  liked it and it fit her so ...but she even said it is cut weird and she normally wears a size XL...and this was a 2x
"First it says it is 8.5 inches, my wrist is 8.25 and it is too short. Then as soon as I pulled it out of the package and went to try it on it fell apart. In short you would be better off going to Wal mart and making it yourself."
Entire shoe was made out of 'stretchy' elastic band. When you walk - the shoe barely held your foot in step with your stride. Uncomfortable feeling...BUT it's really cute AND if you want to wear it and SIT all day - this shoe will work for you.
It does what I need but it has several extra pockets that are to small to use for anything I can think of. After about 3 months of use the shoulder strap tore off of one side dumping everything on the ground. The other side is nearly off.
Just received it after a long wait then it don't fit very frustrating.
"this item is horible the product is very cheap i will post a picture they didn't even sew it perfectly i ashamed cuz i like to give this as a gift for my neice,so i guess i have to return this item.it just a waste of money!!!"
Wore it for 15 min and zipper broke
One of them broke while extending one of my shoes.  Poor quality.
"I like the color and design on this shirt, it's really cute.  But the collar was too tight on my throat and the rest of the shirt was too baggy.  I got the large, because most shirts like this are too small in my regular size (medium).  But the large was very large and baggy on me.  It's also very long in the torso, which can be good or bad depending on your body size.  I'm short so my torso is kind of short and the large was too long on me."
"Very comfortable (soft) and good-looking pants/jeans for men who are short and stocky as I am. It is unknown how these pants will appear after washing. My opinion is that these are more dressy pants/jeans for office wear or night out, and should not be used for hard, rough work as other denim jeans.

6/7/16 update: I ordered two more pairs of these pants, but unfortunately they were both of inferior quality and construction in comparison to the first pair of pants I received. Therefore, I lowered the star rating 3 stars on these pants. I guess that I was just lucky the first time."
"I can use them but they are a little small.  So they side off at night.  Quality of material and craftsmanship is excellent.  Just needs to be a little bigger.  My head isn't that big..  So I would recommend this for someone with a big head  or super thick hair.

Ordered 2 in black and 1 white one."
"These socks are weird. Very soft, and fall down almost immediately. They just don't work well and I cant recommend them."
First of all when I first opened it I noticed it wasn't sewn together very well and was already falling apart. Second it was sewn together wrong and was all twisted so it would not line up or be put on correctly. It ended up ripping in the process. Not worth the money
Dansko is so inconsistent in sizing.  I will not order this brand again.
Not original Ray Ban sunglasses.  I'm not a expert by far but they are definitely fakes.  I still do like them but would not pay that much for something that is not real.  Price point should be 1/4 of the selling price.  I gave two stars for effort.
"As per usual, I was hoping this was going to be as small as people were complaining it was - it was not. I'm around a 00 petite in jackets and this just did not look right on me. The sleeves were kind of long and the shoulders a bit big and the straps stuck out weirdly. Had to return it."
Cheap and stretches out quick
"I love these dresses and have ordered three.  However I am not fond of the plastic pearl buttons they put on them... I clip them off asap.
*Revised review:  The dresses are adorable, initially.  I have not yet had the dress a month and after wearing it once I realized that the colors have run and faded.  I cringe to think what will happen when washed.  The fabric is extremely poor quality and does not hold up.  So disappointing.

After 1 washing the dress has faded horribly (and I used delicate detergent and air-dried the dress).  If you only want to wear this once you will be happy but if you expect to be able to wash and wear again, you will be disappointed with the dress."
This fit very small my. Arm holes too small for me to wear. It doesn't cover my butt all the way like photo shows. Its T-shirt material.
"Unfortunately all the reviews about these shirts are absolutely correct. I wear a size 14 shirt and I ordered the biggest size and it does not fit. I will be able to wear it as a over shirt but that is about all it is good for. However, I will say the shirt is very well made, and the material is not flimsy I am just sorry that the sizing is so off"
Considerable smaller than posted size.
I originally gave these earrings 5 stars. It was a birthday gift and I didn't think to take the earrings out of the holder it came in and check if they were BLACK. But they are and I told my friend to throw them out because we don't know if it will infect her daughters ears and it's not worth taking the risk. So when buying these earrings check them throughly before giving them to someone who visited u and lives in another state... like I did. The butterfly appearance and back holder piece looked fine to me. I have to be more careful from now on.
"I am a size 6 and I ordered my regular size and that was a big mistake. I should have ordered a half size up, but I am not sure that would make up for the very narrow toe box on this shoe. You may need to order a full size up. Its beautiful, but not comfortable. The detail was amazing, but I had to return this item. There's no way I can walk down the aisle in those let alone stand up there an say my vows without being in terrible pain."
"Size is great, but the black ""leather"" is already peeling off.  Sucks 'cause that never happened on the larger ones I ordered of this same brand."
The face is cute but it was too big for my wrist. You also can't adjust/remove the links. I ended up returning it!
"Prior to purchase, I read the reviews and purchased the shoes a half a size larger (8..5) than my actual size (8).  I have a narrow foot so the shoes proved to be too wide in addition to too long.  Very difficult to get the shoe on and off the foot also!  The shoes have been returned for a refund."
"Big traditional second hand (at least for a newbie) is stationary, the actual second hand is the bottom chronograph dial.  IT drives me crazy I always think it is stopped!  Only months of owning, and the watch band literally fell apart at the top.  I am very disappointed in the quality of the band!  The MOP dial is vibrant though.

And the watch is huge like a mans, and heavy."
"Soft insides, but won't buy again as the color wore off on the outside within 2 months"
"The strap stretches out and breaks off in a couple days use. Only kept keys, wallet, and the other random light/small purse clutter. Not heavy at all. I'm so very disappointed with this purchase."
Came in with the interior corners fabric ripping.
"Arrived on time and packed well. Looked perfect but could not set date and day.
Returned without a problem and requested a replacement.."
"I bought the size 12 for my husband which is his typical size. He has a very flat foot but does not normally require a ""wide"" shoe. When the shoe arrived, we both loved the colors and design, but the fit was very bad. From the outside, you could see his foot coming over the sole of the shoe on the inside where the arch of the foot would be, and he said it was very uncomfortable. So, we exchanged them for the 12 wide. Slightly better but still the same problem. We almost questioned if they were not manufactured correctly b/c the fit was so strange. As I said, we have never had this problem before with his shoes."
This was so thin and awful that we didn't even wear it.
This is an okay scarf that has cute colors but is poorly made. The thread on the scarf was already unraveling when I received it in the mail. I don't know how often I will be able t wear it before it falls apart completely. It is also very thin cheap material. I received this product at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased feedback and would not recommend purchasing this item to others who are looking for a quality scarf.
Returned them too narrow for my foot.
This product I will  never buy broken and poor workmanship.
Very very long if you're a shorter girl.
Do not waste your money! Returned bag. Bag made of cheap material.
Muy peque&ntilde;o y ademas pura imitacion.
sizes run way small
Pandora charms do not fit on this bracelet. I can understand some of the other brand sterling silver charms not fitting. Returned for refund
SIZE DID NOT FIT AS EXPECTED
"Material is very, very thin and the pants run large!  These are not like my other yoga pants at all.  I am not happy."
"Low quality product. Cheap price = cheap product. You are not getting a deal, you're getting way you paid for."
"Manufacturer CHOOSES to ignore and not serve a full normal range of sizes.  No sizes below 6 are offered.  I encourage you to take your business to brands that make and sell sizes 4, 4.5, 5, and 5.5.  There are huge numbers of women unable to find shoes because of this manufacturing trend.  Please vote with your dollars or at least express your displeasure to brands you love that fail."
"Tried to save money by getting this shoe that had been returned.  It had been worn enough that I felt like I was putting on someone else's shoe.  Immediately my left foot was in pain as bones were rearranged.  I went on a bike ride to allow the shoe to warm and stretch to my foot, but it never did.  I was hobbling later and the shoes have been on the bench since.  How much of a bargain is a bargain you can't use?"
Will not stay up.
Too small and looks cheap
Not for tall people!!!!
"The package has the right description, however the wallet inside is not even close to the one described and pictured. No ID window, no credit card slots under flap, and the side pocket is just a split in the seam closed by velcro.  As this item is not shipped from Amazon there is no way to exchange it. Have to return it and eat the difference. Buyer beware."
"Too small.  I tried to stretch them, but the stretcher would not go deep enough into the toe of the shoe to stretch that part of the shoe."
"Only comes in one size for men  7-12 (mens).
Dad is size 10 men shoe size and the socks were too small.
Quality of socks is excellent."
These earrings are pretty but they are to heavy.  Pull your ears bad.dont waste your money. Need to be lighter
"4/22/14 -- Original Review: Gold toe socks last forever, after daily use my husbands socks needed to be replaced after five(ish) years. Yes the socks are expensive, but would you rather buy the ones in the local stores where you need to replace them after six months to a year?

The toe never wears out, its normally the heel that eventually goes. The calf part of the socks always maintains its elasticity regardless of the fact that my husband is a big man and stretches them while in use.

5/2/14 -- Updated review: NOT THE SAME QUALITY!!!! My husband's socks are wearing out the day that he picks them up out of the bag. He works in a retail store and is on his feet 8 hours a day, by the time he gets home a LARGE hole the size of a dollar coin is in them. Previously I'd purchased this in a retail location but I expected Amazon to have the same thing, maybe Gold Toe's quality has gone down significantly... well something is obviously wrong here."
"this boots simply suck,  I returned then  the same day I got them. there is no padding or lining in the inside , they felt like frankenstein shoes.
dont buy plus there are not made in usa as claimed .china."
"This dress does not fit properly. It's too baggy and is not flattering at all. I had to return it. I am 115 lbs and 5'6"" and got a size small. I am also quite large through the chest and even so it was still too baggy."
Top fits as a large but for some reason the leg holes are so small for a large size.
"Do not waste your money ! This is far too over priced for a vest that comes in the form of crepe paper. It's so cheap ! It looks nothing like the photo and shouldn't cost the asking price that's for sure !!! It's so cheap looking, it's embarassing to be seen in it"
"Cheep, flimsy, like wearing a tarp or a rain coat. It was uncomfortable, itchy, easy to damage and all around horrible."
"This pants came with a big hole in the right leg,"
"USE
Bought this water shoe for a beach trip to protect my feet from hot sand while walking the beach and sharp rocks while swimming. It did these things well, however, once sand got into the shoe, it was difficult to get it out.

FIT
I normally wear an 11/12, and the 11 fit me with no room to spare (good for a water shoe). This probably means the shoe is running a bit large. I had no problems with the insert slipping out or the shoe falling off. The shoe was quite comfortable to wear. At first it kept rubbing my angle, but I loosened the elastic drawstring and that solved the problem.

CLEANING
This shoe is very difficult to clean. No matter how much sand I rinsed out of the shoe, there always seemed to be more, even though I removed the insert. The shoe also takes FOREVER to dry. I tried hanging them, leaving them on a towel with a fan blowing, and leaving them in the sunshine to dry, but without fail, they wouldn't be completely dried by the next day. After 3 days of use, they started to develop a funky mold smell and I had to throw them in the washing machine to get rid of it. Way more than I bargained for.

OVERALL
Overall, the shoe was great for the first use, and a waste thereafter. I wouldn't buy it again."
"I lost the return window because I bought these before a trip, and didn't have time to deal.  I might try to stretch them out, but the ridge over the top of the foot is very stiff, and rubs me just the wrong way.  Might be better for someone with a skinnier foot.  These were same size as some Bandolino's I bought, and those were perfect, so it's all about what form they used to build the shoe."
"Nice top, but even the XL was way too tight across the chest.  Very sad I'll have to return it."
"But, after reading such negative comments about the fit and comfort level, I will not be purchasing them.  :(  It is especially tough to order on line when it sounds like there is about a 99% chance that they will be returning to where they came from.  Darn!  They are still cute!
RS"
"The shoes are very light, but they do not have much support or cushion.  I can feel a hard heel impact when I walk.  I normally wear sneakers from Saucony, Nike, New Balance, or ASICS.  The comfort can only be rated within the lower 10% of my sneakers, but the price is within top 10%, just for the big name.  I give it 2 stars not 1 star because it makes my feet appear narrower."
material is cheap and it's shorter than expected.
"I've purchased several pairs of CK boxer briefs. They're all I've worn for years. These once in particular are by far the most uncomfortable, and by far the most expensive. Way to small which makes them ride up consistently. I won't buy these again"
"The 'hardex' crystal is not very scratch resistant. I brought it as an everyday watch to wear to work. I'm a nurse, so it actually doesn't receive much contact with hard sharp surfaces. But is was scratche up within a month. Also note it is a better size for a woman than a man."
"These are WAY TOO SMALL. It's like half the length and width of a normal size. Ordered in size 11 for my daughter who wears 10, she can't even get her foot into this thing. Are these for dolls? Very disappointing."
I only received 48 beads. 10 of those were broken (missing the silver grommets). 6 have a 925 stamp on the silver. None of them look nearly as pretty as the picture. Shipping took forever too.
"Ordered these for my son for school. I ordered a bigger size, thinking they would last him longer. Well, when they arrived...I put them up and away. Just 2wks later when school started he wanted to wear these, and they barely fit. I'd say they run small on their sized. I ordered 3 pairs of pumas, ordered all bigger than actual size...all fit too small. Now I know to order at least 2 sizes too big, due to spending so much money, and kids not being able to get what I paid out of them."
The strap has no velcro and easily slips out -- not ideal for child at all.  We sent it back immediately.
I've always been good with 13M or W. This pair of 13M were too long and very narrow. Bad fit. Had to return them. Nice looking sneak and a good price but their sizing may be off the mark.
The zipper was terrible and the tassel broke off super easily when I tried to open the zipper. I am returning it. The colors are super cute so I am really sad to return it but just not worth the fight with the zipper and if something broke that easily I just fear the entire bag may not last.
Crap Boots one month and they are spent
"total crap. wore this ring a few times and eventually it turned my finger green. such a bummer b/c i love how this ring looks! beware though, it's not good quality.  the silver patina rubs off and reveals a brass ring underneath. i believe if you read the product description it does actually say it's made of brass, but how could you really know that by just looking at it? also i had no clue it would rub off so easily. NOT recommended unless you only want to wear it once or twice."
"Description says it is 42"" coverage but it's only 34"". Opening it and closing it didn't inspire confidence that it would hold up in a wind. It IS light in weight but not what I was looking for in terms of construction."
The waist gaps
"You get what you pay for...it's like the size of my thumb, very lightweight too."
"I did not like anything about this shoe, but the color. The heel was much taller than I expected and I did not like the material."
Iooks like plastic bracelet from a dollar store
The bottom piece came off the minute my son opened it. Not sturdy at all. We threw it away about 2 days later after it kept coming off during play.
"Cheap material, great for a Halloween costume."
"It is what it says. Except after wearing it alot. the gloss is not as glossy, but that is wear and tear.."
"These run really, really small, just too lazy to ship back. very hard to get over head especially with one bad shoulder and one replaced shoulder."
This item is very small even for a 3 month old baby. I guess their sizes run small.
These clogs rubbed a blister on my instep
"Order a size up, maybe 2 be honest with yourself about your RIB measurement, i am a 34 G bra size (36 around the actual RIBS) so i ordered an XL even though it is a below bust design.
Not a very quality product, i guess i should have known by the price. it would work if you don't mind poor quality craftsmanship, it would probably hold up for a one time costume event as long as you were slim to med build and it was not expected to do any real ""corseting""... i used to make costumes professionally, because of my disappointment in the overall construction down to the weak metal funky buckles, one sided Faux Leather and uneven application of the brads for decoration i sent mine back.
I was a fool to depend on this for my halloween costume when i have such high standards.
It did fit as expected i am a petite muscular built woman about 10 lbs overweight."
You get what you pay for.  These are priced cheap for a reason.  They are junk.  Don't waste your money.
"Very cute, but the seams are already pulling out and they're a month old."
This is so small it will not go up by legs.  It's a size large and I wear a size 6-8 in clothes. Way to little and need to send it back.
I wanted gray boots and the color in person was much more brown than gray so I returned them.
"Unfortunately this skirt was a huge disappointment for me. First of all, the fabric is not very great, but as the print on it is pretty, I could have lived with that and also the fact that it needs ironing to look acceptable. The bigger problem is that the skirt does not have a full shape, so in my case, while it fits my waist (just barely), the skirt picks up on my hips and does not really get wide enough to fall freely. This is really not what I was expecting, as with high waisted A line skirts I usually just have to make sure the waist fits, and the rest works out fine. I do need to note that I have very wide hips, and I wear a larger size in pants than tops and there's quite a bit of a difference between my waist and hips - so if you're not a very pronounced pear shape, this skirt might fit you way better. Another issue for me was that it has an underskirt, but it is so short and so small I couldn't pull it down on my hips (if I was keeping the skirt, I guess I could cut it out). Yet another issue is the way the elastic waistband was tailored: the elastic inside it in my case is sort of twisted, and does not lie flat even when completely stretched.
I hate to leave such a negative review, but I will have to return this skirt as I'm sure I won't wear it.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
"I have a boat load of ecco shoes.. like 10 pair and the dress shoes are so comfy.  This was not one of those and had a weird feel to it.  Didn't fit right and didn't feel like the price I paid, sent them back."
"I wasn't expecting anything great, just a plastic hook for my son's Halloween costume, but this is not even worth a penny! Straight from the package, it won't even stay together. Found a better one even cheaper at hobby lobby."
"Got this for the hubs and he loves it. Can never go wrong with Nike.

6/12/16: review update: Just bought this end of April and now it's flat already! Husband has been wearing this about 3-4x/week since we bought it  to do weight training and today he noticed the air on the bottom of both shoes is now deflated. We've bought the same airmax from Nordstroms before and that never happened with that pair, even after wearing it for 3+years!  This gives me the suspicion that this company who sells it might be selling fake products because I doubt real Nike products would break down only after 2 my months of light use!"
They fit great! Fabric is soooo soft. Wore them and poked a hole in them putting them on! The fabric is soooo ugh
"Received boots today, I have wanted this style for months..  I finally decided to order them.  Very disappointed they were used and previously worn boots.  The heel and sole were scraped up and the toe was scuffed. I love the fit and feel of these boots, just very sad these were used boots."
"Quality control, folks!!  Merrell should be paying much closer attention.  the cute little strap that goes on the side of the foot is a totally different length on both shoes.  One shoe, it's the correct length, but the other shoe, it's far too long, so it bulges up away from  my foot.  It looks really stupid.  Also, this sandal runs short, at least for me.  I am returning them.  And I will never buy on Amazon when it isn't Prime ever again because I have to pay for my own shipping to return these.  What a waste!!!!"
"Quick Shipping.  I got it the next day.  I just didn't like it and had to return it.  The handbag had a funny odor and didn't look good on my shoulder.  I wanted a bigger bag, but it was too big.  The bottom has a hard insert so it sticks out from your body.  Easy return though."
"Wishing we hadn't waited 2 weeks to gift this to our son... because we missed the Amazon return date.  As with other reviews about this backpack, the top loop handle broke (tore off) in 3 weeks.  Our son (7YO) loves the look, but as parents we are very disappointed with the quality.  This damage wasn't from abuse, the rest of the backpack is in mint condition and is only used M-F for school.  Be ready to do some MacGyver fixing and/or keep a close eye on your Amazon refund date.  We missed ours by less than a week :("
Dress was small and very short
Bleh! Im not impressed. It did nothing to hold in my  post baby pudge. I prefer Vedette products (compression) better.
"Made to fit a teenager or pre teen, made very small"
"I loved the necklace at first, then the middle bead kept popping out on one side until it broke and all the beads fell out. The first week of having it."
Bought sizes up like mentioned and still too small. When I got it pieces were falling apart already.
"I've had these for approximately 2 months now and wear them no less than 40 hours a week. They are randomly slipping and not doing their job. I do not have them super tight. They are just tight enough to keep the shirt tucked in, but not so tight that I can't sit or bend without issue. There is no reason for them to slip off the shirt. Would not buy again."
This dress is a nice design but runs larger. The material feels cheap as well.
"Don't buy this boot if you intend using it roughly, rugged, heavy use....The boots toe area is shredded and came apart after 3 months work at Costco.....
Will not buy again. Way too much money for this quality, l expected better!"
"I waited over a week for these. The reader portion aren't as strong as my regular reading glasses, so they aren't worth having. What a waste."
It's too small. The material is cheap and sweaty.
Too small..its not what I'm expected!
"It took WEEKS for this scarf to be delivered. Just ridiculous for a little scarf to take that long!! It also does NOT look like the picture. It's not a pretty purple, but a very muted drab color. Very disappointing. Too much trouble to return, so will probably put it in a donation box. Because of the lousy shipping experience, it doesn't deserve any stars!"
Sizing chart is off size 3 is not a 28.5 in waste I'm a 27in waste. Got the buttoned but it flattened my but and gave me spare tie. Order your normal size the chart is wrong should have ordered the 7s like I originally had in my cart.
The shoes are not real timberlands they are FAKE DO NOT BUY THEY ARE FAKE 
There at a good price but could you possibly make more sizes like a 9 or 10 please
"These don't look nearly as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/crocs-Men-s-Hover-Sneaker/dp/B003YUU62U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">crocs Men's Hover  Sneaker</a>&nbsp;There's no Croc logo on the back heel, the accent of stretch fabric is not black, its more flat across the top of the shoe.  Really the other one is better but they didn't have my size so I tried this one.  Sending it back"
"Unfortunately, the construction of this shoe is lacking in my opinion.  The upper portion is very flimsy, and the shoe does not fit as expected, even if I tightened the strap completely.  I returned the shoe."
"Very pretty, Very small."
"Really, one size fits all! Hardly, not unless you weight 100 lbs. or less. I received these, checked the stretch and immediately sent them on to my niece who is 5 ft. 4 in. and weighs 98 lbs."
"I'm very disappointed. I bought this after having my son, when it wasn't offered via Prime, and it took WEEKS to arrive. My own mistake I suppose but more importantly, the zip-front is very uncomfortable (I hated it the minute I put it on) and just now, the zipper broke! I'm holding it closed while I pump. I only pump a few times a week, so I'm surprised it broke so quickly. I'm going to be ordering a new one from another company that uses Velcro."
Material is like a school uniform....not soft at all
I am so sad!  These are listed as a wide width but fit like a regular medium width.  They are well constructed and would probably have been perfect if they actually were a wide width!
Hard and hurts feet
"This hat, advertised as the same ""Magic"" brand cap which I had previously ordered, was actually a cheaper ""no-name"" version, of a lesser quality.  It has a Velcro adjuster, instead of the original metal clasp; and there were no metal grommets on the sides for ventilation as with the first.  The bill of the cap was also less sturdy.  I hope that AMAZON (or the seller) matches the cap as ""advertised"" next time."
"after  2 year of rare use, the largest Luggage's handle just broke down"
"These things are freaking HUGE, their the size of a small pear , no joke!!!"
"These boots looked great for the first 3-5 wears. The ""leather"" straps dried and flaked first, then the rubber degraded and split with 6 months. Even thought they were rarely worn and stored in a cool dry closet they didn't last past a season."
I have spent far less on many far more comfortable bras. The material on this bra is scratchy and inflexible. The bra feels cheap. I paid such a huge price for this bra and it's pobably the worst one in my drawer. Such a shame. Don't let the high pricetag fool you. This bra is cheap!
"I liked it but ordered my size xl and was too small, tight all over.  liked the color navy blue."
"This hat is poorly made. The material on the bill kept moving and covering the button on the first day, so it wouldn't stay fastened. I wish I wouldn't sent it back."
Larger foot socks should have larger calf & ankle so they don't cut into your leg.
"Not sure why it has to be so raspy on the inside, thought it would be smooth on the inside. Didn't know my elbows were rough until trying this shirt."
"Sole is harder than the beige pair I have, too hard to wear comfortably all day, so I am returning these."
"Look fine, but are really tight and no arch support."
I ordered a small and it definitely fits me like a large.
Not impressed. One strap was larger than other & flips under.
Offers no support. Fits loose.
"It fit too small, very unconfortable"
"I cannot wear them, they are two wide at the ankle and two wide around the calves.  I was so disappointed."
they run 1 size small
One time in the washer and the shoulder strap broke.  Very poor quality.
So stiff. Hard to fold in half once anything is inside.
dosent work
These appear much bigger and appear to be a much brighter color on the model shown than they are in person. The ones I received are a pale baby blue and are very small in size. So don't go by the way they appear on the model. I wouldn't order from this company again.
"I've ordered a second replacement of this west but it has the same problem as the first one. When the zipper is touching my neck it feels scratchy. I have very sensitive skin and can't wear anything scratchy.
However, I do love 32degrees brand. I own three packable jackets from them, and I love them all."
RETURNED. NO HASSLE ONCE AGAIN WITH AMAZON. SIZING WAY OFF. I WEAR A SIZE 12. MY SON GAVE ME A PAIR OF DIFFERENT STYLE MUCK BOOTS IN SIZE 11 THAT FIT AND ARE MORE COMFORTABLE .
"I bought two pair of New Balance shoes quite awhile back.  I can't see the model number on the tags in them now because the tags are worn out.  I do see a ""600"" embossed on the tongues of the shoes, though.

Anyway, I bought the two pairs on 9-12-08 and today is 10-30-12.  So I've had the two pairs for over 4 years.  They are all I've been wearing for the entire time that I've owned them.  I alternate wearing between the two pair.  They held up very well.  The only thing that wore out on them was the lining on the inside of the heels.  I suppose that can be fixed by a shoe repairman.

Since I had good luck with both pairs of the old New Balance shoes, I expected the same from the new pair of the 577 model.  I was terribly disappointed.  I bought the new ones mail order and the old ones at J C Penney where I was fitted in person.  I should not have mail ordered the new ones.  I don't think I'm going to mail order any more shoes.  This is the second time I've had serious problems when mail ordering shoes.

The New Balance 577 shoes were *nothing* like the old New Balance shoes.  I was busy and forgot about them and was hoping that I could get them to break in.  Anyway, I went past the period where you can return them, but I'm going to try to return them anyway.  I know they aren't made right and don't fit and I just messed up my left heel (and maybe the right one, to some extent) after walking only a couple of blocks in them.  As far as I'm concerned, the shoes are *junk*.  They look and feel and fit nothing like my old New Balance shoes.  I would never even guess that they were made by the same company as the older ones.  I also noticed that New Balance was bragging that these new 577 shoes are made in the USA.  Actually, my old New Balance shoes were made in China, as far as I know. Maybe it would have been better if they'd kept making them in China."
"Although I loved the color and the idea of this product, I left a trail of feathers behind me wherever I went. It was just messy and did not hold together well."
I did not  buy this.
So NOT happy with this order! It isn't worth the money I paid for it. Cheap quality and breaks fast  it broke just taking it out of the bag SMDH!!!
"Cute shirt, but the sizes displayed in the size chart ARE NOT THE SIZES OF THE CLOTHING SHIPPED."
"The boots were very cute but very small.  I own another pair of Naughty monkey boots in an 8 and love them, but I read the reviews, which said they ran small so I ordered an 8.5 - they are closer to a 7!!!  I have posted a picture of the boots next to some old Rocket Dog boots (with a similar heel) in an 8.5, and you can see that they are nowhere near the same size.
 Sizing issues made these a return for me, but they are very cute and seem to be well made if you can get the right size.
To answer another customers question, the boots are suede on the outside but they are lined with a synthetic suede-type material."
I was expecting larger locks for my Pelican cases and photo gear. I'm disappointed in how small these things are. However I will keep them because I'm sure I will find a use for them eventually.
"way too narrow in the calf.  L-o-n-g foot that is right around, and after the first wash couldn't wear them comfortably because of the tight calves."
It's pretty but never worn it - I put it on and take it back off cause I can't stand the fit and arms -
"I wanted a highly organized shoulder bag.  The straps are attached so that it is more of a cross body bag. If you try to use it as a shoulder bag, you will find the straps attached at the wrong angle and it is too tall to fit the curve at a woman's waist."
"You are getting exactly what you pay for with this product.

The zipper and construction are cheap. Overall, it feels like something you would get as packaging to be thrown away when you buy new formal clothes. The handles are placed without any though as to how one would actually carry the bag.

That being said, I still use it. The zipper fell off, but the fabric hasn't ripped. I just use it to carry my tuxedo back and forth to music school.

If you are in the market, check thrift stores!"
"Fit is super. The crisscross design is unique,  something different from the regular plain one. It hugs the legs, doesn't scroll down when one sits. But durability?  I give only 2 stars because it tore the 5th time I wore. Its been a month I bought this legging and very happy to leave a 5star review until today. It tore. Im disappointed. I really liked it and was expecting to wear this season at the least."
They run smaller
The bag strip broken the first time I use it!!!
It's ok... looks like the picture.
"I truly wish I had never bought this item but I'm way out of the return window now.  I work and play outside year round but I'm unfortunately cold when it's below 70 degrees.  That is why I have a large bin of long underwear and cold gear of all types.  After a particularly chilly backpacking trip due to wind, I decided to up my game with these and wow I don't think I could be more disappointed.

First, they are quite bulky for being of what I would consider high design and even higher price tag that you get when you go Arcteryx.  Compared to a UA base 4, I'd say they are almost twice as thick for not even being as warm.  As to any wind protection, HA!, yeah, no.  Maybe 5 mph.  20 mph is coming straight through.  I was recently on a trip at the Canadian border when a cold spell broke.  I put on a thin base layer, a medium, and these and was still cold till I threw rainpants over top.  When I used UA layering, it was far superior on top of being cheaper.

I'll wear them but it will never be for recreational activity and I will put them in the for work pile where I can wear more bulky stuff under my bib overalls.  These remind me more of my cheaper expedition weight stuff that ran in the 30 dollar range.  If that's what I had paid, I would have been happy with the product but there is just no way these perform at the level claimed and priced.  This is likely the last time I shell out the money for this brand.  With long underwear, it can make the difference between misery and happiness but you don't know it till you get out in the cold.  Lesson learned.

One positive, they fit true to size and are quite comfy."
This is beautiful I asked for a size 24 month on all the clothing I will see if they fit I am not satified  with this order
WWWWWWWWWay too small
"I ordered 2 sizes of these both fit perfectly.  They were for my 2 daughter of different ages.
They are a little thin almost a thicker t shirt material which is okay for my smaller chested daughter.  However not really strong enough for the larger chest.  She used the cups from a swim suit and sewed them into the inside

They both really liked the straps and said they were comfortable yet not too wide that you seen them

My biggest complaint is that they didn't hold up well.  After about 4-5 washing they started getting holes along the underside seems.

The one that reinforced hers is the only one still wearable out of all 4.

I would not buy again."
"I have always purchased these pants for work. My most recent purchase of a 16 long, are way too tight. The quality of the pants are not like they used to be either. Will definitely have to find different pants to buy."
"I'm disappointed in this belt. It feels very lightweight and flimsy, even though it is thick. I have my doubts as to how well it will hold up. The brown side is very dark brown, almost black. It also runs small.
I also want to say I'm extremely disappointed in Amazon's refusal to exchange this item. They only offer a refund for the sale price I bought it at and I would have to pay the difference to repurchase the belt again. This belt is not worth full price. It's cheap Chinese junk with a Levi's name attached."
Fit as expected BUT....lack of good inner sole support made my feet hurt.
"The colors are not even close to as advertised, which was the primary reason for purchase. They do, however, fit pretty nicely, so overall not too shabby."
"Will be returning, size runs way small."
very sharp edges....
Fit was ok however I'm not sure this one is for me . The shoe is flimsy and does not offer enough support especially on the sides. Do not get caught in the rain these shoes flex through to the sole insert and get your sock wet. Not a practical shoe.
So disappointed. Such a pretty bikini but the top was just too small
Nice cut But the quality of the fabric is not good.
"Too thick, poor quality, too fragile even if I wanted to use these."
Very thin and the stripes on the front do not line up with the back.
"Incredibly short and tight.  I'm 5' 5"" and the dress hit just a couple inches below my rear; much shorter than the picture."
"First of all, these are great looking shorts. I bought them 1 size bigger based on reviews, and they fit perfectly.

The problem is that they already ripped about an hour after I washed them for the first time! About a 10 inch long tear along the right back pocket as I was sitting down on a couch.
That's a shame because I love the look and feel of the shorts, but if they're going to last less than a week I can't recommend them.
1 star plus 1 for appearance"
My boy is 9 months old and 50% for height and weight.  I bought the 12 month pair thinking he might grow into them.  They were so tight on him that they cut into his legs and were too uncomfortable to wear within five minutes.  Total waste of money.
I had to return these.  There were too tight around the arch.
Sizing is way off on these.  I have several pairs of New Balance shoes and there is no way what was delivered was a size 12.  Either marked work at the factory or their size chart is way off.
"I liked these sandals because they were soft sole and just wanted something that looked cute with her dresses and protect her feet from the heat on the concrete.  The shoes are a bit big.  Her little toes get stuck on the straps.  I even put socks on with the sandals and her toes still were able to get in between the ""slits.""  I feel the problem is they are too wide and her foot slides in all directions, and also due to the fact that the material if very soft, there isn't much support to keep her feet from moving all around.  But they are very pretty if your baby is not walking yet."
Nice looking show but runs too big.
"Holy friggin huge!!!! Wow
Two sizes to big..."
did not like fit. Wacol is good quality that is why I brought. size was small but cups did not fit right.
And the fabric doesn't feel good on my hand.  It feels so hot I didn't even try it on.  The straps are skinnier than the picture looks.  It looks cheap compared to the picture.
These fell apart so quickly.. I thought with a brand name like car hart they would last longer than Hanes.  No good there.  Typical white socks with an expensive name.
"These are GIANT- as in, too big to be cute. I typically wear a size 10 in clothing, so I was pretty surprised that these were so big on me. I haven't decided if I want to return them or try and salvage them with my sewing machine."
returned face larger than expected
Follow the sizing instructions to the letter only to get shoes that are over an inch longer than expected.
"I bought two pair of leveret brand pjs, these and the moon and stars, both navy. The moon and stars were perfect. The polar bear pjs were stiff, and the pants were poorly dyed or the fabric didn't take it well. Even after washing they still felt like cardboard."
"I ordered these jeans for my son based on the photo provided because they depicted black jeans with tan stitching.  However, the jeans I received had black stitching not tan.  I am thinking about returning them because he already has a pair of jeans exactly like this."
"The color is not nearly as vibrant as in the picture, quite frankly it is rather faded. I will not buy again. Poor quality control, or meant to mislead."
"I already have the UPS return receipt to send this back for credit.  I think there were so many on sale because the sizing was so far off the mark.

I wear this size all the time in other bras I buy and this was just huge.  Couldn't give this one away so I'm sending it back.

Uses to getting good products but NOT this time.  Oh well."
It really isn't as great as this photo and you will be itchy like crazy so this isn't for long term use. It's already becoming not gold anymore. I wish I wouldve bought this from somewhere else and spent a little more so I could enjoy it further instead of experiencing patina already. Not worth the time or money for the hassle you will deal with
"very tight, can not wear with sock on!"
"The band was small by at least three inches.  Was able to use an extender, but it most definely is not a ""Pull Over."""
"Fit as expected the size , but quality is not as expected"
"Flimsy, cheap product"
I do not like this my daughter put boot on and when removed the whole inner part comes out every time
"I ordered up a size, so the top fit well.  The problem was the arms.  The band around the arm is elastic but so tight that I barely got the shirt on!  I have slightly muscular arms, but this was made for someone with toothpicks!  I couldn't keep this arm strangling shirt.  Otherwise the look was exactly what I wanted."
"If I could give this review ZERO stars I would.  This item was SUPPOSED to have the Darth Vader face printed on the INSIDE so the wearer can just flip it up in front of their face.  However, when it FINALLY arrived (an entire MONTH late... it was supposed to be an xmas gift but didn't get here from CHINA - not Ohio as advertised - until almost the end of January) the Vader face was printed on the BACK of the shirt... NOTHING like described in the picture.  I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN."
"The Amazon vendor was great, but I was very disappointed as 2 pair broke only 1 day after wearing one time. I bought them for my trip to Europe and wore one pair 2 weeks prior to leaving. One shoe broke on day one. The vendor was great and sent a replacement pair right away. The pair broke on my 1st excursion. Too bad...comfortable shoe but not sturdy.."
"My great grandson wears a size 2 and I ordered a size 3.  They are way to small for him.  The legs are tight around, the crotch isn't long enough.  If I were to wash them they would be a size 1."
"I purchased this blouse, based on other positive reviews.  I don't know what I was excpecting, but I am not impressed.
It is cheaply made, and doesn't hang well.  Not crazy about the shoulders either.  I waited too long to return, so now
I'm stuck with it.  Hoping my daughter might get some use out of it, as it is too snug on me.  I purchased an up-size
due to previous reviews, but it was still too snug.  Oh well.  Better luck next time!"
I have several pairs of Jag Jeans. I always wear the same size. These were AT LEAST 2 sizes too small than my other jeans.
"I had high hopes for those based on reviews, but was bitterly disappointed. When they arrived, thy are very fake-leather looking. They're very plastic, almost like a rainboot.

My calves are 17.5, and based on reviews I thought these would work, but they didn't even zip halfway. I measured the widest part, and it can accommodate 16"" and no more.

Finally, I'm only 5""4, but these were nowhere near knee boot; they only came up mid-calf for me. Just a weird boot."
"After using this wallet for about two months, the card slots loosened so much so that credit cards have been
falling out routinely.  Since our purchase date was such that it cannot be returned, we are unable to return for a refund
Disappointing!"
I received it with a hole in it :(
I ordered size M  I am 135 LB  it doesn't fit the  Way it looks  no shape .
"Cute style but cheap. I'd get blisters, for sure. They also run big. I normally wear a 6.5 or 7, so ordered a 6 and they're still too big."
About a half size too small or maybe even a full size.  Not very good quality... look cheap in person.
"The frames are nice, but the lens are distorted which makes them useless as I needed them for reading glasses."
"Cute shoe, but did not fit well and not high quality.  I ordered a wide width, but it was very small in the toe area. My toes were almost off the shoe. Also, the thong was very painful between the toes. I returned them."
"Very cute and love Teva products in general but, this left a huge blister on our daughters foot after only wearing them for an hour.  Very disappointed."
I've had this top for several months now and this top rolls constantly and will not stay put. Super annoying. I ordered a medium since I'm busty but maybe a small would've been a better choice? I no longer use it and it was a complete waste of money.
"Hell, if I could give this a quarter of a star I would. It deserves 1/10 because the point it gets is for covering my toes. That is all. There's a huge reason why they're on sale for only 50$. I would never buy these full retail much less than 50$ had I known how disappointing these shoes are.

Had these for about a month. Wore them 3 days a week. Walking bare feet would is much more comfortable.

Pros:

- Wonderful pair of shoes for walking in dog s***
- none
- great pair of shoes to wear down your feet to get a bionic limb.
- great way to learn a hard lesson to invest in quality shoes.
- great way to rack up feet related medical bills.

Cons:

- no insoles.
- no aftermarket insoles will make this shoe even remotely wearable.
- makes your feet hurt, especially the heels.
- not even water proof. My feet wear soaked after a full day of wearing them on a moderate to heavy rainy day.
- sides of the shoe flaps flair out even after tying it down tightly.
- made in Vietnam, I'm Vietnamese and know not to buy anything made in Vietnam. Had Nike Shox and they fell apart after a months of use. Guess where its made from, Vietnam.
- soles get dirty real quick, can't exchange or return them if they are
- Poor ""leather"" quality. I scratched it lightly with my finger nail to test it out and left a noticeable mark.

Would, never EVER recommend these shoes to anybody. Please, please don't consider buying these. If you have return them before wearing them outside. These shoes are abysmal."
This hat is so stift it doesn't flap down. It had whay feels like wire around the brim of the hat that you have yo work out tonthe position you want you still look crazy.
"I purchased the peacock skirt thinking that I would like to wear it the way it was displayed in the pictures, but I got it and just felt complete disappointment. It just wasn't a buy for me."
"Depending on the brand I fit into a 10 or 12 in skinny jeans. NJDJ advertises on the label they have ""lift tuck technology"" to make you look a size smaller. I could not button the 10s but the legs fit fine, and in the 12s I could button them but the whole front, hips and butt felt tight and uncomfortable, while the legs were baggy and not what I typically want in a skinny jean, so I guess these are regular leg jeans? Anyhow the top is so tight trying to suck in the body that it **causes** squish out at the top creating a big muffin top which I do not have with other brands of skin tight skinny jeans that I bought this season. I rate these as a 2 = I Don't Like It as they fit baggy in the leg, the lift tuck technology is uncomfortable and they cause me to look unnatural with a big muffin top."
"I have a very wide foot and have a very difficult time finding shoes that fit well. This shoe is made large! The length did not seem too long when I felt the end of my toes in the shoe, but the heel slips terribly. The front of the shoe slipped some as well. I was able to resolve the fit problem with bottom inserts and heel slip inserts. Then after 5 or 6 wears, the right heel begun to make a squeak noise every time I took a step. While I could deal with the shoe being a little large, the heel squeak was a deal-breaker. Since the problem occurred within 30 days, I returned the shoe for a refund."
"Buying shoes on Amazon is a risk. If the manufacturer's sizing has shifted or if a batch of seconds is being off-loaded, you cannot return the shoes without incurring a charge.

These shoes may be quite good, but they were a size smaller than the other NB I own.  If you order, consider bumping your size up a bit.

The following is probably of little consequence, but it would have helped me avoid this particular shoe.  I did not notice online how much silver-toned plastic is used on this shoe.  It definitely would have been the oddest looking shoe I own (but then again, I'm kinda dull)."
"This guy has a great product but needs to get SIZING CORRECT.  Major issue with many women.
Had to return the 39 as too small, and then the 40 was way to big. Really??? Buy shoes all the time online
and don't see this type of size miscalculation.  There is a problem there."
These tend to run small and are not very well made. No padding in the crotch area so they are less absorbent when toddler has an accident. Colors fade quickly and are starting to come apart around the waist band. Green Sprouts brand held up much better. Even the Gerber brand held up much better than these. Would not buy again.
"Worst book bag ever. I read the reviews and decided to give it a go anyways.  It came with white fuzz all over it.  After 4 lint roller sheets,  I gave up.  It is flimsy,  has strings coming out of the seems, and is small.  At least it is a temporary thing for me at work since I broke my ankle."
It's a great design but too wide at the bust. Had to hand stitch it.
"Arrived broken and also not very flattering. More ""respect my authora-tie"" than ""talk to me goose""."
Pretty upset with this. I say so many pictures of females with smaller breast with this and it fit awesome on them. With me tho I order smallest size possible and it is still to big. I would only recommend to women who are bigger then a Bcup and bigger then a size 0 dress.
"I wear suspenders daily, and these unfortunately did not make the cut. Broke on second wear. Cheap construction.  Cannot even recommend for the occasional wearer since it broke so quickly."
These are skinny leg not a boot at all and the rest of the jean is huge everywhere.
Wow they really messed up the production of these socks. I got them for my 4 year old and they were way too tight in the legs. They did fit my 2 year old however so we put them in her dresser. They are so thin though I doubt they will last long. They really need to fix the cut of these so they'll actually fit like they're supposed to and make them with better materials so they aren't so thin.
Bought for friend's heavier child.  Way to small in bust and had to return.
AS THE DRESS STRETCH THE COLOR WILL ALSO.
"I did NOT buy this bracelet from Amazon, but from Macy's for my fianc's Christmas gift.  It IS beautiful.  However, the so-called lock at the magnets doesn't work well at all.  After it coming off a couple of times by itself, it fell off and was lost the very day after Christmas!  I am just sick about it as was he!  It truly is a gorgeous piece of men's jewelry, but I'd never recommend this to anyone with the faulty magnetic ""lock"".

SO disappointed.  And money lost completely for this item."
I got this bra in thinking it would be perfect but it was too big and the tips were pointy! Not a fan at all!
"Compared to the other to pair of Jerzee Sweats I ordered, these are a great disappointment.  They run extremely small and are much longer than the other two I purchased.  If it wasn't such a headache returning this Item, I'd send them pack to you in a heartbeat!!!!"
Medium torso is too short after laundering and shrinkage. Large is bloated like wearing a big sack. I am medium/slim/fit build and it fits as though for a fat person. Legs are billowing. Does not fit as the picture seems to suggest. Material is excellent. Zipper is jagged steel and very rough.
"Very disappointed by these, nowhere in the name or anything did it mention that these were held up by your fingers and so when they were on a flopped all over the place I was soooo upset. They would only be up if I had my arms up, which you can imagine was pretty tiring... and on TOP of that, one of the finger straps came not secure enough and snapped within an hour of wear.... yeah.... don't buy this......"
These shoes fit well and are comfy.  They are just too plastic like in material/construction to give anything more than 2 stars.
"I previously purchased one that fit great. This one is so tight its unbearable, and it says ""SPORT"" on the front. NOT AS PICTURED."
These don't fit very well on my face.  The eye holes are not quite right.
to expensive !! not what I expected !! :(
"One size should have been a caveat, but no, I bought this anyway.  It's very stretchy, feels like it's made of thick opaque panty hose.  Problem is, it feels like you're being choked by a midget while you're wearing it, as even the neck is small.  The sleeves are not long enough and shrink back up your arms, and the worst part of the fit is the hips-to-waist area.  The material rolls up your stomach as you move until your belly button is showing, forcing you to constantly pull it down.

I bought this for a costume; I'll wear it for parade day, but it will be going to the donation stack as soon as I'm done with it."
"Cheap quality. Did not like, never worn. Missed the opportunity to return"
I returned these items log time ago.
"I got these for my daughter for xmas, she was not happy.  The shoe slants inwards.  Very hard to walk in.  Too bad, very stylish."
Not for my little. I wear a size 5.5 and found that they sliped in my ballet flats rather than provide traction. They are low cut and for someone who doesn't mind the slip of nylon they may work. I found a cotton low cut sock that were more to my liking. Based on the ratings they work for most people...I am just a warm climate cotton gal.
terrible don't fit
I bought these for my husband. I purchased a 10.5 because that's what his Sperry loafers are. They were too small. Returned them and ordered an 11. This time the length was good but the shoe was too narrow. We both hated it because the leather is buttery soft. He just knew they'd be wonderful. Sorry but not going to order a third pair.
"Don't buy these. They will stretch out after about a month of wear. Mine are useless now. Initially I loved them, although they did feel a tad bit loose in the beginning. It got much worse the more I wore them."
Have this same shoe in black and love it and so comfortable. In this blue color the same size runs smaller??
This is super small was not happy... sent back asap
the way it goes sometimes with one size fits all. I will keep it and give it away.
Received with a hole in the fabric. Will be returning.
"I TOO I would have given it 4-5 stars but the cover for the handle WAS unglued THE day I got it. I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE HANDLE WAS CHEAPLY SEWN ONTO ITSELF SO AS TO HOLD THE BAG! The handle fasteners have plastic ends and the manner in which the bag opens SCREAMS ""DYSFUNCTIONAL DESIGNER""!!!"
"it crushed my testicles and gave me a moose knuckle, even with a size larger than I normally wear. These just aren't well made."
Not used nipples as marketed.  Way too small.
Pilled after first wear. Unusable now.
Looks good but it is hard to attach a watch to it. I can not use it.
I really like this top but it ran small and was not comfortable at first. So I used it as an excuse to drop a couple of pounds and now it fits perfectly.
It's way too tight
they don't fit as expected
"My first time using this boats and my feet got too wet inside... I can't belive in that. They are so beautiful, but they aren't waterproof."
"Been wearing flipflops for years.....these are inferior to previously pairs I've had.  Did the company sell or start manufacturing off shore?
Returned and will not reorder.  Very very unsatisfactory!"
I ordered this item last minute and didn't have time to return it otherwise it would have gone back that same day. The item was old and cracking (like dry cheap leather) I was afraid it was going break into pieces. I glued the pleather strap that wraps around the handle back since it was already coming apart. Over all hated the item but I needed it so I kept it.
Small. Very small. Eyelets rusted.
Not shaped like an hour-glass. Garment  is short and straight. Not possible to be a waist trainer.
These earring are so tiny!! I returned them.
"Super cute sandal, but the straps didn't fit right.  The toe strap was too big and gappy.  The straps are not adjustable, so had to return.  Bummer!"
"I got one of these recently and was in the process of opening it when I saw a ""Warning:  This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer"".

I figure it's probably lead in the PVC handles (who knows, it's not specific).  Just creepy and weird that a reputable company like Samsonite would ship a product with this kind of stuff.  I have returned it."
I love this fabric.  It has a nice flow to it.  But the pleat in the front and back is very unflattering.  I would love to see this fabric used in a dress in a better design (no pleat in the front or back).  Several of us in a group ordered this dress and it was unflattering on everyone.
insole had cushion for the ball of your feet that was not in the right place for me.  Returned the shoes.
"Very cheaply made. The lace doesn't go all the way around, and is only 1/4"" high, not like shown in the photo. Stretch out very easily, so they don't keep your jeans/pants down. And the white is actually an off-white cream color."
Nice box. Zipper broke after one day of use.
"Waste of money unless you've had your head shrunk! Too small, too short, hard to get on. Oh well."
"My husband has been wearing lee jeans for decades. This is the same name and the same description but not the same jean. The waist is enormously wide for a 34 and the whole style is more like 'no style' and no defined waist. On top, the legs and seat are also much wider than the earlier models and we don't even want to mention the material...
Ours are going back."
"The shirt came quickly being a prime item. The quality of the shirt is solid. The color is a pale pink. Not a loud pink. The shirt itself is nice, however, i ordered a 2X and received a 3X which is kind of a big deal. Too big."
"First off, this set is a dingy gray not white like pictured. It is not as long as in the photo. The mustache & beard don't lay correctly after being smashed in the package and even when trying to straightened out, you can't!
The wig is very thin and uneven in back. It looks like a hunk was cut out or something! You can see my dark brown hair through the wig, it is so thin!! Try another brand or something! If you want to look like a drunk Willie Nelson, buy this one! lol"
"I first ordered a size 9 and when they came in, I was disappointed.  They were smashed together and wrapped up in clear plastic.  When I got them out of the packaging, there were huge dents in the toes.  I popped them out, but the creases stayed.  I tried them on and they were too a bit too small, so I sent the 9s back and ordered size 10 thinking the toe issue might have been a fluke.  When the 10's arrived, I was disappointed they had the same packaging and toe issue.  I tried them on and they felt the exact same as the size 9.  These are not $47 shoes.  These are $5 shoes... maybe."
"these suck,"
"Arrived as scheduled, but the earrings arrived broken. The piece that the hook would securely sit in is broken so the earrings can't latch. I never opened the package. What a waist! Looking forward to wearing them with my batgirl cape for a superhero themed party for adults on 5/14/16.... Disappointed I am.  I'm an Amazon Queen!"
I wanted this to work. It was super cute and comfy. Sadly my cellulite showed to much
"I bought the same size I wear in the Lee Curvy Fit Maxwell Trouser.  The Rennie style in the same size is too small, by about 2 sizes.  The Porcini color is also much darker than it shows on my screen.  It looks like a shade of khaki on my computer, but the actual pants are a dark mushroom brown.

Other than these issues, the pants look nice enough, made of the same stretchy material as the Maxwell trouser."
Have another style of Miz Mooz ankle boots that I adore. Was expecting these boots to provide the same comfort and was surprised to find them utterly uncomfortable. Returned them immediately. The heel was also higher than I expected. Overall disappointed.
"I like it except for this:  it's such a thin chain that  the length of it causes it to become knotted and twisted when being stored.  Even being very careful putting it away it comes out with knots.  Takes forever to get the knots out, too!

UPDATE TO MY REVIEW:  I am changing my review to 1 star and would give it no stars if that were possible.  Although the chain is pretty, no matter how I store it there are knots in it when I take it out to wear.  I store it  flat, carefully doubled, in an open box that does not get disturbed, but when I take it out, there are at least 2 knots.  It is SO FRUSTRATING !!  I wish I returned it within the period allowed,"
The screw wouldnt stay screwed on. Finally ended up losing the ball so its garbage now
"Eeek. While the hold is great, the odor is overpowering. Given that it is a strong smokey/tobacco scent this will not be acceptable in a professional environment or even in an environment where one is working with the general population. I guess it smells like someone's elderly grandfather ... maybe something of faux wood paneled den with yellowing copies of This Old House/Popular Mechanics stacked in the corners. Nothing about this appealing so we tossed it after one trial run.

I guess if you work in career where tobacco scent is not a liability, and (for some reason) you find that scent appealing, this could be for you? Outside of trust-fund hipster babies, I cannot fathom for whom this is an appropriate, sexy option."
"A longtime fan of these boots has been sorely disappointed.  The snap broke after just four days of wear.  When they exchanged them for a new pair, BOTH snaps  were already broken in the box!  The sad part is, I still wear my old pair which I bought over six years ago and the snaps on those still function well.  Somebody dropped the ball somewhere."
"They look good, just be careful wearing it for too long as it will get humid and start to burn your skin"
This watch does not work. I do not know if it needs a battery or what. Will be sending it back or maybe a battery could be sent to me to see if that will work.
Very heavy with a large pin that will leave a hole in your shirt.
"Big Ugly as sin, shapeless, sleeves short - its cheap looking and feels cheaper, total waste of funds."
"Honestly - I used the size chart and even skewed to the larger size. These barely covered my nipples so obviously they did nothing at all to support the girls (even though they are mosquito bites).

Highly dissapointed"
"What an incredible boot! I have been a fan of Timberland for more years than I want to admit to! This boot just didn't fit. I ordered a size larger than I usually take but the side zipper still did not give me enough room to get my foot into the boot. Not even kind of. It was made well and just so beautiful but it was so tight and narrow I could not get my foot into it. So, sadly, I had to send it back."
"When I tried these on, the souls of 940,000 aborted Texas babies started appearing one at a time before my eyes. There was the baby they called The One, who was destined to cure cancer in 2048. There was the Angel Baby, who was going to lead the world's children out of hunger. Over there, I saw the aura of Cowboy Baby, the never-to-be future quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys, destined to lead them to 4 Super Bowl titles. In the distance was Save The USA Baby, whose future was to lead the country back to what the Founding Fathers intended. These shoes are indeed magic, in a haunting way. I'd avoid them."
Would not buy these again. The rubber loops should hold up to pulling the boots on. They had only been worn a few times before they both broke. I would have returned them if it had not been past the return period.
Long leg is longer than the other. About a good noticeable 1.5 inches. Embarrassing
"I may send them back.  They are just too big.  I wear size 7 shoes.  These are supposed to be sevens, but fit my feet like eights.  Also, in the picture they appeared to be adjustable, but they are not.  They are well constructed, and if they fit, I would love them."
"Definitely order a size down from what you would ordinarily select.  I determined, in addition, that the overall shape of the piece is intended for a different body type than mine (more for an apple than a pear, to be specific) and have returned it for a refund."
I wear size 38/30 so thats what I ordered.  I am pretty sure its sized for a man thats 34/30 or 36/30.  They are super small and the legs were really tight around my thighs.
i would not order again
Does not fit well..poor quality
"I only took one of he boots out of the box because  they were that ugly! They also run big, so just beware of the weird fit and unattractiveness of this shoe."
sleeves are VERY short... body of the shirt is also short. Might be okay for a short person?
I usually wear a size 6 1/2 M I ordered these in 7 and 6 1/2. They both were narrow and uncomfortable. I guess FRYE is not for me.
"Too big, I returned"
Pretty shoe and the heel height was just right. As soon as I put them on I felt where I would get blisters because the material its mae from is so hard. So unfortunately I had to return them :(
"They just lie and put a size but when you order that size it comes totally different, when i ordered it says it will fit small and medium, but no it does not fit small and medium its even larger than XL"
"I did not like anything about this bag, the straps aren't shoulder length let's just say this bag sucks!!!"
"Fair quality,not good!"
"Terrible quality, the logo and the number looks like made by a child. It does not fit as expected."
"I bought a larger size based on several reviewers stating it runs small.  In the future I have to view comments with skepticism, those shoes was way too big.  I should have gone with my instinct in regards to past Ryka shoes and stay within my size."
WAYYYY to small!
"About a half size too small, and cheaply made. I returned them. They had no padding, and were so flimsy and cheaply made. I mean noticeably, I have pretty low standards."
"I am a HUGE Timberland fan, this is the only brand i will wear because they are the most comfortable! However, these in particular i wasn't to thrilled with. They seem very big compared to all the other 11E boots i have went through in the past. They also seem a bit taller than your normal 6inch boot, due to the height of this boot, even leaving undone the top lace loops it digs into the front of my upper ankle, which is VERY uncomfortable...! I don't know if i will be able to get use to this, so i may just have to ship them back. I was really looking forward to having these, they are waterproof, composite toe, just about has all the good options you can ask for.  As for standing still they are comfortable but moving around is another story, I do wish they fit to my liking.."
I got peach & black... The peach is not peach it's light pink & I hate pink! These are very thin & see through material. You will have to wear something underneath them. Looks like I'm going to have to sew the shoulders a bit so you cannot see my bra straps. I usually wear medium size 7 but these run big. I wish I'd ordered small. It's a HUGE hastle to send things back & because of that I don't do it. I would not purchase again! Waste of money for the type of material these are made of.
returned these shoe - way too tight in across the toes.
The left shoe was perfect but the right was like a vice grip on my toes
"I ordered for my mother, and she had difficulty getting them on.  I also wear the same size and also had a very difficult time getting foot past the ankle area.
I had to return. They were a gift to my mother and hopefully we'll get our money back, as they were past time for returns allowed.  I will let you know.
Otherwise, beautiful boots. I know three other friends that wear them."
"BEWARE!!!!! Bootleg shirt. Screened on and bootleg color. Pics show this isn't an authentic brand. DONT BUY!!!!!! And delivery was TOOK FOREVER!!! BEWARE, DONT BUY!"
"too large for a xs size and its not what i expected not like in the picture at all,most of it for a man scrubs doesnt look good for a woamn"
"No recebi o produto de maneira correta!
Esperava receber o produto junto com a maleta, porm a mesma no foi envida!"
"Disappointed: All my shoes whether street or golf are 11C. I received slippers marked 11D that are at least 1/2 size short and too narrow. The leather looked very good, but very stiff.
I returned them for refund!"
Sent them back because too small and there were no larger sizes.
"Too wide, too squishy.  These could potentially cause someone to fall or twist an ankle. Soles are too thick and mushy."
"These are very uncomfortable. The straps are rough and irritating. They are way too long and drag against the ground. The heel bed is way too large. Overall,  I am very disappointed and I would not recommend."
Cheap and not enough elastic.
Dislike too small
"Product looks nice and I like the lunch box, but two months after school started the cover fabric is already tearing."
The shoes were not comfortable (for my odd feet) and the color was a little too pink for me.  I had to send them back.
"Fairly large even for a large, fabric color bleeds. It does not wear like the picture in my opinion. I maybe should have tried a medium."
"I am 5' 7"" 170lbs and am pretty curvy( especially in the butt and thighs) but with a small waist so I find it extremely difficult to find pants that fit without a gap in the back that shows my underwear to the world. They were uncomfortably small on me and I had a few sausage flashbacks. They also feel more like an extremely itchy spandex rather than a mostly cotton material. I will give it this much it did fit my butt without the gap once I finally managed to squeeze into them."
This bra is way too small for the size I ordered. I will be donating it.
They did not include the free bowtie.  Very disappointed.  Will call for this item.
"these were super tight and I don't have thick feet. they hurt, I had to get rid of them after 2 uses."
I returned them even getting a half size bigger did not help
"Would have given this 5 stars, but the two pairs I have received have begun to squeak about 2 days into wearing them...seems to be related to the inserts, If I take out the inserts from any of my previous pairs (I've owned 5 pairs now) and insert them...no squeak.  These insoles are orange...and different from previous ones...emailed Merrell 5 days ago and no reply so far."
Very cheaply made. Do not fit well@ waist. Made in Mexico. Very thin material.
"I couldn't get even get my foot into the shoe. I wear an 8.5 but my feet are wide at the toe. Not only are the shoes narrow, but they have no give. They didn't stretch at all. I immediately returned them to Amazon who issued me a refund the next day."
It say red. It is not red color
"This looked incredibly cute online, but when we received it, we found it to be a dingy white, and MUCH smaller than the size listed.  Unfortunate, because it would have made cute Easter dresses."
The quality is crap. The eyeball is made of plastic. I'm just going to throw it in the trash. What a joke and waste of money.
"Looking for a cheap cotton twill cap this is your choice. Looking for a cotton twill cap with a good form, this is not it. The band and cap are not like the picture, actually puffs out and looks strange. Tried washing it and getting a better shape out of it. All it did was get looser around the band and shrink the cap portion. Now I just wear them outdoors around the house to keep the sun off my head while working. Wife says, ""I look like an idiot in it""."
Did not fit my 3 motnh old with average head size.
"I have ordered this dress from two different sellers on amazon, and both times got the same wrong dress instead of the dress pictured. The dress I received looks nothing like the picture and is poorly made and cheap looking. very disappointing!"
Was not the correct size. I ordered a size 7 the size I have been wearing for years. The ring was really small. It fit like a 61/2.
A bit snug when you first wear it. The glitter design you see on there comes off instantly and all over your house and your hand and your face. This thing is cheap this thing was made in China. Don't expect quality here.
They are very short on my son. They only come up to mid calf. They are also not the color you see in the picture. More like a deep red.
"I GUESS FOR THE CHEAP PRICE IT WAS WHAT IT WAS, BUT I SENT IT BACK"
"they fall off,, terrible"
Damaged when received. Had a black. Smudge on the top of the boot that looked like a burn mark. The little hoop on the back of the boot was not connected properly and was just a string hanging off the boot rather than a hoop to hold the pom poms. Had to return.
My daughter is a 3T-4T in clothes right now.  I bought this dress in size 4T .... and it fits my 18 month old perfectly.  Terribly SMALL.
"The outer sole has peeled from the sides, disappointed. Now I wonder if they are China knock offs."
Good material but too big and ugly.
A little stiff ...and heel slipped when walking.
Ordered this for my wife & it's way smaller than expected.
Junky watch.  I got two of these are both do not keep time correctly.  I would not recommend!
"I got them to go outside in the yard and mess around...I am a size 6 women's and I got a big kid 6. They are pretty big, but I didn't want to deal with the return issue."
"Product is very bad and is Genuine Not worth a dime Beware of this<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U-S-Polo-Assn-Men-s-Classic-French-Terry-Short-Dark-Heather-Grey-Large/dp/B00K67BJ02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U.S. Polo Assn. Men's Classic French Terry Short, Dark Heather Grey, Large</a>"
Perfect waist but too low of a rise
"The shoe was the right size and color, but after use it for a little time y left them inside of my car and they shrink and now I cant not use them anymore, This happend now that I can not change them.  I am super angry about this.  Dont buy this shoes!!!"
Looks cheap way to big on stone for band size makes it look fake
"Boots came quickly, look really nice, warm, fuzzy...BUT the bottoms are of a very hard plastic. Good tread for snow, but when you hit solid floor they are SLICK! I ordered my normal size and they fit across my foot, but my toe was mashed in the front.  My mom has smaller feet, thought to give them to her, but bottoms are so slick I was afraid she would fall and break something.  I like the looks of this boot, but the soles need to change to a better grade of rubber."
"Very unhappy with this purchase.
This item description says ""made in the USA"", and lists the material as a rayon blend.
I ordered this in deep burgundy, but received a poorly cut light red polyester outfit made in China, not in the USA, as is stated in the ad.
The cut is wrong, the material is wrong, the color is wrong, and the description in the ad is dishonest."
WAY too small. Quality very low. Fit is NOT accurate!
I work in law enforcement. These don't work with the weight of the belt and don't do that great of a job. For regular clothing it might be better. Pretty expensive for magnets I might add.
"Super cheap quality. I never got to wear them. Granted, my kids broke them and I should not have let them get to them. But they would not have lasted anyway, these are super flimsy."
Cheap material and the color faded so quickly
"This bracelet is actually quite lovely and was so excited that it went on sale. The issue however is the length, measured out at under 7 inches and couldn't get it around my wrist. The information provided, says the length is 7 1/2 inches. This would only be true if you added on the 2 charms that are attached to the end of the clasp. This doesn't give the actual ""usable"" length. The picture is also very misleading as it shows the bracelet hanging way down on the wrist. Measure your wrist before ordering, if your small boned it should work for you. Returned unfortunately."
"Very cute, but can't handle a kindergarteners ""heavy"" school load. The seams between the 2 main pockets are completely shredded. We've had it 2 months. Only thing in & out of it is an almost empty folder & a small pair of shoes, if it can't handle that then it can't handle anything."
These are great quality and will definitely add at least one cup size. I originally purchased these to wear with my wedding dress - these were too big and heavy for that purpose however are great for day to day use when you can wear with a bran
NOT SECURE
"Bags tear WAY too easily...they're okay, but ultimately cheap. cheap. cheap. I've seen dust covers with better quality."
Got wrong item.  Style and size (too big) 
"I'm all in favor of businesses all over the world, including Asia, being competitive and also offering products at very fair prices but in all fairness Amazon should,...no it NEEDS to list clothing that is specifically labels ""Exclusive Asian Sizes"" and stop trying to cram larger persons from Europe, Russian and the Americas in XXXL Asian sizes which never fit correctly. AND Asian businesses need to make clothing specific to larger people. Are we to believe that there is no way for Asian clothing companies to manufacture garments for people with larger builds than Europeans Russians & Americans? The Asian styles are quite nice but I am 6'3"" and 210lbs and I do not fit in anything from Asia. I would advise anyone with a larger build to just avoid asian sizes all together. This is by no means meant as an insult to asian clothing companies, your stuff is very nice - just very small. In the case of this purchase I ordered the largest size available. Not only did they not fit, I ended up giving them to my 12 year old son. Please consider making  clothing in western sizes."
"neck - good
chest - good
long sleeve - elbow length"
Purse straps broke after a month
"Awful product.  So ugly and cheap.  I didn't even bother to send it back and there is no one who would have wanted it so I threw it away....after it was used to dust my house.
  Looks nothing like the picture and unfortunately I couldn't recycle it."
Turned skin green.
I ended up returning this. I didn't like the material and it looked very cheap. I ended up returning it. I suppose it would have made a good beach bag.
"Boot looked kind of weird, the tongue of the boot is not loose like a standard work boot. This is more of a slip on with a laces to snug it up. The leather looked very plastic. The size was about 1 size larger than stated."
"I'm not sure why this product received rave reviews.
They are good leggings; but they're of the same quality and wear as the $8 Target brand. Cheap, see-through, and because they run large and have very little spandex, they slightly sagged in the crotch and knee area by end of day. The wide waistband is good at  smoothing out any muffin top, however, I've had cheaper leggings with a wide waistband and a control top that do an even better job. In summary, don't buy these. They're cheap looking but cost a lot of money. Whoever says they aren't see through is lying or has bad eyesight."
Runs small was very disappointed
"Not a thick T shirt, in fact rather thin and shrunk on first washing. Looked good but won't last."
"It says 6-pack and I originally expected 6 black ones and got 1 black one and 5 grey ones and returned for 3 black ones that were OK Quality, however the grey ones were thinner and poor quality, not even suitable as rags. After washing them the grey fabric became something different, as if some of it dissolved away, and what was left resembled a somewhat crinkled up sheet of paper. Maybe I will post a picture later, words do not describe it. So the black ones are OK, they do shrink a lot, so I would recommend ordering the next size larger. The grey ones are of a different fabric and are junk."
"This is a beautiful bracelet at a great price.  I love gemstones and jumped on this when I saw it in my ""lightning deals.""  In fact, this was my first (and only) lightning deal purchase.  Unfortunately, the quality is lacking.  I received mine with a stone missing and one of the prongs to hold it completely broken off.  Is silver supposed to break like pot metal? I don't know.  I am disappointed to have to return this item.  File this under ""if it seems too good to be true (etc.)."""
The shirt was very cute. My size on the Amazon chart says I am a XL but I ordered a 2x just to be safe.  The shirt was more like a small or medium. No way it was even a large.
"I ordered this for my wife for our Mexico trip. She almost always wears a small but reading reviews I decided to order a medium for her... It was too small... So we wanted to return it, no big deal right? Well normally it wouldn't be but for some reason they wouldn't give us a full refund only half of our money spent would be refunded... If your not 100% sure on size or if you will like it when u actually put it on, I highly recommend u look for a company with a better return policy"
"The side of the glove tore after first time usage. And i didn't even fall.
Its not easiliy reworn if hand is sweaty, so its better not to take it off duting usage."
"I always wear a size 9, but after a mighty struggle I found these not only too small but simply unwearable.  There is an interior wedge of a very hard material in the heel.  Very disappointed, but I am well pleased with the pair of Bobs boots that I subsequently ordered.  They are not easy to get into either, but are very comfy and warm."
"More like slippers than bowling shoes.  They were extremely comfortable, but I may as well have been wearing a thick pair of comfy socks in place of shoes."
"These pants are NOT high waisted if you have a butt of any kind.  Evert 10 mins I had to pull them up so I didn't show my bum!  Order a size or two up of you are curvy.  Stretches to a white color, the blue doesn't stay blue."
Print is a little busy.  They do run a little narrow.  The styling is great.  If you are looking for bootie to wear just for fun once in a while it could be great for you.
I ordered these in Every size. Cute style. NONE FIT! Asians have no curves. Don't order if you look like a woman.
"The briefs were too small and in addition were filled with ""lint"" from the manufacturing
I washed two pair but were still ""UNFIT""  to wear"
"These boots are super cute and the sizing guide is very helpful.  Unfortunately, the top of the nail that connects the boot heel to the shoe is sticking up slightly in both boots that is VERY painful.  I wore them for one hour and had to take a splinter out of one of my feet.  The bottoms of my heels were sore for a few days.  Sad."
.loved the color but it was damaged and returned
These shoes run short and really really narrow in the heal. I couldn't wear my regular size or the next size up. Very disappointed in how they fit.
"Style and fit is good.  But quality is poor.  There are stray strands of thread and you can't really trim them for fear of a whole row of knits coming apart.  So while it looks good, I can to return it.  Good concept poor tailoring."
"The material is super silky, so the pants kept sliding down on my kiddo, which was rediculous because every 5 minutes he had to pull them back up. The material is very cheap and doesn't breathe well. Save your money and get something else! The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for fast shipping & the pattern on the fabric was kinda cute."
Causes headache for me so I gave it away...I do not reccomend!
"These pants look better online. The material is ok. But in my opinion, kinda scratchy. The material doesnt stretch as well as ..lets say compared to yoga pants its not that stretchy. The elastic band is an inch wide. After two washes, it twisted really bad. Took my 15-20 minutes to untwist it in the waist line. This product is not good for the full figure lady, imo."
"the next three jumpsuits the orange ,green and pink were the worst product I ever bought on amazon like I said before if I habt been down with a injury I would have returned them what a waste of hard earned money...very cheap all around gross"
"Garment looked good at arrival, but after first wash had tears on seams."
Both zippers on the main flap of the backpack broke off. This is junk!
trigger finger too small for me. They fit my wife though. they will be good for her when we are cutting fire wood.
"They were too small even though we ordered 2 sizes larger as suggested. We had to return them.
Gave it 2 stars for fast delivery and easy return."
Material is too wrinkley
these shoes run very much on the SMALL side.
Too tight for heads bigger than 23 inches in circumference.
"Terrible fit.
I wanted to love these shoes so badly, but the fit is just very off. Initially I ordered a size 7M but received a 7.5M, Amazon was helpful to exchange but it took quite some time to receive my replacement. When the correct size finally came I was so disappointed to find the fit was very off. The heel slides out constantly, I don't think sizing down will help. I was sad to see the lack of workmanship in these shoes, I expect more from Jack Rogers shoes, the quality just isn't there. These shoes are not worth the price. After hunting for months for cute black booties TOMS was the way to go for quality, comfort, and style."
"It's ok I guess, but WAY smaller than what the picture leads one to believe!  I won't be using it much!"
"warm, but they don't last"
Overall the quality is good but the size is way off. I normally wear a small or medium. I ordered this in a small and it was way too big and not Form fitting at all. It was super baggy. Very disappointed ! I returned it!
"Cheap material, rather stiff feel.

Poorly made.  Better choices elsewhere.

Cheap price...get what you pay for."
Just a large piece of nice rayon material -- which I have several scarves that appear identical to this..
"I'm 5'1 and 120lbs, I ordered a medium worried that it a size small would be miniature on me. Well turns out the dress is huge, like a big bag on my little body. The dress is very cute, I just wish the size fit like I expected. Also, the dress is a little see thru, so your probably gonna have to wear something under it or just make it a swim suit cover up."
It fits fine I just don't like being lied to the pic says made in U.S.A. When they show up it's made in China on it. Im only keeping it because I need it. A little known fact the U.S. is the only country that requires an item to state where it's made. The little know fact is that there is a place in china called (usa). At one time things made here said made in the U.S.A. . Now you find items saying made in (usa) . Is that company's way of trying to trick us into thinking it was made in the U.S.A.!!!!!!!
"thin material.  no double backing for frontal panel.  Very small
would not order again"
"Weird fitting tank top. Got a large hoping it'd be a little baggy, but it's tight in the torso and the straps are ridiculously long (and I'm 5'8"")"
I got the top in a size larger than usual but it was still too small so I gave it to my 18yr old daughter. Which fit her perfectly :(
"You definitely have two order a size up or two, the one I ordered doesn't fit. The material hardly doesn't stretch at all"
"Terrrrrrrible!
Bad quality"
"Sorry, but it's really hard to put on. seems well made but I don't use them."
Looks old.  Like your grandma would wear
"Turns after a day or so, broke my neck in a rash."
"This doesn't look like an armband- it's more like something I would use on drapes. While I like the design, I'm not sure I like the execution. The plastic piece noted as a feature is more like a bug, I would think, unless you have the intention of gluing something to it. While it's removable, it's inclusion seems odd- as if this piece was made for something else. It's also not adjustable, so buyer beware."
"Not very comfortable.  These underwear seem to crawl up and I do not like that at all.  They are pretty in color, but make you slide all over the sheets.  Not recommended by me."
"Too big. I ordered a small im 5'5 135 pounds and this is huge on me. And that's not even the worst part! This white lab coat is NOT a white lab coat. It's more like a windbreaker feel to it and the absolute worst part? It's texture is that wrinkled fabric that is supposed to look wrinkled! I am a professional for crying out loud. I cannot use a windbreaker coat with ""trendy"" wrinkles covering every inch of it. Oh - and it CANNOT be ironed. So complete fail. This is a photo of it after it's washed but it comes in the exact same way, wrinkled.. Keep in mind you can't iron it -and it's 100% see through"
"This is the worst shirt I have ever seen.  The dye was not set in the fabric so whenever you touched it or the shirt touched something else, a blue color was transferred from the shirt to whatever it touched.  My fingers, arms, neck, undershirt were all tinted blue!  It was horrible!  I don't know how any shirt manufacturer could sell such a product.  DO NOT buy this shirt!!!!"
Thin fabric. Would not order again.
Cheap!! Very cheap material
"This case was a waste of money, the clasp broke in a month"
"too long and too wide, this shoe is measured wrong!!  I was totally disappointed when wearing them.  TOO Wide and not enough cushion!!!"
"I did not receive the item I ordered and the shorts are see-through. I intentionally ordered a dark color for the main color with a light colored trim, but received light colored shorts with a dark trim. Disappointed! Fits as expected, though I am annoyed I must now go through the whole return process."
Looks manly!
You should make the pants about 30 in elastic with a drawstring.  That way they would fit hips and people could adjust the waist.  These were really tight in the waste and big in the hips.
"I am very disappointed in this ring, it has no shine at all. The stones are dull and look like old glass. Do not waste your money on this!"
does not fit like the regular version of this cargo pant... way too small compared to the original style.
Product was too small and unwearable.
I liked the design of this but the PVC plastic had a plastic smell that I didn't like.
It is very cute but buy up 1 or 2 sizes
"The soles are painfully designed.  I'm sure the idea was to permit water to escape, but it seems that these were designed on a CAD system without the benefit of having someone in product development actually walk a few miles in these painful shoes.  Not only are the soles painful for walking, but the heel also creates blisters; even with cushion socks.  All I have to say is: FAIL FAIL FAIL.  Perhaps most confusing is why these so-called amphibious shoes make my feet sweat worse than regular running shoes.  I cannot suggest anyone buy these shoes, since I've got blisters on my heels and soles from walking less than a few miles, and they make your feet feel sticky with sweat."
"This says it comes in three sizes but when I attempted to order it wouldn't let me choose a size. I should have turned away but I did not and ordered it anyway. Well it didn't fit because it wasn't the right size, what a surprise!

UPDATE!!!
After emailing the sender and trying to get a different size, I was told that I would have to pay for the exchange! WHAT? NO! I've already paid for the product and did not receive what I needed, there's no way I will be paying for a second one!"
"These are adorable, and functional. However, the heels break after 1-2 months of use.
Just happened to my 2nd pair.
Avoid at all cost unless you are only wearing once in awhile.
Too bad, they are so cute. :("
Shoes came scuffed & looked as tho it is dinged. I am very disappointed & won't allow my son to wear this shoes. Seems like an old product was issued & camouflaged as new
Too small. My brother couldn't get his foot in the boot. I even ordered 1 size bigger but still too small.
"The Shorts arrived and when I took it out of the package the front of the white shorts has black burn marks and the quality is really bad (strings hanging down)
I would not buy here again, really disappointed... even though the pictures are beautiful."
"So I purchased for the thumb-hole sleeves --- the material is thin and basically can be see-through. This definitely something you want to layer with... big drawback, the sleeves are so weird that the thumb-holes don't necessarily line up with where they should be --- you kind of have to twist it around, and in some cases ( I bought 3 colors) the thumb-holes were way too small.  So yeah the sleeves are awkward.  I am 5'2"" ---38D. I bought the large and it was too snug.  Won't buy again - cheaply made."
I'm keeping it but the elastic band that goes over the breast is awful!! I cut it out and it's a bit better.
The fit is tight from the crotch all the way up to the back!
"If you don't need support, if you're just looking to have a piece of cloth between your skin and shirt then this will work.  Pretty much what you see in the picture is what you get. It doesn't lift, it doesn't support, it's just there. Fortunately I don't need much lift or support but had hoped it would have a little bit of tightness that at least made me feel like I was being held."
"I am disappointed with the size. I have a small wrist. The watch band was still to large, I bought two bands. I hope to credit for one."
"Really really long! My son is average height, 5'8"". Not crazy tall, but he's 15. These are like capri pants. Plus, they look more unisex than the picture-- I guess that's because of the length. The perils of online shopping :("
I normally wear xl but ordered a 3 xl according to reviews and size chart and it was still too small. Seems very cheaply made also.
This arrived with the paint peeled off. Way too expensive for a POS accessory.
"JUNK! I'm surprised there are positive reviews. Paper thin, cheap fabric. When I saw the package was shipped from China, I knew the chances of it being cheap was great. I was correct! Please put on your description where your items are being shipped from. I wouldn't have bought and of course it's not worth it to ship it back!"
"junk, think Walmart sells these cheaper. crotch area was huge."
"The kid wore them less than a week and the shoe strings have already started to fall apart. Looks ridiculous. And they're extremely difficult to get on, as they're built as slip ons. Too tight and the shoe strings are garbage."
"This high waisted suit was not I was expecting. The too fit great but the bottoms were a bit snug. thia suit is made very very small. Sizes are way off. And the bottoms did not look like they did in the picture. The colors were different. That was a let down for me. I really liked the colors of the suit in the picture. That's why I bought the suit in the first place.

Overall I was quite dissapointed with my purchase. At least the top fit good."
"i should have returned them as soon as i got them was hoping i could break them in, but it never happen"
So tight my toes curled in.  Had to return.
"These shoes look cuter in the picture.  I wear a size 10 and my foot is on the wide side.  The length was perfect but the width felt sloppy.  The wool cuff looks better in the picture, I thought it would look stylish but because of the fit of the shoe it looks more like a slipper.  Other reviews mentioned the lack of arch support and I have to agree.  There is insufficient padding and no arch support, the back of the shoe should come up more, it has a flip flop quality.  The shoe is well made with nice leather and finish.  Unfortunately the shoe is too uncomfortable to wear to work or to do much walking in.  I kept them because I got them at an excellent price and it's easier to keep.  I will wear them with pants that cover the cuff and try to add some slip in arch support."
"These look better online than they are in reality. The black cat eyes are simply installed around a pair of sunglasses. They do arrive in a case, but be prepared to wait a month to get them."
Does not fit correctly.  I am returning the shoe.
It was beyond just a slim fit. The material appeared to be cut wrong along the back. The cheap material and light color also showed the pocket lines before I even put it on. Not worth owning.
"Thin enough to wear as a short trouser sock. Foot fit is good, but these socks are made for people with giant ankles! Socks don't stay up and I don't have particularly thin legs or ankles. Try Hanes lightweight comfortsoft ankle socks instead."
"I bought this product, and the lining started ripping after 1 use. I really wasted my money on this one.  Ad was very misleading, saying how sturdy and well-made it is. Big fat lie."
"My expectations were apparently too high on this dress. It looks nice, I like the design and the color but the fabric is very stiff."
"These shoes aren't even white at all! They're very yellowish off-white, which is only emphasized by the actual white elastic on the top/sides. Very ugly, nothing like what I expected. They will be going back."
"It's just a huge sweatshirt, it's not long, it was WAAAAY too baggy, and it has no curves. Other than that the collar was pretty cool...but would not recommend."
"These are freaking huge. I have small hands, yes, but there's at least 3/4 of an inch of empty space in each finger. Just FYI."
"They are nice, but really small."
"Whilst these sandals have adjustable straps at the front and arch, the centre criss-cross straps don't and I found them so tight I couldn't get the sandals onto my feet."
Cheap. Hood rat status. Buy your wife something nice.
it 's ok
"Crap top, bad quality. Fell apart after two washes - Fabric stopped hugging after two washes and lost all elasticity by 3rd wash. Its a rag in my house now."
More white then turquoise very very thin material
"It is not at all like a rolex, save your money and buy a watch that's worth $50. ~really wish it was better
The problem is that the watch is much smaller than expected and it looks/feels very plastic-like"
Clasp broke after a month of use...not sure if this is a defect or if it's just not a very good quality product :(
"Not happy with this backpack, ended up returning. It smelled HORRIBLE, like super chemically/PVC plastic type odor. Several spots on backpack had dirt stains. Sad because otherwise a super cute backpack."
"These might be fine for a tween or young teen, but for an adult?  Unless they have a spectacularly whimsy personality, no. They are not particularly well-made; they just look silly and cheap."
"Great sweater, but the stitching around the sleeve cuffs started coming apart on the sleeve after one wash. Now the elastic is starting to come out and the cuff looks funny. Expect better quality from Columbia. Disappointed."
"Run large, cheap material and unflattering shape.  Even for the price, not worth it."
I returned this one. Poor quality and cheap looking. Bought a difference case.
"Unfortunately, too small. Cute design but the pants are WAY too narrow. The top almost fits but is tight across the top area so it hangs oddly."
Very cheap and thin material... super stretchy
"I wish Asics would bring back the 2170s because every sneaker model in the GT series after that feels inferior. As a runner, I'm absurdly loyal to a shoe once I find a good one. The GT 2000's were the worst, the GT 2000 3 were about as close as one could get the 2170s, and I feel like the GT 2000 4 are a tiny step-up from the 2000 GTs. The toe box of the 2000 4 is very narrow especially for an Asics shoe (and I ordered wide width). They don't feel super supportive and my knees bother me when I wear these for a long run. I so wanted to love these! On the plus side, the colors look great and they are super cute. If you don't have a wide foot these would probably work out fine."
The headpiece is made cheaply. (READ: plastic is exactly like the vintage face masks from the 70s.) It was cracked in the box. Otherwise it's okay. My son decided not to wear it after I applied tape to the split. I can't return it. Sad it wasn't made better.
"Runs very small and I ordered a size up, it fit barely. but the worst was it broke before I ever really wore it. The rubber piece to hold the thigh high popped off right away. :("
even after changing to larger size still snug
"The sizing on the top and bottom not consistent.  The bottoms are tiny (I bought a large and I am a size 6 in pants) and the top would fit someone with C or D cup breasts.  However, the quality of the suit was nice.  The material seemed sturdy and the colors were bright and pretty.  It's a shame that the sizing is so ridiculously off.  I sent it back."
"I ordered an extra large...it is so small it might not even fit my 8 year old. Thought maybe I got something wrong but it says ""men's adult"" so I have no idea why it is so small! I'm really disappointed as I ordered it so we could go trick or treating as a ghost buster family. Looks like I'll be the only one not in costume."
It was a defect!
"Larger fit than I was expecting; no arch support at all. The ribbed texture on the top of the flip-flop was nice. Overall, these flip-flops are overpriced for the quality of the product and I would not re-purchase."
"waist is too high.  also there is elastic in the ""shirt"" at be neckline in the back.  It causes the back to pull up. Uncomfortable.  All the negative reviews a right."
Too small and I was so disappointed! They are adorable shoes!
Was good for the winter could wear shorts underneath because it stayed warm but the zipper broke and I had to rip it off because it was stuck in the middle and split so threw it away
"Too much trouble to return them....probably my fault for not realizing how incredibly thin they are....and not paying attention to reviews saying how difficult they are to put on.  Have worn earrings for over 50 years and am unable to put these on....I have 4 holes on one ear and i cant get it closed on the top one, where it needs to be."
Lift my arms or bend down and I fall out of it.  Cups are too small.  Not recommended.
"I bought it for my mom and it was too tight , now it's just there lying around.  Wast of money."
"Fell apart within days, got a refund."
CRap!!! Bought 2 pair ...ripped both pair same place!!!
"I ordered the largest size available in this shirt, USXL, and when it arrived it is in reality about a medium size.  Sent it back to Amazon immediately and did not reorder."
This broke before it could be worn
"I have other Docker D2 pants.  The ones I just purchased, and returned, had legs that were at least 1  inches wider that other I have and felt a little baggy.  Now, all my others were 100% cotton and the pants I just purchased and returned were only partially cotton.  I don't know if that makes for the difference and I am not sure if I will order others just to see.  It may be easier to go to a store to try before I by.  I do appreciate Amazon's ease in returning this purchase."
"Your sizes must run small.
They don't fit well."
"Maybe if you live in a cold climate, but for hawaii it's too hot. Also fits too long for me. If you are tall and live in a cool climate, go a head and buy it"
"Item looks too synthetic.  Payless, Champion sneakers don't look this bad.  Came coated with a white dust made them look grey.  Too cheap looking.  I am contemplating returning them, unless my son decides to keep them..."
"Even though it's very light, there's no support and stability in the sides so it flex a lot when I cut sideways. Also the comfort is nowhere near what adidas has to offer so it's hard on your feet."
"The left shoe fit fine but the back strap on the right shoe didn't come close to fitting my foot, it was too long, so I had to send them back."
I ordered a two pack and only received one shirt.
The run somewhat large.
Poor quality. Looks like a cheap slip. So see through and thin. Can't wear body shape wear because it's so thin you can see right through. Worse item of clothing I've ever purchased on Amazon.
design of dress was not like the picture advertised
"This is a cute shoe and looking at it you think it will be comfortable to wear.  I got this shoe to replace my Gel Nimbus 15.  They don't even come close to the fit or feel of the old shoe.  Its much more narrow and shorter than the older shoe as well.  I put them on and walked around my house for about 10 minutes before my feet started to really ache.
I have also noticed that these shoes run small.  Always have...I normally wear a 10 in shoes, sandals and boots but I have to wear an 11 in Asics.  And apparently those aren't big enough either.  I now wear a 11.5 comfortably in Asics and still wear a 10 in normal shoes.
Note:  I did find that the Asics Gel Evate were very similar to the old Gel Nimbus 15 and haven't had any problems with them or my feet since I started wearing them.  I walk about 5 miles a day 4-5 times a week."
"I ordered 2 packs of 6 socks.  I got 1 package with 6 socks, and 1 package with 5 socks.  The plastic bag with the missing sock was slit open and the plastic tab that was supposed to keep all 6 socks together was gone.

Until you send me another pair of socks to replace the STOLEN sock, I'm going to continue to give you BAD REVIEWS.

Thanks for listening (if you, in fact, are)"
"Very pretty. Classier than expected.
I am editing my earlier review to include the fact that after one day of wear my ears were very irritated. I can't wear costume jewelry so I'm thinking these earrings aren't sterling silver or even surgical steel. Buyer Beware."
Didn't work on my polo shoes. Dont waste your money
"dreadful quality. Not in the slightest bit green, but instead they look like grey fake diamonds. The lever back barely covers ones ear lobes. I paid 10.00 and find them lacking at that price....should have been in the 1.99 batch of junk jewelry."
I have and old pair of these jeans that fit perfectly. The pair I ordered were the exact same ones but didn't fit at all. I was very disappointed.
These are nice and light weight but looses that value due to having to wear heavy socks they also have close to no support and end up being uncomfortable.  They are heading to goodwill even though I have only wore them one or twice.
"I chose the socks because they were a higher % of cotton than some other comparable ones.  They are very thin.  But the biggest issue is that I'm a size 7 1/2 and they are too small--slip right down into my shoe when I walk.  In other words, not usable."
It's incredibly small. My two rings barely fit in there.
"I would not recommend this brand to anyone, material. fabric is of poor quality, not as advertise. Disappointed with my entire purchase."
"The pictures made me think this was a spacer fabric; it is not. It is unlined. On me it is the wrong shape; the cups should be fine but cuts into the top of my girls even though there's extra fabric below them. Also the horizon position seems wrong, like the cups are set too wide for my frame. I look odd. I ordered the size (34I) that made sense based on how an older bra in the same brand fits now. Returning, not bothering to try another size."
Never had a bad pair of aerosols but this one is bad. Thin leather.  Fit is larger than expected
Prongs not set right so it catchs and scratches
The robe is undersized.  It was advertised as 2X-3X and was at best 1X.  Very tight in the shoulders.  Material of mediocre quality.  Sorry folks.  I returned this one.  My first return on Amazon after years of business.
Not sure what this was treated with but I've worn them twice and both times within 20 minutes I started to feel tingling and numbness in my hands and arms.  Pass on these and spend the extra money on Etsy.
The color green was spread all over the cream
This handbag was ok it was was a little on the small size.
"I was shocked when I received these shoes that they were so flimsy that when you stood up in them, the top of them sank in and got deep furrows horizontally across the toe.  In addition, the middle of the shoes gaped out as if you had your fingers in them pulling them out sideways..  All in all, they looked like clown shoes.  They told me to return them directly to them with a note and they would refund my shipping costs but they did not.  I sent several emails and they ignored me."
Really small and didn't fit. So my 3 year old wears them. But they are very cute
"Was too long, like really long...Material was nice though...big up top, tighter throughout...seemed cheap."
"The sunglasses are very poor quality.  I think they are made for a child.  The nose piece is not smooth and hurts my nose.  The lenses are foggy to look through.  Only buy these if you are wanting ""costume jewelry"".  I will not be using these sunglasses.  The sunglasses did not arrive in the same colors as the image."
Way bigger than description
"The insert has the wrong dimensions. The part that is supposed to fit into your checkbook cover is too small, which causes the entire insert to stick out of your checkbook.

I suppose you can flip it around, and stick the blocking part in the back instead. But if you do that, then you end up with the small back to protect your checks, and it doesn't even cover the check 100%.

All in all... useless."
"Complete lies all around for this boot. The material is unforgiving. It's cheap and I've seen better shoes come from the local discount shoe store. They are almost impossible to get your foot into and don't even think about pulling them up without a struggle. I was so disappointed in these I sent them back immediately. NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ANY PRICE. There are better options, keep looking."
"Handkerchief material
Wicked small"
Way too small - 1-2 sizes too small!
"I am returning these.  I thought I'd love them, but they are quite stiff and the toebox has an odd elf-like point on it.  I normally wear a 6.5W to 7. I bought a 7 and they were too long AND they made my feet look huge.  Not at all what I was hoping they would be.  Bummer."
It looses its shine 2 days later I was very dissapointed
"These were a gift for my wife.  They are definitely over-sized but look at the picture.  I'm not going to tell you that if you think you're stylish you shouldn't but someone closer to you probably should.  They're big red floppy booties.  My wife says they're comfortable enough but the 'nonskid' part is pretty misleading.  'Skid resistant'?  Maybe.  They're very slightly less likely to 'skid' then a regular pair of cotton socks but to call them 'nonskid' is a giant leap.  And that's if they're on your feet perfectly.  Because they're so over-sized, for someone with small feet like my wife, it is entirely possible for the primary contact area with the floor to miss most of the 'nonskid' surfacing put on these. The main reason I give them 2 stars is because of the false sense that they give.  While it's not likely to cause people to take unnecessary risks, it could create enough of a false sense of security to not be as mindful as you should be.  Other then that, my wife says they're comfortable enough."
"Returned thes boots!  Both too small calf , could not zip, and boots smelled like gasoline.  Price was too good to be true.,,"
"Ok guys, these are not real Polo brand. Their are Polo stores with great products. I'm in California and there's a store at my mall. They have great quality footwear. These are fake. My husband got me these not knowing they were fakes because he know I like the brand. They are as hard as cardboard, so uncomfortable, the worst material possible and the dye from the fabric runs right through the shoe within a few days just sitting in the box. Do not buy these is you care about comfort, fasion, quality or if you love your feet at all. I've learned to only buy items sold and shipped by Amazon, not other sellers. Though I will give in to a certain piece of clothing to see how it goes, but not shoes.  Here are a couple pics that don't show how red it really looks in person, but it is turning red on both sides in all the white area. I also saw this in some other reviews. Shop well. :)"
"Don't be misled to thinking that these are slim and trim versions of Dockers.  Even the D1 versions of these are only slightly slimmer that the usual cut.  The leg openings are a wide 8.75"" measured flat.  That's 17.5"" around.  You could put two feet into that space.  These are NOT slim, slender, trim, or anything like it.  They seem just like regular dockers to me.  Which makes me wonder what the Regular versions of these are like now.  Tree trunk legs?  NOT recommended."
"I ordered small, but I received Large! Dont they double check the order details first?! So disappointing!"
Faded after first wash. Length shrunk as well.
The shoes are of poor quality and the soles are so stiff that the children are reluctant to wear them
"The ad says leather not ""man man top, leather bottom."", I'll give it a week..."
"These fit as I expected in the shoe part, but they were so loose around my calves that they just looked weird and baggy. I didn't care for the style at all so I returned them."
This is for teenagers not adult size
Product felt cheap and always had a chemical smell even after washing. I guess you get what you pay for...
"Very flimsy chain - disappointed , would not recommend - when I opened to gift wrap for my granddaughter the chain was badly knotted - I could not send to her , had to purchase another chain with ' prime ' delivery to get to her in time for her birthday .."
"These will shrink in the dryer like you wouldn't believe.  They were true to fit before washed, but even when dried on low temp, they shrank up into high waters!  I haven't been able to stretch them back out."
"This hoodie is lacking a drawstring, thereby making the hood totally useless. Why would they design a hoodie without a drawstring, an integral part for full function? Next up, a shirt without a neck hole. When I contacted Columbia, they seemed clueless."
arrived too late for my vacation and when I got back from the glasses were as expected
"I read the comments before I bought this shoe and several ladies said to get a size bigger than you normally wear.  I figured a half size should do it as Clark's has never disappointed me in fit.  I had to return the half size bigger shoe and ordered a full size bigger.  I am not sure I can wear these, either!  There is no toe room in the design of this shoe!  I love the shoes, and they fit perfectly except for squishing my toes.  Big disappointment!"
"These are poor quality, but I wasn't really expecting much considering the price and based on the other reviews. I don't know that I would call them double sided, more like so thin that pattern is visible from the wrong side of the fabric. Some of mine were perfectly square, but most are far from it. Some sewn well, others had stitching falling out after the first wash. I just needed these for a costume party so they served their purpose fine."
Very small. Excellent delivery time. Good Amazon seller. Highly Recommended.
too small and horrible fabric
"I've worn Warner's wirefree bras for years, but my size has changed and I find I am needing a bit more coverage and support as I get older (*sigh*) so I've been trying out several styles on in local stores over the past month or so.  I must say before I begin that I absolutely HATE shopping for bras!

This bra was a style that the stores in my area didn't have in my new/correct size (36D) so after reading reviews on several websites, I ordered one here on Amazon (best price by far).

The bra looked well made with quality materials upon first inspection, and the band fit was right on...but the one I received had a very stiff scratchy edge on the back hook/eye placket that was irritating on my skin. Another problem was that the thick bottom band kept rolling up under the right cup, and I only had the bra on for a short time, so I knew it wasn't just something that was going to happen after all day wear.  Not comfy at all.  Also, the cups were a bit stiff, not at all the soft/stretchy lightly padded ones like on other Warner styles I've had; and if you got a chill, everyone would know it, if you get the drift.

Thankfully the seller I purchased from has a good refund policy (I always check that before I buy, and leave the tags on while test driving) so I shipped it back and although I am still awaiting my refund from Beall's of Florida, I'm sure it will come through eventually.

I have found a different bra from Warner's that I like, their ""No Side Effects"" bra, and although they don't make it in my exact size, I purchased it in the ""sister size"" of 38C and then took in the band on each side to adjust the fit.  It worked out pretty well but sadly, taking in the band did flatten the cups a little more than I was expecting.

However, I have to say that the BEST, most supportive, comfortable wirefree bra I have found to date is the Maidenform Comfort Devotion #9432, which I had to purchase online to try as it too is not carried in local stores.  It has soft, molded cups, and for me the size L fits perfectly, with more comfort, support, lift and enhanced profile than any of the other bras I've tried in my search, with just enough padding in the cups to hide the chills.  I hope that all the different colors I ordered will fit the same as the first one I purchased..(it's a mystery to me why the bra in the same make, size and style can vary in fit from color to color..)

The only ""problem"" I've had with this bra, which is not problematic enough to me to make me not like the bra, is I find that the wide smooth bottom band tends to bunch up a bit under the cups after you wear it awhile, especially once you sit down or hunker forward reaching for something.  The band is very soft however, so it doesn't irritate me or squeeze my rib-cage uncomfortably, but I did want to mention it.

Best wishes in your quest, ladies!"
"The other reviewers are right, this is not as pictured. The waist reaches to the belly button. Really too bad. Other than that, it fits great, but with the waistband so high is slides down and bunches up around the hips, which is uncomfortable. I will not buy this again."
Straps didn't adjust or it wld have fit good.
These are painful to wear. It hurts on the fees too much
These are garbage made of plastic definitely not a walking shoe like they say
Way too large.
The clasp keeps coming off! I'm afraid I'm going to lose it! Does anyone have any suggestions?
I did not get this product at all.
I didn't realize there Would be glue on the back. The one I tried to order didn't have that. But your site said that brand was discontinued.  I don't think it mentioned the glue on the one I ordered.
My ears were sore and swollen in less than 2 days....abnormal for my ears. Plus the large backs were uncomfortable to sleep in.
"I really wanted to like this dress. While the photo of the dress makes it look like a festive Christmas red, the dress definitely is the ""Lady in Red"" Dress... not an issue, actually. I was hoping it would be brighter.

My beef with this dress is two-part:

1. The nice ruffled skirt was badly wrinkled and misshapen. Because the fabric was so stiff (probably from the sizing chemicals they use to pack it), the only way it could possible lay that way would be to dry clean it... but again, the fabric seemed like a heavier-duty canvas cotton, so probably no pretty ruffles without intentionally ironing it like that.

2. Instead of being sewn in that shape, that lovely braided fabric bodice that shows in the image is held together by a few stitches. I'm a bustier lady in general, so it did not look anything like that photo once I had it on, rather looking more like a weird braided pretzel sort of thing than a lovely stitched pattern.

I really wanted to love this dress... it was just unflattering and not good in many ways."
"The leather straps are very wire, and the clasp is strange. It fits very very loosely, and looks strange because the straps don't stick together like the picture. I had to modify it myself in order to even think about giving these out to my friends, or wearing one myself."
"I want to be fair in rating this, and if there were half-stars I'd give this 2.5 stars. The issue here is entirely about fit. A person of a particular shape might find this very good.

The material is strong, and the fabric is pleasant to the touch. I like the design and the color.

The problem is that it does not fit my frame as expected. I have typically had good luck ordering shirts through the mail. I am 5'6"" tall and typically do well with regular fit shirts. In this case, the shoulders are oddly wide. It's therefore uncomfortable and looks kind of strange. If there's one thing I know about fashion it's that the fit is the most important aspect. A smaller person wearing shabby clothes just looks short and/or sloppy. If I had tried this on in a store, I would have immediately put it down and moved on. Maybe someone with broader shoulders and who is perhaps a bit taller would have a better experience with this shirt."
"I find it very difficult to put it on.
U have to put the back piece first which was a headache."
Had to return it as there was a hole in it.
"This watch was not for me. It was impossible for me to see the face, and it has a  high degree of difficulty setting it up. I guess if you're extremely techy, you might like it, but for the average consumer, thumbs down!"
Great shoe. Love it but it was left at the wrong house. A neighbor two blocks over brought it to my house
"So glad this came, put it in my little glass jewelry box that I use for various very small findings and whaddya know, it is completely tarnished before I even get to use it. Imagine what it will be like on your neck. Steer clear."
"This item sounds great and I got it thinking it would give me easy access to essential items and not look large or bulky.  It expands as the advertisement says. . . towards the bottom.  But at the top where the zipper is it's pretty inflexible.  So you can put items in there and it's harder to actually get to them because of the top.  There are compartments. . .if you will, but they are mesh so my rings and bracelets get snagged pulling things out or putting them back in.  It's just not what I thought it would be.  Works great for my 15 year old daughter.  She seems to like it I suppose.  I just couldn't find it functional.  I would not recommend this item for purchase to friend or foe."
The right shoe fell apart at the toe and the inside step location. The left shoe is still perfect. Im guessing a defect??
"Usually I am a perfect fit in the size that I ordered. The cups on this were too big. The 2 layers of material on the cups were not smooth. I was surprised, because Bali used to be a good fit for me when I was smaller busted. Wacoal really works for me, but it costs so much more. I did not experience support, and it sure made my figure look worse than with no bra at all.  The material itself is very comfortable. Maybe Bali works better for smaller bosoms. I will need to return this. It did take rather a long time for delivery, too, but arrived on the last day of the span of days for estimated arrival."
"Rats!  The beautiful starfish has fallen off one of them - I have glued it on - and good as new -

It's much prettier than the picture !"
This is  not wine color . It is red . I do not like the material.
spandex so cheap
Brown one broke after a few weeks. When the black one breaks will go back to my old watch chain.
"Pink is not really pink, it's reddish pink, runs quite f2f larger than sizing chart, very disappointed"
"IF these are really Gold Toes brand, then they are all seconds, hence the low price. I'll fitting, threads loose etc. Do not buy."
"This dress didn't fit my frame; I'm 5'6"" 110lbs and it ruched in odd places and hung strangely on my thin frame. I had to return this."
Too small. Didn't fit me and I'm a size large top. Cute though!
"The color of the boot is lighter than the picture it looks more brownish. Also the boots are not confortable, a little higher than what I expected I usually wear high heels"
Doesn't glow
"Very pretty, BUT does not hold well together. After a couple weeks of wearing it, it fell apart which means everything in it was lost."
The credit card slots are too tight and the dollar bill compartment is too small. Not happy.
I loved this belt but sadly after wearing it twice it fell apart :(
"Bought this for keeping Apple Watch bands in. It serves it's purpose somewhat, but the elastic is too narrow for most clasps. It's a real pain to get the bands in and out with the exception of the sports bands or loop bands."
"Based on the previous reviews, I was surprised to find the jeans  1. Running small  2. Too short. 3. Dorky.
I'm 5'-9"" and usually between an 8 and a 10, so I ordered the 8 because everyone said they run large.  They only got on because of the spandex, and they were too short, especially since I was hoping to fold up the bottom hems for fun. Most people said they had a great fit. Completely dorky/unattractive on me! Oh well. Thats what I get for ordering jeans online!"
Plenty of length but to tight in the body
Smaller then expected...didn't fit like picture
Great bra but runs very small
This is similar to tube socks with no heel - just one long tube with some kind of vinyl for the foot pad - the non-slip feature is a bunch of vinyl dots.  I would not order this item again.  What I had in mind was the familiar sock knitted onto a leather sole of some kind.  Very unsatisfactory.
It looks pretty but does not look natural under clothing. The lace that lines the botton was itchy to me and the bra was huge. I ordered a 32C and it felt like a 36C. Based off other customers' reviews as well as my own personal experience I would say that the sizing isn't consistent
way too big (I'm 5'7 and a size 8) and poor quality
1 star means ZERO! The fit is small...no biggie. I see that from the size chart. It is cheap...sure...i expect that too. The fabric print is HORRIBLE not AT ALL the color shown!!!! Solid prints in these are true to color and work out great but do not get a print or specialty fabric! The return process is painful and annoying!!!! Probably won't ever get my money back. Will think twice before ordering these again. I'll have to see if the seller is the difference.
very disappointed with this purchase it looks gaudy and cheap in person i will never wear it. Might put it on a key ring or something.
"No way will I purchase Boulder Creek again and have to pay for their mistake. I don't care what anyone says.. THIS IS NOT A PARKA.  This is a thin jacket that came in a small box and was supposed to be a 3X but was like a 7X for crying out loud.  There is nothing thick about this wind breaker, which is all that it is. Then it took two weeks after sending it back to get refunded...and they charge a $7.50 fee due to their mistake.  Don't get me wrong.. ordering one size too big or small is one thing.. but this thing, despite being a 3X could have covered a 900 lb person with ease.  You want to make the same mistake as me, god right ahead and order away.  Or you can go to an actual brick and mortar store and TRY ONE ON."
This is a child's shoe.
"This dress smelled like....I don't even know where to begin. I have never smelled anything so horrible before. It was like someone farted and sprayed chemicals at the same time and bottled it up in a rubber container for a thousand years. I had to air this dress out for 2 weeks outside on a clothes dryer before I could stand to try it on. And even then it STILL smelled faintly. So I had to wash it twice before I could try it on.

I am a petite 32B and wear a size 25-26 in jeans, and I ordered a small. I should have ordered an XS, but this dress did not hug my body or look sexy at all. This dress looked like a sad loose joke on me. It gave me flashbacks of those painful budding misfit adolescent/junior high school years all over again."
Not same as photo. They are more like Capri pants. And are made of cheap Halloween costume fabric.
"I decided to take my chances when purchasing this boot from eBay because it seemed like a great deal ($230), and said the boot was made in Italy. When I received the item it turned out the boot was made in Brazil and I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT! But I thought it was so cute, that I would keep it. Well, the boot does look nice and I agree with the reviewers who say that the almond toe shape is flattering and that the cut of the boot is very nice overall. When you put it on, however, you realize how stiff the leather is. Not only did it take me a few times at the cobbler to stretch the shoe at the calf and toe areas, but the leather sole, which is quite thin and would NOT hold up to the city streets, had to get patched up with rubber (I did this before I ever wore the boots out). Well it is now only a few months into the season that I have been wearing these, and the sole is COMING APART! No. Just no, Loefler Randall. Why did you have to outsource production to Brazil? Your brand used to be so amazing."
The bottom piece is good. Wide band across is nice. The fabric feels nice to the touch. The top piece has a strange fit. The boobs don't fit in there correctly. I ordered it in L and it was still too small.
"Fabrication is good, the size is way, way, WAY off! I'm going to pass it onto a very slender 12 granddaughter.
What was I thinking, right? I wear an 8-10, like an XXL or an XXXL in this type garment?

Lesson learned."
Poor quality. The lining of the bra was stiff. Fit was good and was sexy but returned it due to the quality
Poor quality would not recommend broke the band broke after using it in 2 weeks. 
"These boots were cheap looking, couldn't get my foot in - I ordered size 9 but I actually wear size 8. Very narrow shaft.  Not even white looking, had yellowish/dingy look to them.  I certainly do not recommend them to anyone..don't waste your time or money!"
"I purchased this as this was the only larger size minion costume for women. The fit was a little snug at the hip and way too lose in the upper body. The material is okay. Nothing special. It has a velcro clasp in the back versus a zipper. It's a thin material. I didn't like the fact that the costume's ""skirt"" part of the dress flares at the hips instead of the waste. It accentuates the wrong area. I wish the flare part of the dress was higher. Or it would just be better without any flare. The packaging was damaged. The bag was already ripped at the bottom and it wasn't put together very nicely. I returned my purchase because of the large sizing and my dislike for the flare part of the dress."
"How is a handkerchief just four dollars if then the shipping and handling is another four dollars. Someone is not being truthful, imo."
Not true to size..to small!!!...But I would love one that is!!!
returned.  It was to large.
My daughter didn't like them and neither did I. The band doesn't say on the hook and it's very hard to switch out the matching bezels. It's sitting in the closet collecting dust.
"First problem: I ordered a 30H in Black - they shipped me a 30H in Skin.
Second problem: the cups run EXTREMELY small. The bra is least 2 cup sizes too small, and does not fit as their size chart indicated.
Third problem: it's very unflattering. Part of that is the size issue, I'm sure. But a different size probably won't change the fact that it's a bullet bra.
Lastly, the item was marked as having Prime shipping (2 days) and it took twice that to show up. I'll give them a break since it was ordered around Christmas, but it's still disappointing.
The only GOOD thing about this bra is that the construction and materials are if excellent quality. Otherwise, I'd be tempted to give it even less stars. I am DEFINITELY returning this."
I don't recibe the shirt
"I bought the socks because the customer question on the page said they had no toe seam.  In fact they do.  In addition they are rather thin.  With all the high quality sucks out there, like Bombas and Vybe, there's no point in buying any inferior socket unless you are simply in the market for the cheapest pair possible. These are neither the best nor the cheapest."
They are pretty. The support is vionic great. But the front toe thong is awful. I only bring these for pedicures.  They are basically unwearable.
"have a very high arch so I wear a 10 1/2 EE in a normal shoe. I ordered these bigger by suggestions.
so I got 11 1/2 4E.
NO WAY they are 1/2 size too long but are still like a D width.
I guess they need to either make a 6E or learn what E means."
"The straps on this dress were not wide, so many of the styles shown in the photo (different ways to wear the dress) were impossible, since those configurations require the straps to be wider. It's a shame. I really wanted to like this. Returned it."
I ordered 8.5 the shoes are really wide and too big. Don't like at all.
"Nice shorts, but I am 5'10 and they go way over the knee. Not like the photo."
I wish I didn't have to check a star. They are NOT ladies or women leggings. I'm 5'2 and they only came up to my knee when fully pulled up. They don't have any stretch in them. I couldn't pull them up because they were super tight around my ankles and calves. If you have a tiny daughter then she can wear these.
"I ordered these for a college ballet class. They look like they are made of great material, and came quickly, but way too big, because I have wide feet I thought I would get a wide 9 or 9.5, as I usually wear a 9. I couldn't wear them they seemed like they were two sizes too big. I had to go and just buy a pair from payless so I'd have them in time for class."
Uncomfortable at the back of the ankle because of the rear zipper.
"Update: I took the watch apart, it seems that a small piece of foam is used to wedge the battery in place. This foam had slid on my watch rendering the battery lose. The battery was not dead. I simply taped the foam back into place and now the watch is working again.

This device came with two extra batteries in the box, that should have been the first red flag. I programmed the time in the watch and  then put it in my watch-box. Within one week, without wearing, simply sitting in the box and the had battery died."
I only paid about 25.00 for these shoes and thank goodness for that as they are flimsy and cheap looking.  No support on the sides and insoles aren't supportive.  I'll have to put a memory foam sole in there and there is plenty of room as they run large.  The silver decoration looks like it could pop off at any time.  I have a lot of Skechers and these are just not up to their usual quality.  If I'd paid the regular price I see on the site now which is about 68.00 I'd be returning them immediately.  LATER:  I wore these for my volunteer job at the hospital and when I walked on the hard floors it felt like there was nothing between my feet and the floor.  Thinnest sole I've ever seen on a shoe.  I wish I had my 25.00 back.  Just now on the site I saw a much smaller pair for 19.00.  Don't waste your money.
Wrong color and material was so cheap looking
Not at all what they look like.
This was extremely small...I had to return it.
too thin / flimsy
I was looking forward to wearing this but it fit a bit large and just did not look right. I had to return. Looks better in the picture
A little bit longer than I had hoped. I bought Polo's a long time ago and they weren't as long as these. But unfortunately they'll have to do.
I like this ethnic design. But this one had a strong chemical odor and many strings left around bag. You have to clean it up before use. Is this worth for the money? I say for me... not.
Felt very cheaply made. Almost disposable.
I ordered this shirt twice. The first time I received the wrong item. The second time the shirt did not fit and the style wasn't really as advertised so I'm not sure if it was the right item or not or if the site just misrepresented it. Either way I sent both shirts back and will not shop this brand again.
"These were the best glasses, until they broke at the hinge and the company refused to replace them. They said I could buy a new pair at the ""discounted price"" of $109. They were less than 1 year old.

I will NEVER buy another pair of Ray Bans"
"These are a mixed bag. I tried these on in my size at a store, but they didn't have black so I ordered through Amazon. When they arrived they're much stiffer and narrower. The right foot is a hair narrower than the left, and my foot doesn't feel planted on the insole. I feel like my little toe isn't ok the insole at all.
I'm going to wear these around the house for a few days and see if I can break them in."
Wears out quickly.
"I really wanted to like this product because besides being a perfect color match, it really evened out my skin tone and gave me the most amazing glow -- at least when looking in my house/bathroom mirror.  I didn't see a single sparkle; just a lovely sheen that made my skin look like it was glowing from within.  I was mesmerized by how perfect it made my complexion look that I was certain I had found my ""can't live without' beauty product.

Fast forward to later that afternoon; while running errands I took a glance up in my car mirror and was shocked to see that apparently, a glitter bomb had exploded on my face.  I looked like a sparkly disco ball!  I gave this another try the following day using just a smidge; but it still was way too sparkly in sunlight.  Would only possibly wear this product in the evening and even then; I'm not sure it'd be worth it if there were any chance of flash photography or having to walk into a well lit restroom with my girlfriends.  I may get some use out of this as a highlighter for my cheekbones or legs; but at my age, this type of sparkle is a big no no for all over face use.  The itty bitty sparkles accentuate all the things I want to keep hidden in daylight!  Fine lines, pores, imperfections.  It only looks good under dim lighting conditions.

***Update***
I hate throwing out perfectly good products and just wanted to share that I did find a use for this as a highlighter.  After applying makeup, a quick swipe down the center of my nose gives the bridge of my nose the perfect contoured look without all the work of contouring; no need to blend!  I also use a dab on my cupid's bow to highlight my lips and as a highlighter on my cheekbones/brow bones.  When used this way, the shimmer doesn't overwhelm your face and sink into pores/fine lines.  I'll probably have this 'forever' at the rate I'm using it (just a smidge here and there) but it's pretty much become a staple in my daily beauty routine.  I wouldn't feel put together and polished without it :)."
"Loved the look of the shoe.  Could have worn with many things.  However, was disappointed that it only came in whole sizes and I'm an 8-1/2.....First ordered a 9 and it slipped off my foot.  Then ordered an 8 and it was way too tight......so had to send both back.  Ordered a woman's sketcher Bob's surfy ballet slipper which came in half sizes and love that it fits well and looks great."
"Cheaply made, way too large in the band, horrendous customer service."
I would give it 5 stars but I'm gonna give it 2 because I received 3 sets of doubles and that's not cool at all...
These don't fit as a woman's size. I have size 9 in my Metcon 2 and ordered the same size in the Metcon 3 and they fit too large. I could have gotten a size 8. which makes me wonder if this is really a Womans Metcon 3. I am absolutely disappointed.
"The glasses are much bigger than they look here. Also, the frame itself is too narrow at least for me."
"The shoe is nice, It however did not come in the colors I ordered but I was starting a new job the next day and I have to wear sneakers and I had none so I had to keep them."
Humongous on me!!! It's more like a 5x dress then a 2x shirt. It goes below my knees and I'm 5.2
"Expect high level shoes, left one fot excellent, very comfortable BUT right one since first use of 60km ride leaves me a horrible pain in my feet in the instep. Now I'm leaving the strap totally loose anyway is giving me impact on the instep and is killing my foot and causing my pedaling style changing trying to take care of this impact as it's really hurts.
I have no other shoes at the moment so no other option to ride with but it's really something bad with them.
I have own other shimano shoes and never got anything like this.
I expected high level shoes experience and got no wearable shoes.
Want to get a response from this as this is really a manufacturing defect or really bad shoes model."
"This was a pretty shirt.  I received lots of comments on it the one time I wore it.  Unfortunately, I washed it.  I followed the instructions BUT it shrunk a lot and I will never be able to wear it again."
"I buy Rekucci tops all the time -- I have 12 in different colors and wear them all the time.  This skirt is the weirdest fit, and not up to the quality I have come to expect from Rekucci (I had a similar problem with their capri pants, too).  Although it is stretchable material, it is tapered so much from hip to knee that you have to sort of hobble to walk in it."
Did not like this shoe at all.  Returned them immediately
The pocket square and tie are made for very cheap material.
A size large is way too small.
"The socks aren't really small, only that they are too tight because of spandex. I have peripheral neuropathy pain in my feet. At home,  I wear loose fitting socks and slippers. The original World's Softest Socks were perfect, but the socks aren't made that way any more."
The quality is not good I would not purchase this.
"This looked like a great bag, but in reality it's quite flimsy and has very few pockets. It's the first thing I've ever returned on Amazon. The ibagbar is a WAY better alternative."
Wrist band too large and battery dead. Have to replace battery and remove excess links. Ending up paying more for it.
Was great at first then the sewing along the zipper torn. Waste of money.
"I've owned this watch now for a year and would wear it a lot more if it didn't hurt. The metal frames that holds the straps tend to rub against my arm, and  it gets noticeably uncomfortable after an hour or so. If I loosened it to try and solve the problem it would start sliding and rotating around, which is pretty unfortunate. At least I can say it looks quite nice and is still ticking away."
it broke the first time i wore it. It is cheaply made... and the strap falls off right away.
The color was not like the picture.
this  item was sent back with the rest of the pants i order and they keep saying I owe for the pants
"Love these!

UPDATE:
When I first got these, I really liked them.  But only a few months later, & they have fallen apart."
"Poor quality!
Picture shows that is bad products."
The cut in this shoe is very small. This the second pair of  skecher I have brought  had to  return . order a size larger and that size was to big.
Could not zip up half way past my calves! I *think* I have normal calves! WAY TOO SMALL!
"They're good glasses for the price, sure, but they're not anything like the glasses in the photos. I ordered these in Leopard under the assumption that they were round lenses, as both the photos and item name suggested. They are not only more of a cat-eye shape, but also a gaudy leopard pattern, nothing like the smaller pattern pictured in the photos. They look like fine glasses, but they're not the ones pictured."
Hate the fabric!
"No support for the ball of your foot. It needs some cushioning because after awhile, it feels like you feel all of the imperfections on the ground below you. If it had better support, I would like it, but it doesn't. I depend 100% on the hosiery I wear to see if I can at least last through lunch."
They were tight to get on my feet. Had to work my feet into them just to attempt to have them fit.
"Very cheap quality, very small"
Sashineleba da sazizgroba.
"Had to return them. Way too long, even if you get your size the shoe seems to run big."
Not what I was expecting at all. Its SUPER thin and yes it can super quickly but not worth my money
"The size was too large for a 36 D. I wanted to return the item and the seller replied stating that return shipping is not free and has to be paid by the buyer.

The material was soft and good. Anyways I am returning this bra."
"I wear a size 6M (7.5 women) US. These socks are very snug on my feet. No room for movement. Elastic at top is tight on my leg. The fabric does not stretch. Socks are very thin. Perfect for the summer. Colors are vibrant and very cute same as shown. Not sure how durable they are going to be. Expecting them to rip after first wear. I also ordered two packs from this company at the same time. Weird thing is, they delivered one pack without a signature, but required a signature for the other pack. Now I have to drive just to pick up my package. Kind of a bummer."
Not really what it looks like in the picture. I didn't realize the top of the shirt and sleeves were black lace. Doesn't really go with the shirt and the lace fell apart after the first wash.
"Ill fitting shoe; returned to Amazon. Even the wide style wasn't wide enough. Sort of a ""made in China"" feel to them. Not worth the $$."
"I went by the size chart and ordered an 8 (my correct size).  The length is okay, however, the ""roomy fit"" is more than roomy, it's HUGE.  The strap does nothing to help this so I'm going to have to either return them or see if they can be exchanged for something else.  I'm disappointed because the design and pattern are really cute."
"I ordered up a size (I usually wear a 14, so I ordered a 16) to be a little more comfortable at work. I accidently ordered the work pants. I usually get the slacks. They are a much stronger material, but there is NO STRETCH. These run smaller than other Dickies I have purchased and there is no forgiveness."
"These shoes should be broken in after about 3 months but they are like walking on boards.  I have been buying nothing but 990's and their upgrades for decades and what kept me coming back was their immediate comfort, stability and durability.  And they were comfortable right out of the box. Even though they are still supposedly made in the US I have some doubt.  The last few pairs have been tight and the current pair as mentioned above are very hard.  Also makes me wonder if these shoes are not knockoffs rather than the real deal.  Amazon should look into this possibility--especially since we can order direct from New Balance if we choose."
"These are just enormous!  I got them for my son (who was 5 at the time he wore them), and they were huge on him. But even on an adult they wouldn't have looked right. Both my husband and I tried them on, and they looked too big, and were even so huge that they wouldn't stay on our ears, but kept falling off. There was no way my 5-year-old would have been able to keep them on. We had to get rid of them, and couldn't use them at all :("
"These glasses look pretty cute on, but they feel really flimsy and cheap (like you'd buy at the drug store).  I love Kate Spade products, but I'd skip these."
What I received looked nothing like this.  It looks like it will fit my 2 year old daughter.  Poorly made.
"The propet cliff walker strap boots were too narrow and small for my feet. Despite me being able to wear a 4E 11.5 in other shoes comfortably, in this case the shoes were too small. Not a good shoe at all, straps too thin, would not buy another one from this company. And refunds are not allowed either so I lost my money as well. Caveat emptor."
"unfortunate this fit was totally off, way too small..not very much stretch"
Shine gone too fast
"These came in the teal color I needed and the length I needed since I'm tall. However, they are extremely wide in the leg and crotch area. They make me feel like a parachute. I wouldn't advise going down a size because the elastic seems sized correctly. I'm going to tailor these myself and just take them in along the inseam. I'm 5'9"", 150lbs, and usually wear a small for reference."
Very hard bottom. Almost feels like styrofoam.  It was uncomfortable and felt cheap so I returned them.
Don't waste your money. Wore these 2 days. Didn't do anything strenuous just walking. Ended up with horrible foot pain. Never again.
Way TOO small!! Based on normal sized style pants that I order....should have ordered another 2 sizes UP.
"Cute little backpack, got it for my 2 y.o., so she can carry on her back (just like her big sister, who carries hers to school). poor quality! not safe for toddlers. The yellow plastic button/nose immediately came off. :(
I would not recommend buying this for a toddler if they like putting small objects in their mouth."
"These sandals are WAY too narrow.  My little toe is hanging over the edge on each sandal, and I don't have wide feet.  Gotta send these back.  Wish Reef would cut them a little more generously."
Would make a nice nightgown.  Much too flimsy to wear as a dress.  I returned it.
Way too large for medium size
The shorts fit fine but the top didn't fit well around my breast. It was too loose. Maybe I am just not large enough in that area.
way too small I'm 5'6 and 135/140 they go half way up my shins to fit on my waist and if in the right spot for length the crotch is at my knees and waist is barely to my tushNeed to be short to fit them the product would be wonderful if it fit
"The length is fine, but made for wide heels.  I wear a 7, and the 7 length ok, but i walked right out of them. Need a slipper that has a narrower heel.  had to return."
Shirt was completely balled up inside of bag from shipping. Bag wasn't even closed. Looked like a return. Fit as expected but wrinkled and doesnt look new
Bit small and take long too deliverm
Runs Very small.
"These pants are put together very poorly.  There were threads hanging all over the place, and the seams were not straight.  To make it even more interesting, they have an awkward shape. My first thought was that I had the wrong size, but until I tried to move, they seemed fine.  They didn't pull or seem too small all over, but at weird places, like the calf and the middle of my thigh, but not the waist or hips. My second thought was that I was too hippy and they were not laying right/pulling at odd places, so I handed them to my husband who has NO hips.  They fit him awkwardly, too.  Good thing I kept the package, since they are going back today."
"Unfortunately, when we go on the less costly side, we will always pay in the wheels. Falls over on side in a rush through airport because the wheels are cheep."
Have similar shorts in size 44 and they fit perfect.  Not these. I ordered another pair in size 46 and they fit  perfect.
These pants had a lot of potential and that potential will hopefully be realized on someone else.  They didn't fit me at all so back they went.  As a result I can't attest to anything about them.
"Sure can not stick in dryer, shrinks.  Than they are a lot darker then shown,.,"
Much smaller than the advertised dimensions.
"The dress is used and pilled up as well as smells like someone has worn it quite a bit.  I have never had to send something back, but this is going back before I try it on.  The material is a little thinner than I would like, and the dress runs short.  I am 5'7""and it fits about four inches above my feet."
Gem fell out in less than a week
This fit larger than I was expecting it too and it was also very thin and see through.
"I was hoping for an inexpensive clog to replace the ones I've had forever, but it was not comfortable and was falling off my feet, with every step."
This dress is made of very cheap material and the hem is not even sewn.  DON'T waste your money!!!
Very poor quality.  Has memory and bends out after 1 week of use
"It's nice, well fitted, but there was a problem that the hat was really not lined up, really out of shape! Clean, but just that problem."
"Cheap, cheap, cheap. Get what you pay for on this one plus its super itchy material and there is no way I'd ever last wearing it."
Looks boho sheek but when you put it on the Pom Pom sticks up to a point like an elf if you have a small head this may fit different
I found them to be 'too shorten length. I donated them. I was very disappointed in them.
"Very cute and made to description, but cheap quality and poorly made. Broke after 1 day of wear, which made my daughter very sad for her bday"
The material is cheap and it makes the shirt uncomfortable
"My shirt came in and the color,print and cut of it is completely different from the shirt advertised. Instead of one tiger face i have two. Front and back. My tigers color are faded and the cut is not loose. There is spandex on the sides to make it fitted. I would still wear it to maybe a park or put for a jog but the outfit i envisioned is now gone. IDK about anyone else maybe mine was a mix up but it will take too long to send back so i'm just stuck with my two headed tiger shirt."
"These are cute Nine West flats.  I have the taupe patent.  However for me the fit was awkward.  They are very pointy which makes them somewhat long to get to the correct size.  (I like the look) but the back of the shoe hurts my foot.  With every step it does not give at all and the hard material of the heel really hurts my foot. I can only wear them for short periods, where mostly sitting.  As  soon as I have to walk, unpleasant."
This is a good looking watch the band however is not it has shown signs of wear within the first few days and needs to be replaced.
"This suit is ADORABLE!  However, it runs VERY VERY VERY VERY small.  I would normally wear a 2XL but, because of the other reviews, I went with the 3XL.  This didn't even fit as a plus size...on any part of my body.  Their idea of a 3XL is my idea of a 14 or 16 MAYBE.  As far as I can tell, 3XL is as large as they come.  In addition, I need to respond to all the people who complained about the center jewel thing coming off the first time they wore it and so one....  It's designed to come off!  It isn't supposed to stay on there permanently.  I am assuming this is for the purpose of machine washing it."
"I should have took the other reviewers advise and passed up on these shoes. My foot wouldn't even fit into the shoe. I normally wear a nine wide but it seemed as if I was trying to fit into a 7. I'm so upset and sad. They're very pretty but just way too small. Hoping for an easy return.

2/1/16
The return was a pain in the butt. I went to the post office to send the shoes off only to discover that this would cost the same amount as the 2 pairs that I brought. I emailed the company and they sent me a shipping label. I'm glad that this is not too much of a hassle."
"Maybe, I am just used to New balance's fit. I ordered this in a 2 E and it felt like a vice grip in the forepart of my foot. Tried wearing them several times hoping they would break in. No luck. Ended up giving them to a friend with a narrow foot."
"fit is not as described, the length is not as pictured and i was unhappy with the handling of my return, they are in china and it made it difficult to communicate as well as return, you have to pay for it to go back but it is international, with the price of the item it is not worth the hassle, and i am stuck with it"
I've tried several pair & they always seem to hurt at the little toe are where the seems come together. The length seems ok but width not so good.
omg - I got broken HAT.
"I wish i cud give it -1 ita that small. And yes my sons head is not big. Hes an asian guy with a normal head circumference. And yet a 7 to 8 size wudnt fit my 5yrs old son.
My 3 yrs old daughter wears a 7 to 8yrs old hat."
"Would like it to be smaller and a lot darker, seemed faded"
It is very big and it does not look like an off shoulder blouse. The hole for the neck is too small.
"Does not fit too well, even though I am athleticly fit. It is too small, for a size large.."
Gave away cute but to small
"Does not fit right, have tried everything, even bent the cuff to the shape of my ear and it still will not stay in place! I have others cuff picked out as possible purchases but not sure after I have been unable to use this one."
"Dress goes down past my knee caps mid thigh. Also, said it ran small in the ad and it actually fit bigger than expected."
The engraving doesn't even look as good as the ones done at the mall kiosks. The stones are very pale/flat looking.
I returned this shapewear and Amazon said they never received it.  Way over priced and way too tight and thick under clothes.  Bad deal all around for me.
"A few months ago I purchased on Amazon, a very good 2"" wide sturdy woven military belt with a heavy duty buckle.  I thought this might be it so ordered again to see, and it was NOT.  Narrower, thinner belt with shiny buckle made of metal so thin it will no longer hold the belt firmly after a couple months use.  It is an ok belt, but certainly NOT HEAVY DUTY AS DESCRIBED."
"I've bought a lot of these outfits and been fine. I rarely leave bad reviews.  This pretty much fell apart and some parts were broken on arrival.

I could go on and on and my poor son is saying ""broke"" over and over because the badge just fell off.

It comes with two fire extinguishers. The first has a screw cap but doesn't squirt.  The second has a broken top and dribbles but doesn't squirt.

The badge fell off the jacket before he even wore it.

The bullhorn doesn't actually function as a bullhorn.  After putting batteries in, it makes a siren sound that doesn't sound like anything in America and is very quiet and a short sound.

The quality is ridiculously cheap even for $25 set.  It's not even worth the trouble to return this.

But it bothers me how excited my son gets only to be let down on his birthday.

Don't buy this set.

- Peter"
This bra would have been awesome if it wasn't for the fact that one cup is much smaller than the other. The size difference is quite obvious so I don't know how the seller could have missed it
The seersucker is very scratchy.  I have several seersucker shirts and they are fine.  This doesn't feel good on my skin.
"I ordered 5 of these. Three of them were completely SMASHED in the package. The other two were just dented so they won't snap shut. But in all, they are useless and went straight into the garbage. They aren't worth sending back because they were so cheap to begin with."
Not very happy with this boot. Fits 1/2 size small and was cheaply made so I retuned this
Well made but didn't like the cut.
"Its ni thing lije the pic.. horrible. The alweve are to tigh. The hear shepe it doea even stay low. Is all the way to my back. The front sidw is nothinglike the pic. It came a bit rip under my arm pit. This probanly fits to some one who is super skinny , small boob. And a biggggggg but... to small. Very disapointed...nothing like the puc. U can't even tell where the hell is tge hear in the but.."
"These are cute, but they are not functional. I am small chested, usually wearing a 34 B. I wore one to work the first time, and it just kept sliding down all the time. Several times if I waited too long to pull it up, it would be completely off my chest! How embarrassing. I would not recommend these :( I really wanted them to work!"
"I've ordered two of these, based on the great reviews and regret it. I've ordered a 36D, which is my bra size and works for other sports bras, but this one is way too small. There is no way this is made for a d cup, let alone a 36D. I had to really squeeze my way into this bra and it felt tight and highly uncomfortable, flattening my chest.

I have also ordered two ""Moving Comfort Women's Fiona Bra"" and can highly recommend those. They fit perfectly and have become my favorite bras."
"The card holder is lovely. The magnet money clip, useless. Not sure if mines was defective or what but the magnet was extremely weak and wouldn't securely hold any bills."
"Not sized correctly, I purchased these after already owning the same boot and for some odd reason this new pair fit smaller"
"Very cheap material, too long and straps didn't last through a wash"
was flat and nothing like the picture and it fell apart.
"Very attractive looking, nice for price, my issue with it was that it would fall over, was continuously picking up from floor, had to lean against walls or myself to keep from falling."
I was looking for a sweater dress... this is not it lol.
I ordered an XL and it was way too tight.  I gave it to my size 8 sister.
Looks like a cardboard cartoon drawn shirt
Difficult to adjust. Will give to charity.
"My shoe size is 12.5, but the 13 of this sandal had straps that were very tight.  Now, normally I might have tried to break the shoe in & see if they loosened up.  However, the feather foam cushioning was IMO inferior to both the Phantom/Slap/Fanning & Flex style cushioning.  It was certainly soft...just too thin for my liking.  Love Reef sandals, just not these.  They got returned.  YMMV."
"Man when you takes these out of the shipping the feel like butter on bread but with one wash they shrink way more than expected, I had to give them to my wife and trust me there is a huge size difference between us, Im 220 she is 130"
"It didn't work for me.  Looked like a good one, but didn't fit me right."
The terry cloth is not thick and plush.  Very thin material.
"This swimsuit does not fit well at all.  The material is cheap and the placement of the mesh is not flattering either.  Not to mention the padding in the bra! that didn't work for me since I am already a double D

I really wanted this to be an awesome swimsuit but it failed miserably."
"Nice looking shoe, but it completely ate up the back of my heel.  I thought I may just have to wear them in, but no.  I tried for months and every time I would walk in them I would end up limping.  Working out in them was out of the question.  I'm not sure if it was my feet or the shoe, but I've never had this issue before."
Can't put much in it.  Worthless to me
Looks nothing like the picture at all.
I regreted to buy this shoes. It's W width but rather narrow in fact. And the size must be wrong .
"They hurt my kids feet. I like the price and look. They are soft and warm because of the fur lining. However, suddenly my son liked to be picked up or ride in stroller even though he usually does not. Then we somehow we asked him where he his feet hurt and he said yes. Maybe the bottom is not flexible enough? I don't know. Since my son had used them for couples of weeks, I did not return them. But I wish I could."
The fit is ok but if you are trying to where it tight to slim it is not that comfortable.  It is very itchy and the elastic has already begun to pull apart and I have not worn it that many times nor that tight.
"The socks are too tight in the ankles and the quality of the material is just.... cheap.  They are nothing like Gold Toe socks that I buy from Macys.  I don't know what vendor these socks come from but they are horrid.

Don't buy them."
You get what you pay for. Two of them came with holes in the crotch area. Two starts because my daughter loved the color and wore them about twice. Don't expect them to last more than a few wears. They shrink if you wash in the machine.
Very very difficult to clasp. Looks ok. Hopefully will have to have help fastening it.
"I ordered these shoes per all the reviews expecting a wonderful pair of shoes.  I have wide feet so I ordered my size in Wide.  When they arrived, I put them on and couldn't believe they were tight around my widest foot area.  When I looked at the box to check the size, I saw that they had slapped an 8 1/2 W sticker over the manufactured print of 8 1/2 B.  Looked at the insides of the shoes and, sure enough, it read 8 1/2 B as well.  I have no idea why they did that but, needless to say, I needed to return them.  Was quite frustrated to have to go to the trouble of returning them (I hate returning things!).  However, having said that, the company did refund me completely (hence the extra star).  Can't tell you whether they help with plantar fasciitis or not since I was not able to wear them. ):"
Very disappointed in the fabric and fit.  Probably better after the dress is iron.
"My daughter loves these jeans, but they were too small. Must size up. I ordered another pair of jeans (same namebrand & same size, different style) & they fit. Go figure..."
"This was my second time purchasing this corset. The moment I tried it on the zipper came off the track. Will not ever buy again. Color is beautiful, but made poorly."
Will return or donate to charity.
Yeah Not Even Close!  The item ran so small it looks like something from the children's department!
Arrived on time but the stone was not cut properly and the metal are crooked. I'm so disappointed.
"I will preface this review by saying the function and design are great.  I wore these once and was very happy with them. They worked great and the clasps were secure holding the fabric for the 12 hours I wore them.  So why the 2 stars?  Well, on the second morning I went to put them on, one clasp simply fell off. Looking at the seam on fabric that is folded over holding the clasp to the fabric trying to figure out why this would happen
revealed that the thread sewn into the seam holding on the clasp appeared to only pierce the seam about 3-4 times and was certainly defective in the manufacture of the item. This lead me to look at the other stays and, to no surprise, I found that the seams holding the clasp on all of them were all very poorly sewn was every one was in some stage of coming apart...so the seams retaining the clasp on all of these stays will likely have failed by the second wearing.  On a side note, I did not have these fastened down taught; they were actually slightly loose for comfort.  At 5'9"" and 145 lbs they just didn't have the strain on them to justify this kind of failure rate which is the reason for the poor rating,  Again, the design and function, when they were still in one piece was great and perhaps I will revise my review depending on the resolution."
"I like this bag and use it still, but a seam came unthreaded after 2 weeks leaving a 8 inch hole in bag. I contacted seller and they have yet to resolve issue."
"The neckline was enormous, and the material (as others have said) was odd.  Not for me!"
My husband could not wear this! I had to and Im 56. More like women costume
"Fit a bit small around the arm pits, also... the print of the dress doesnt look right...
Lower quality than other dresses I've purchase on amazon for a similar price.."
These lab coats are absolutely terrible. They are very heavy weight and are not wrinkle free. I would have returned them had I not waited so long to wear one and missed the opportunity.
"Because of its small size, if each card slot is filled and bills added, it would end up being 1"" thick.  If it were larger (and still fit the back pocket as my present wallet) the cards would spread out to reduce thickness.  Bad design."
"Get what you pay for.  Super cheap feel and look, but visibility is actually pretty decent.  Would not expect more than a couple of months or less of regular wear.  Would not buy again for myself or child."
"The fit of these shoes are not true to size. I have medium feet and the width is too narrow. The toes rub against the top of the shoe inside and squeeze around the widest part of your foot. I can't see wearing these shoes without getting corns, blisters and bunions. I sit at a desk and my feet were very uncomfortable, even with weight taken off. The shoes look really nice and they're trendy. I like Naturalizer and debated about wearing them more to break them in. I'm not happy with these shoes and I'm of the mind to return them."
I bought these for high winter socks. Yes they are decently high but the patterns are not as nice as the picture and they are not warm. I returned them and bought mens winter socks
The shoes are beautiful and i wish the material was a lil more resistent...unfortunately they didn't last anything :( one strip riped and couldn't even use them...good design but bad materials
This shoe runs very small. We ordered one size bigger than our daughters feet and still was too small. I am returning. On the plus side the return process was hassle free.
too small for the size i ordered
"I returned a size 8, which is my granddaughters normal size, for a 9 and that was still too short."
It did hold up very long
"FitFlops are my go to footwear for in the house and weekend footwear.  I always order one size down and add a FootPetal sole for additional comfort and no sliding.

The wide sole provides great cushioning and comfortable all-day wear.

These slippers look cheap.  It is a brassy gold and the ""jeweled"" accents look cheap."
"It isn't a true metal.
My ring turned my finger green afyer just 3 days of wearking it.
My boyfriend was planning on using it as my faux engagement ring until we get the money for a real ring, but since this ring is now unwearable it appears we will have to shop elsewhere."
The sole of the shoe is totally inflexible making normal walking almost impossible.
This has no support without the underwire.
"Ordered these pants for work. However, they are too big even though they are petite. The fabric is also kind of stiff (not sure if it will soften after washing). I will most likely be returning these."
Looks cheap and some of the crystals have fallen out!!  Sending it back
"Even though I got a larger size, my toes were at the top of the shoe. Not as comfortable as the Asiccs hiking and running shoe!"
One size does not fit all!!!
Shrinks with every wash in both directions. Now I have pair of really tight capri jeans.
"I ordered Soft Style Women's Cloie Mary Jane Pump, Black, 8.5WUS from Shoe & Co.  Big mistake I should have made sure it was through Amazon.  Why?  The shoe was too long and no way comfortable.  I requested a return authorization and return label.  They authorized a return but only an offer of using their UPS plan for $8.00 for a return label.  I think the shoe style is very cute, just wish they had fit properly.  Had I ordered through Amazon there would been no problem with a return and return label."
Was under the impression that the boot was REAL LEATHER ....as advertised ....but they are not
"Had to return these, too 'thin'...not comfy to grip..."
These socks ended up in the trash. They were too tight on my calves and they were see through. You could see red fibers under the white stripe. It was cheaply made. Pretty disappointed.
"too small . no room for man parts. i threw them out. in a word ,""ouch."""
Looks old fashion; not stylish; colors faded
"The fit was large, stepping into the shoe it felt big on the instep part.  The shoe actually comes off.  I've never had this problem before."
"Very cheap fabric, and totally different from the pictures, very disappointed!!"
Looks like the crotch is hanging way too low which gives a skirt look but uncomfortable baggy pant feel.  Very annoying when wet
"It is way too small. That's a doll's dress size not for a baby. It cheaply made, almost felt too hard to wear and be comfy in."
Pam....you been to go back to the drawing board on the Tummy liners and Bra Liners.  Tummy liners are too wide and the Bra liners are not wide enough!  Bad material choice.  rubs skin and makes rash worse.....
"Don't waste ur money it's made really small n it fits like a quarter sleeve not long sleeve like the pic shows, I won't b ordering anything from them anymore"
"These were really cute, but I wore them only once before they came unglued. The backing is really loose and when I took them off, it came apart and there was no way to fix it"
"Would be ADORABLE if the swimsuit had any stretch to the fabric at all. It literally didn't stretch even a tiny bit. Very firm form and seams, very unlike any swimsuit I've ever tried before. It fit width wise but length wise was very short, would never cover my breasts standing normally, and I'm not large breasted at all. Bummer it isn't made well bc it's really cute!"
This belt was fairly expensive and no buckle. I took a chance. What a terrible mistake! The belt took a long time to get here and it was falling apart when it arrived. Just stuffed in a box with three pieces of bubbles. The inside material (definitely NOT leather) was peeling off and you could see the layers underneath that also getting ready to peel. Looked like a leftover piece of scrap. I do not recommend!
The wig was cheap and did not hold up it's shape.  Out of the packaging the wig started to curl up and become frizzy! The only accurate aspect of the wig was the color was the perfect electric blue.  Do not buy! Save your money.
the slippers started coming unthreaded on the back and they didn't even last a day who ever made these knows nothing about making ballet slippers or house shoes poor quality made slippers the stitching not very strong at all please folks don't buy these slippers thier not worth it
It would fit a child!!!
"I am extremely disappointed that within the first few weeks of wear, the fabric and rubber began to fray and peel back. This was prior to even the start of sports which these definitely would not have survived. Shame on you UA for wasting a Mom's time and money."
"I do not like this item.  It is too tight (maybe I should have ordered a larger size), but I  ordered a size larger than I normally would wear.  It does nothing for my abdomen except make me look like a pregnant women.  It is very difficult to get on and even harder to get off.  I should have returned it, but I discarded the sales sliip and other information that came with it.  I would like to have tried a larger size."
SIZE IS OBLIVIOUS TO REALITY SIZE
Did not fit well. Too bulky in arms and body but did fit across shoulders. Fabric too heavy for the high humidity in our area. Returned.
"I loved this shoe when I first put it on, but by the end of the day my feet hurt awful.  I have not tried it again, but I plan to.  Hopefully, it just has to stretch out some."
Would barely fit on a Ken doll....
"This fits well, but its impossible to get off when wet"
Cute but they run narrow. They're so narrow that they should really be listed as narrow. My feet generally are thin for most shoes and these boots were too tight. I suggest trying ordering at least 2 sizes up.
"I think I got the sample shoe. One was dis-colored and wider than the other (like it had been tried on a million times). There were small rock already imbedded in the shoe sole. The suede appeared to be worn on one shoe. I was so excited to have these because I had seen them at Macy's about a month earlier for twice the cost... should have purchased them then. I had tried them on in the store so I knew what size to get and everything, they were super cute. Buying shoes online can be hit or miss, this was a sad miss.
***Update: Do not buy from ShoeMetro. I was told my return package was received and it would take ""up to 7 business days"" for a refund. It has been beyond the 7 days quoted and I still do not have my money back. Seller is not being truthful.
***DO NOT BUY FROM SHOEMETRO**** Have been in contact with seller for WEEKS now. ShoeMetro now claims to have not received my package(eventhough I have an email from them saying otherwise). They have my item and won't provide a refund. I have sent screen shots of the UPS tracking page and provided the tracking number and still have not received my funds back."
"This scarf is bulky and feels funny to the touch. Not nice to wrap around your face. The colors, however, are a nice combination."
There is no way this skirt was made for adults. Not a chance.
It fell and the glass broke immediately. SO DISAPOINTED.
"I am 5'4'' 130 lbs 34C and I order a size medium.  The biggest problem with this suit was the gaping on both sides of the cups.  It only fit perfect if I crisscrossed the straps at my chest and then tie in behind my neck.  Otherwise there was just too much fabric on the outer parts of the bikini top.  I may have just received a defective swimsuit.  I would have ordered another one, but I'm going on vacation and it wouldn't arrive on time."
"had to return it, I brought it for a train for my up coming wedding but it was not dressy enough not saying its a bad product just not what I needed."
"While the description stated ""leather"", I was really disappointed to find that none of this shoe is leather except for the dark pink ""spice"" panel.  All other parts are a faux leather that looks cheap.  Since the soles are also the faux leather fabric, they get dirty too fast and will not last walking on hard surfaces like the regular Robeez with the thicker suede bottoms.  Since you are basically buying fabric booties, they should not be priced like shoes!"
smaller than described. you can not make a headscarf out of these which is why I bought them in the first place.
Nice shirt but I am not a fan of how it fit me but the shirt looks really nice.
"They fit as expected but haven't worn well. With in 3 months I was needing new shoes again. Asics usually are great products, this one was a miss for me."
"These shoes were perfect in every way except that I could not get my feet in them at all. I wear a size 37 in Danskos and a 6.5-7 overall and the Sanita size 37 was so small I question whether even a size 38 would fit. Maybe try some on first! Otherwise lovely shoes and certainly comparable to Danskos in quality and style for a much better price.

Update: tried buying a size up (38) and they literally fall off my feet. I am very disappointed with this product. Should have stuck with Danskos for the extra $20... Or went to a store like people *used* to do."
Didn't like color of shoes and I ordered 8 median I received a 8 narrow I returned the shoes
THIS DRESS RUNS BIG
fabric was good but it is a cheap looking shirt
"I ordered this product in a size 34B - the size that both my wife and daughter wear.  Although both of them said that the fit was fine in terms of sizing, they both complained that the bra seem to be digging in on the sides of their rib cages below their armpits. This made the bra very uncomfortable to wear, and they said they would not really recommend this product to other people. The bra was fine and every other regard."
Very uncomfortable. Poorly constructed. The back hurt. I'm returning it.
The first time my grandchild wore this she looked adorable. One washing and the pink flower lost all color.
poor merchandise
"CHEAP ,NICE FOR SMALL AND YOUNGER CHILDREN , NOT GOOD QUALITY"
"I liked the look of these pants, but the fit as weird - the waist and hips fit perfectly, but the thighs were weirdly tight."
"The tongue of the shoe is too short in width. When you put the shoe on, the sides of the tongue are visible. Other than that, which is enough to bypass this particular NB shoe, it's a beautiful shoe and fits very well."
"Are you for real?  This tee is not made out of cotton blend, it's 100% plastic.  The color is not as pictured. Also, the sizing is way off. Size Medium is advertized as 32.2"" bust, our tee came with 28"" bust. Requesting a refund."
"I used to trust this brand, I don't anymore. The top of the boot was too small to zip and the foot was at least a full size too large. The heals had visible ware within less than a month."
"Ugh I am so disappointed and usually I love ROXY flip flops.  These are incredibly squeaky!  With every step the most annoying squeak happens I have tried different walking, gripping toes, nothing work it is just the material on the flip flop and my heel.  SO ANNOYING!  But now I am ready day one wearing them and didn't notice the squeak at home on the carpet:(  I guess I have to keep them!"
This is way too small on me. It won't even wrap around me. Next time I'll be sure and order a larger size than my current size.
"Cheap, little tie. You pay for what you get. I'd recommend spending a couple more dollars for something actually wearable."
"The way this tie was packaged resulted in several creases, wrinkles, and divets.  Loose thread on one end.  Was not double boxed as per the advertisement.  Was very short, not the 54 inches as advertised.  Not worth the price."
"When I first took them out of the box I was very disappointed.  They feel like they are made of plastic.  The finish is rough and the etching is so light it is almost impossible to see.  Truly not worth $55.  If they are really made of stainless steel, good, but I have my doubts."
"What they show on the model is NOT the product that will arrive at your door. These should be listed and sold as women's panties. Pouch has no room for your package, too low on the waist, too high on the thigh and cheeks and definitely see through. If this is your game, you'll like them but chosen to be an option under sport shorts and workout wear they are not. Looked best when I kicked them to the floor. Bad purchase for poor quality product."
"I wear a size 12 pants, and these did not fit well at all.  The front came up very high, while the back barely covered my back side.  I have found this to be true of other leggings I have tried.  I ended up returning them.  Instead I went to Wal-Mart, paid less and have been very pleased with a fleece lined pair of black leggings!"
"The face mask I received was NOT the one pictured here.  The mouth hole was connected to the eye holes with NO space in between as pictured.  so basically there were two eye holes and a nose hole, which doesn't make any sense."
I return it to small I should get it bigger size
Sizes run way to small. Ripped as soon as I put them on.
"Very cute, but smelled horrible. Awful chemical smell that will not go away. Such a shame as the scarf itself is adorable. Have washed several times- smell is still there. It might not be so bad if the item wasn't worn right next to your face. Unwearable item at this point......"
"Great quality and design but very, very small, contrary to a couple of other reviews on this site.  The hat I received could only fit a child.  I am an adult woman with a very small hat size and this hat does not even begin to sit on my head properly.  I would send it back if the seller was not in the UK.  I would NOT recommend this for adult women with a normal hat size.  Unfortunate because the hat is otherwise just fine.  I am very disappointed."
Very cheap. Looks like something you get from a flea market. Definitely not as nice as online.
"these were for my job and all the walking I do, however, what should have been my true size, these were HUGE.  I still haven't figured out what to do with them now but i guess I wish I had returned them.  Probably not wide would have worked.  I usually wear a 10 wide and these were even bigger than that size and width...bummer."
"I like the sound of a cologne that smelled like sweet tobacco and spirits, but my immediate impression was of strong musky vanilla smell.  Not terribly manly, TBH, and incredibly strong.

Also I'm not terribly impressed with the tacky sticker label, and cheap bottle.  The sprayer is not sealed, it was quite loose on the glass, so when the bottle arrived, part the box was soaked.  Looking at the sprayer, it was secured permanently and was tilted and slightly loose.  I was not able to get it off, but I could turn and wiggle it a bit.  Terribly cheap stuff, but on the other hand if you like it, it will go a long way.  This is a massive size for a man's perfume bottle, and it takes VERY little.  A single spray would be about 10x too much, IMO, so you might want to spray it onto a tissue, and then dab sparingly on your collar.  Do not put it on your skin, as the smell is impossible to wash off. It absorbs into your skin. It's been an entire day after I washed my hands a dozen times and I can still smell it."
"the fit is awful, if you size down its too tight on the hip, if you size up its huge. for reference i am usually a small, 5'7, 130 pounds"
HORRIBLE! SMALL AND SHEDS. NOT WORTH THE LITTLE I SPENT ON IT
"It was cheap and appeared poorly made.
Came on time but that was about the only good thing. It took effort to get it on and once on it was not oversized in the slightest."
Very dissapointed! It arrived broken. 1 star just because it is very pretty.
Eyelets broke after 3 months of normal use. Hate to throw out shoes since they don't look worn. Not happy.
These shoes have no support...your feet will start to hurt....gave them away....
"Will be returning these,
LOVE everything except the fit and I ordered half a size larger than the New Balance shoes I am wearing right now."
"A few reviewers mentioned that these socks were  tight.  Well, since I have skinny legs and a narrow foot (12.5 B) I figured that there was no way those comments would apply to me.  Wrong!  I had to wrestle the socks onto my feet and then risk tearing the material as I tugged them up my legs.(Good thing the material is high quality - - it didn't tear.)  So I wore the socks (indoors on carpet) for the better part of an afternoon, and when I took (wrestled) them off, I wore deep impressions from the elastic at the top band.  I'm about to contact Amazon to arrange for a return."
"I've had them for 4 months now. Very disappointed with them. This is very cheap leather. They scuff SO EASILY. I am not hard on shoes. I work in an office. And these boots have dents all over them. When they scuff, it reveals a white mark underneath. They did not get better with age as I expect a real leather product to."
"I fell in love with dress as soon as I put it on. It fit just as expected and I wore it with a black slip for a wedding reception. I got to the reception and actually had a few people compliment my new dress which I was excited about, worth the purchase right? Unfortunately less than 3 hours into the reception the dress started falling apart. As you can see from the photo there is a large tear and I can already see the straps falling apart. :("
Fits large and the padding makes this bra too warm to wear in summer.
It's really small and the coins fall out
They looked so cheap and miserable after washing them!!
"i LOVED this belt until not one But 2 of them broke off at the buckle...  At first I thought was a fluke, so I received my refund then purchased a second.  The same thing happened at the same place in the same time frame!!!

Belt looks great, but don't wear it, cuz it will BREAK!!!
GRRRRRRRRR"
"Returned it immediately. Really stiff, opening at the top was difficult. Color was exactly what was shown on my screen and I did like that aspect of it."
"I had to return a number of my DC shoes. I used to just order any old pair and they fit, and were comfortable. Now they are narrow and short."
I normally buy Large but these are really tight.
These run small!!! The xl is like a medium! My chest was squashed!! I do not recommend unless you have a small chest and frame!!!
"Bought by accident and guess what...""no returns."""
"The colors in no way match the pictures, and the length is very short.  I ordered the color Water Blue (which on the website looks so light blue that it is almost white), but what i received was a minty-teal color.  The skirt is shown to be long, but at 5'6 it hits me halfway between my knees and my ankles.  I'm returning it."
"Nice soft material but sucks as under wear. If you just want boxer shorts just get the cheap ones from Haynes or whoever. These are not like the photo shows them hugging your thighs, They are real loose and end up in your crouch and wedgie within minutes. I have a 30"" waist and got small, the waist fits fine. I was hoping they were more like 2UNDR, which are great and stay put. From now on just 2UNDR day shift for me."
Medium is like xl. Just way to wide.
"Buy these means and to reach all very nice except that they are too wide after the first wash became more wide

After 3 washes stockings fall , lost elasticity, they do not work fall , very wide"
Dial is so huge compare to the exchange/diff. model I got!
Wanted to like but they do not fit as well as UGG boots I have. Sizing is off.
They do not have much stretch to them
They look too cheap to wear.
"I love the look of this, but the reality is that it is made for women with a size B cup or less. I had to return it."
"Since wearing the shores, I have lost 5 of the beads on the left shoe and 3 on the right."
"Flimsy.  Not as long as shown (and I am only 5'4""!).  Washed in cold water and it shrunk by about 30% - making it even smaller and shorter.  NOT happy at all.  I rarely complain but I ordered this thinking I'd love it.  Will not order Lucky Brand items again.  :("
Didn't like it at all and have returned it.
"Wanted to give a better rating, but you can't show a picture of shoe that's brown when in reality it's green"
"The only reason these shoes get one star instead of zero, is because they're super cute.  My feet are not wide at all but these shoes made my feet feel like a giant's.  My poor feet would barely squeeze in there.  Never will I order a shoe like this again."
this things looked ridiculous - RUN!
Didn't fit. I had to go to the store and buy another one before my party.
"The fur was slightly pressed down and the inside lining was not staying in place when I pulled my arm out of the sleeves. It was a light duty coat when I was expecting a heavy duty coat. Other than the previous issues, it was a cute product but it was lacking in expectation."
These are so thin I can see through them!
LENTH DESCRIPTION (GENEROUS LENGTH) SHOULD BE MORE PRECISE IN ORDER TO BE USABLE.  HEIGHT OF BUYER WOULD BE BETTER DETERMINATION FOR ACCURATE FIT.  I GAVE THE ITEMS TO A  6 FOOT 6 INCH FRIEND
Looks worse in person than in photo. Very cheaply made.  Fortunately it was cheap so will use it for the trip I needed one for then toss it.
"I sent this bag back I doubted if it were leather and if so it wasn't good leather. I need a dependable, sturdy bag as I don't change very often."
"I had no idea this pendant was so large. It's pretty but it screams ""I'm fake"" and the chain that came with it is very thin and tangles."
To tight to late to semd back stuck with it.buy a larger size
I had to return them because they seemed loose on my foot.
The waist sits high. It's not flattering. I'm a somewhat athletic 5'7 140 pound woman with an hourglass figure and this just hides my waist. It's also the hottest material I have ever worn. The material is soft but wow it's like wearing a plastic trash bag. Makes you sweat and traps heat and moisture under the shirt. I doubt I will even wear this tank too in winter. Unfortunate purchase. I purchased the medium and did not find the sleeves tight and I don't have tiny arms.
Product was sewn incorrectly on the right shoulder causing it to itch/scratch. The product was smaller than expected.
"Colors ran and ran and ran. Very disappointed. Its cute, but now very dingy looking."
"it went to pieces in 1 week very bad quality. The shoes are low quality I used it only several times.after 1 or 2 weeks it
went to pieces."
Certainly not as advertised.  Poorly made.
"Too large, I would need to wet and place in dryer a few times, not sure if that would make a difference.. Would not purchase again.."
Nice print etc ; BUT they do run smaller ... probably should order at least One size larger if not two sizes larger ...
"The back of this dress fit me the way that it fit the model in the photo, yuk! I'm a size 8-10, 5'9"" tall, a 36G and consider myself nicely curve-atious. I order a medium and this dress was a hot mess on me. It was awkwardly long, big in the waist and yet bunched around my lower back. Just plain strange. I sent it back."
threw away
"Quality shirt that is way loo huge. Not everyone with a big neck size is 300 pounds. I am 5'9"" 225."
just cheap looking
They are 'stretch' so I expected them to fit a bit snugger then say the Aura Instantly Slimming.  What I didn't care for was how thin and flimsy the material felt.  Definitely not enough 'jean' feel for me.  I'm tough on my jeans and need the material to be able to hold up.
"Really attractive sandal, but too long and too narrow even with the adjustable strap. I returned them."
"Every single jeans and shorts I own from Lee are 6. Theses are very off for Lee sizes and I need a 10. I ordered more Lee shorts when I ordered these, the walking shorts and the skimmers, and I wear 8 in those, so they must have changed the sizing (it doesn't make sense that I have gained weight because I fit other Lee size 6 jeans and shorts with no problem) so be warned you may need to order a few sizes up."
Strunk when washed
"These are not comfortable and do not hold my foot to the sole of the shoe causing the irritating flipping noise, the reason I don't wear flip flops.  I will return them when I find the receipt"
"Returned, didn't fit the hubby.  Easier to buy when I have his body to try it on."
Very cheap. For a costume it served it's purpose but it really looks like a toy.
Watch is OK. but the leather strap is very light and low quality
Wouldn't close. Terrible quality.
Super cute and just feels small for ordering a large
"I like the minimalist concept.  So far im ok with this.  Im a bit worried that the nylon material will hold up to everyday abuse.  I haven't seen anyone with this yet so it has the cool factor.  Taking cash in and out of wallet is definitely more involved with this.  I read somewhere that the most minimalist wallet is an elastic headband or rubber band lol but this is much hipper.  Cards develop a bend in them when placed in this so I don't like that so much.

**UPDATE** So this wallet ended up lasting about 6 months for me.  It started unraveling from the bottom and just got worse. It was clear it wasn't going to last long term so I tried another minimalist wallet (radix one). At least the radix addresses the issue of easy access to cash.  I wouldn't recommend this Infinity wallet"
"I ordered these in ""ivory"" but they arrived in bright white.  I was going to return them, but didn't have time to purchase another pair for our event.  After just an afternoon tea, the gloves were trash.  All the elastic was fraying and the lace was fuzzy.  Now, I regret not returning them for sure. As a side note, these did fit my 10 year old well, so they are on the small side."
I am always very critical when buying shoes online. If one of the shoes are not EXACTLY the same size as the other.... they go back!
"I purchased this shirt to go along with another similar shirt for my 1 yr old who is sharing a party with brother. While the graphic is great the shirt measurements and shape are way off. It is 2-3"" wider than other 4Ts we own. The seam that rests on shoulder should be shorter so it stops where the should bends and arms starts. The sleeves aren't angled down like most if not all other shirts we own. He looks likes he's wearing a box.  Where the birthday is in 6 days I doubt I could get another one in time. An exchange probably wouldn't matter as a 3t would probably be short and just as boxy. I spent $10 for shirt $7 for shipping both of which were too much but I justified it as special occation. And now I have to take to a seamstress or find something else in time for ? $. I wrote the seller tonight so see what happens."
It is too short I thought it would be long enough I will give it to someone that can use it
We had to return these shoes because they were way too big.
this is laying in a bottom drawer collecting dust. It is definitely not meant for gals with large breasts. There is just no support. no matter how tight i got it the front continued to fall forward under the weight of my 42DD breasts. very disappointing.
"it was way to small for a man to wear i didn't like it all, but since the person in my secret santa list order it that way I gave it to him, but if it was for me I would return it"
"They fit perfect until they were washed then they shrunk 2 sizes , I guess now they will be used as expensive wax towels."
"Fabric is very cheap, doesn't look nearly as crisp as the picture. No warmth at all either. Would not recommend.."
"This was not pure white like in the picture, so it didn't work for my costume"
If I was in 3rd grade these would of fit perfectly!
Can't stand these boots I love UGGs but I don't like these they were hard to get on and just fit awkward
"I bought a pair of these boots back in 2011 and they have been great.  I ordered a new pair, same size, and they are much smaller.  The shank is so small that it leaves a gap with the tongue.  I am guessing that the supplier changed because of the marked difference in the boots."
"Thought these would be high quality considering they were Sorels, however the interior lining is already coming off... like unattached to the slipper. I have a similar pair from Colombia and they are 100% better."
"Really poor quality. The gloves were delivered with snags and pills everywhere. It looked like someone rubbed a pumice stone all over them. I'm not sure what happened during the manufacturing process, but it should have been damaged out. I didn't send them back because I don't have time to get a new pair before my daughter's prom... I'm just going to try shaving the damage off or something. The color was very pretty."
The posts are tiny and the backs are miniature. Not what I expected or can use. The ball is normal size so I see no response for the whimpy posts and backs.
Very cheap material and too thin. They do not wash up very well.
Don't like the wires in front stick out my shirt its look like it im Cari something in the middle of my chest hate it very uncomfortable and the hoops of the bra go all the way in top of my back.
"These are gorgeous, so this breaks my heart... I MUST return them! The sizing is so ridiculous on these! The left fits perfectly... exactly like a perfect size 5, and with the right foot shoe... I cant even fit my toes in! I am a perfect size 5 and every pair of Jessica Simpson heels has fit me PERFECTLY until these!  It's as if they made a mistake a put a size 4 or 4.5 in the box by mistake. I'm very sad to send these back."
Straps feel too bulky for a 20mm watch. Good quality but too bulky. What's the point if I am not going to put them on? Might have been better with a 20mm watch with a large face? My seiko watch looks comical with all that strap and smaller black bezels.
"Beautiful! Absolutely stunning! I liked the look of them so much I almost kept them. Almost. I wore them twice before giving up. They gave me hot foot, and I am not prone to getting hot feet, so that's a problem. I couldn't enjoy myself in them because I was constantly looking for excuses to sit so I could take them off. Wearing socks helped a bit, but these aren't  shoes that look particularly good with socks. Hopefully this isn't a problem for others, because they are beautiful."
"I have baby fine hair but lots of it and it's about waist length. I am not on city water and have a well with water that is not softened. I mention this because I've found that with some shampoo, the water does matter. I've had my stylist use a shampoo on me that I loved in the salon (which is on city water) but didn't like as well once I used it at home.

I used this shampoo 4 times and unfortunately every time it made my hair very ""flyaway"".....not frizzy exactly because I don't have enough curl in my hair for it to frizz but I found if I wanted to pull it up in a bun/ponytail, I had lots and lots of individual hairs that were unruly and wouldn't stay in the ponytail but sort of floated around my head and normally I don't have this problem with my other shampoos.

Although I loved the scent - it was sort of a minty/botanical kind of smell, I would have had to use hairspray to keep it from floating/flyaways and I hate hairspray and only use it if I absolutely have to. I also tried using other styling products to reduce the flyaways but since my hair is fine, it doesn't take much before my hair seems weighed down.

If you have hair that's not fine and have softer water then this might be a shampoo you'd like but it just wasn't for me."
Did not receive the same patterns as pictured! I received duplicate rainbow and no red and white polka dot. Dissapointed as it also was a week late in arriving!!
is very small !
"I had to return them, way too small"
"Beautifully cute and fluffy... I bought these for my brother's birthday, and he's carefully worn them around the house, no rough stuff or going outside. This is the third day he's worn them, and the back seams on both slippers were burst open by ten o clock this morning - there was hardly any seam allowance, and they began fraying instantly. I could barely sew them back together! How much would you be willing to pay to have functional slippers for 2 days? NEVER AGAIN!! $10 would have been too much, but $28? I've been robbed."
"These are nice sneakers, but they are miserably uncomfortable! If you don't walk too much in them, fine... otherwise be prepared to have achey feet.  I would not order this brand again."
"The color is quite different than the picture (it's a light, cheesy blue), and the material is VERY rough and scratchy. It looks okay on but I don't think I'll be able to wear it due to the material."
I'm only putting 2 stars because my son hated when I would put this on him. It was a struggle and it felt like it was tight getting it over his head. He's not a chunky boy. I think he is more comfortable with something that opens down the middle instead of having to pull something down over his head.
Color different from picture
Cheaply made and the belt loops broke when my boyfriend was trying to adjust the sizing straps. Spend a little more for a better quality product.
Horrible. Bought these for myself and when they finally arrived they were so freakishly small that they couldn't even fit on my 10 year old cousins head. Don't know how these could possibly fit anyone. Do not but them it really isn't worth the risk.
these slippers are pretty good although too big to wear comfortably.  Then they stretched out after one wearing around the house. Thin fabric.  Returned due to size issue.
"Very narrow, poor quality with a useless paper thin insert with zero arch support."
Runs extremely small compared to other brands.
"Terrible quality, super cheap material."
Really poor and cheaply made. Don't waste your money on these socks.
It didn't look like the picture.. It is small and cheap looking...
I didn't like how these fit. I felt like there was a shelf right before my toes- like there was a drop off and my toes weren't supported. I didn't like that and I ordered the Asics Zaraca 2 instead and love them.
"These tights aren't aligned right. Like the cat faces won't be on the front of your legs, they are crooked off to the side."
They are great looking sweatshirts. Unfortunately the wires are flimsy and then it just shorts out and the light doesn't work. The customer service is great and tried to send a new battery pack but won't fix the wire issue.
The underwear are made out of very cheap material. The are like women panty hose. I'm really disappointed when it comes to the material. The got is exactly what I wanted though.
"Very unflattering even with belt, looks like an over-sized nightgown. sent back immediately!!!"
I ordered the 22 inch and the 14 inch came. It did come several days earlier but once the wrong 1 came i had to jump through hoops to get a return label then buy a new package to send it back in. It was however very shiny I wished it was the right size!!! You can't beat the price. I sent the wrong size necklace back the next day so we will see how long it takes them to receive and replace then send it back. I will say the seller was very nice and apologetic and said it was a glitch in amazons website cause I would have never ordered a size 14. So beware if you order this .. make sure it's the right size!
Its run Too Small I'm trying to contact the seller but it doesn't have any email were I can contact them I'm really dissapointed
I love this purse. For the money I spent on it you'd think it would be great but the leather on the strap is hanging by a thread. I haven't this purse for long and it does that. Very disappointed.
"Much too small! I ordered (size 24 months) this 3 months ago and am now ordering one 3 sizes bigger (4T), no growth spurt either - it's just super small, cute though"
"Too sheer material. Looked very cheap on me, but the fit is flattering."
"No support. The length was a little short, but the heels were wide at mine were slipping out. Cute style."
Made in Viet Nam
"I love the variety of colors it comes in but its just too ""rough"" on my woman parts, wish you had cotton material, would surely purchase more!"
"Was to small, my daughter loves emoji things and she's in middle school.  I should have stuck with what I thought.  The bag is not big enough for middle schoolers work.  They have to many books. I tried to tell her. It'll be perfect for some one in grade school though.  The backpack in itself is perfect."
Got a large but chest portion is too tight.
"This slides off all the time with practically no movement. Could definitely not wear at the gym.  Cant even wear it to hold my hair back to wash my face. I have a big head, i admit it, lol. But this thing would be a waste for most people. In my opinion of course. Material is nice though."
These are adorable but do run narrow. My biggest complaint is the zipper won't stay up. I'm very disappointed because the boots look so cute but need to be functional and comfortable for an active three year old.
"Pretty but way too small in cups. Band way to stretchy, no support."
The head opening is very snug for my son. Since they were so inexpensive I will keep them but I will probably cut the collar and he can wear them as undershirts.  My son is 5 I purchased the 7. He is the second smallest in his K class.  It fits loosely and fine everywhere else. Not super soft material just okay.
"Poorly made, came with a scuff on the shoe, and at least a size to small --- totally useless; will need to return."
The color was more neutral/brownish than pictured and the fabric is noisy and stiff. I returned it.
Came with 2 holes in the butt. Very soft and silky but the quality control is questionable
Sizes run way smaller than expected.
"I didn't want to believe one of the other reviewers, that these are not Liverpool jeans, but now I have to agree. The tags, pockets, lining and button are not at all like my other Astrid jeans. The pockets are half the depth and there's not that nice stretch in this fabric. All my other LP jeans have a Beatles song title inside and the flag pattern but these do not. Are they knock-offs?"
"Tarnished after wearing it once.  Such a shame because other than that, I loved it!  Sigh."
Size was 2X received 2X but fits more like XL.
The earrings were 2 different sizes and it was noticeable. I asked my boyfriend and he said they were 2 different earrings. Regardless they were pretty and I still wore them.
The designs on the sleeves and skirt look like soot smudges. It's also very short
"Ordered a size 5, and were too big."
"I gave them to my 21 year old grand-daughter she spend the whole thanksgiving day pulling on them.  She said they were so uncomfortable.  if your a M maybe the XL might fit.  I do not recommend them.  For the money $32.00 they are terrible buy.
If not because I pass them on I should have returned them.  Buyer beware.

MS"
"This is my third and this one was about 3 sizes to small.  I order one of these about every 6 months. I'm in
the water 2 hours a day 4 days a week, and the chemicals in the pool rot the seam threads. This is the first I've had
size problems with.  Fits my wife so not a complete waste."
Not what I expected and they don't even match in size. The halter (bra) is way smaller that the bottom.
"Love the style and wish they fit more comfortably.  The styling is just so edgy and cool but made by a quality brand.  I have high arches and this boot did not have enough support for me.  Also, the inner soles felt a bit too stiff for me. I own some uggs so I guess maybe I might be used to the squishier feel."
Uncomfortable. Cuts into my toes.
just to small of a boot.  Looks great though!
"Listing says sizes 6-8,  ita a size XS.  XS is not a toddlers 6-8.  Very misleading.  Doesnt fit."
way too big! No shape at all!
These shoes are too big which is unusual for.j41s. They are loose.and boxy with no support.  I am.returning them.
"This is the last pair of Levi's I will ever purchase.  Since moving their operation overseas, the quality has gone to trash.  The outer seam on one leg is so crooked that it literally crosses over part of my kneecap when I sit down.  Very uncomfortable, to say the least.  Sadly this is not the first pair of Levi's that have had issues like this.  Levi's, you sold your soul to save a few bucks and you've lost a long time customer for good.
And for the record, I did not feel that returning them for another pair was worth the effort.  I've been foolish enough in trusting this brand.... no more!"
"Heads up... these are so small in sizing compared to other brands...
Be aware that you need to be very slender .....
Return was efficient.."
"this arrived ten sizes too small with a ""yard sale tag attached"""
"Great shoe and appears comfortable. Dont think they were new as ordered, arrived with toe prints and scuffed bottom in generic box. A shoe that is comfortable enough to be worn all day without your feet becoming tired.  the wedge is high but comfortable."
"I read some reviews (not on Amazon), where people complained that nano 4.0 are too stuff and rigid.  I should've listened to those reviews!  These are definitely not ""barefoot-like"" shoes.  At least there's no ""ground feel"" when the sole is stiff as a board -- that's for sure.  And the top is also too restrictive.

There is no arch support, which is to be expected.  But that in itself doesn't make a shoe to be minimalist. Overall, I think this is not a minimalist shoe.  This is a regular stiff shoe with zero drop, but very stiff and fairly thick sole.

Comparing it to nano 3.0, I see a definite turn for the worse, which is too bad, because I'm badly in need of new crossfit shoes."
It is different from the picture and the fit ran small. I gave it away.
"No crown. There is no way no one knew the crown was not in there. It had clearly been opened, taken out (probably tried on), shoved without care back in the bag. I hate being lied to.
I do not hate the dress itself, so it gets two stars. I am 5'6, 34DD, curvy and currently over weight (to help you get an idea of what body type I am judging for). The dress fits me rather well. Perfectly floor length in flats so if you are tall and against showing your ankles do not get this dress. The bust is a bit tight on me. It is a stretchy material but if you have breasts larger than mine you probably should not bother having this shipped to you.
In order to get the poof at the shoulders they put in about a four inch long super itchy material underneath the dress. If you wear this for a night without something between your skin and this material you will probably be uncomfortable with bright red shoulders.
99% sure I will be returning it."
Beautiful earrings but I can't wear them. The post is as small as the earring itself so tge post either pulls all the way down or the earring goes through your ear.
Come up to high on the waist.
"As others have noted, these are not as soft as they used to be.  However, this is not because these are knock offs, but rather these are from Hanes.  I ordered some directly from Hanes.com and they are the same.  Still, they are ok for the price."
I really liked this shoe but I tried it in two different sizes and it runs extremely small. Unfortunately I had to return it twice.
"Horrid. The base seems great, but if you have shape it rides up badly. The arms are a nightmare material stiff, tacky, itchy, and the prongs are a gold plastic that look like a child's toy gone very wrong! Don't waste your money especially if you are tall fit and curvy."
"Well....these earrings are very thin, light-weight, and fragile. If yoyr a heavy handed person, I wouldnt recommend. I hate the hassel of returning, so Ill keep them til they give."
"After 3 months of running, five days a week, the fbric next to my pinky is torn"
Looked at this a long time because I like the face shape. Finally got it at a good sale price and I am disappointed. The bezel has no sparkle and the clasp sticks and is cumbersome. It has a cheap look to it. This ended up not being a good buy at all and if I had paid more for it I would have boxed up the next day and returned.
First time through the wash all three of these shirts shrank by about a size and a half. A pity the quality is so sub-par because the shirts do look very nice. If you're going to buy I recommend going 2 sizes up.
Don't like the unisex sizing.  They may work for the men but they are way too large inside for smaller size women. The shoe itself was good.
"Pros: the fabric is thick and fully opaque

Cons:
1. Very cheap fabric that feels like hard paper.
2. I ordered black, but it's more like a washed out/dull black (see image)
3. The fabric has these tiny little snags all over it.
4. The cut is TERRIBLE. Unless you have a super wide ass/hips in proportion to the rest of your body, this cut is not for you. I ordered a small but the hip area is like a large. To put this in perspective: Think Taylor Swift torso with Kim Kardashian hips and butt. Terrible.

Sending back immediately"
Didn't like this item it was very shiny looked very cheap I actually sent this bracelet back ..didn't look anything like the other Alex and Ani bracelet I bought at the same time...
"Cheapest material, not even close to satin like.  Don't waste your money"
First time buying this brand and this is a horrible shoe. This shoe ripped at the bottom seem after a rainy day. I only at the shoes for about two weeks at the time. Shame because they're cute and make my feet look small. I classify these as junk and don't recommend them.
These shoes are incredibly narrow. They look silly on me and my feet aren't that wide. I would only recommend purchasing these if you have absurdly narrow feet.
"The cut of this product did not look right on my frame.  I ordered the medium, and while the length and width were fine on me, the neck line and armpits were both way too high and look odd.  The fabric made me sweat as soon as I put it on, and it is soooo rough on my skin!  Sending back ASAP!"
"The ring I received was the wrong size, so it was too small.  It didn't look like the picture, - I understand that photos of jewelry are enhanced - it had a different cut.  It didn't have diamonds.  It was a disappointment.  I returned it and all was well."
My toodler is 3 years i bought 3-4 years but its too small !!! :(
Comfortable and a good fit but the fabric has become nubby after 3 wearings
When I walk on hardwood floors they wobbles. Carpet is fine. The heels need to be a little bigger.
"The fit of this bra was really strange. I followed the size guide, and had been measured the previous day so I believe I got the right size, but the fit was all wrong-baggy in some places, tight in others. Also, I found that this bra was very thin and offered almost no support. I wouldn't have worn it out of the house, and it wasn't comfortable enough to use as a sleeping bra. I returned it."
This is not my first Vitalio Vera purse so I trusted their quality. Unfortunately the main zipper broke right away. If I get it repaired I would still like to use the purse because I do like the design.
"No instructions on how to put on, the idea of them is well, but they do not hold up, and if you ""cut to size:"" they fall apart."
Heel fell off.
Way tooo small definitely not a one size fits all
Not a good one. I have so many tops from Patty and i do love all of them but this one is very bad. I wish i can return it but is realy expensiv for me to send it all the way back . And is a risk that will never recieve it so i don't take the chance. I live in europe.  Wish i could change this top on something else from Patty and don't have to pay again for shipment to Norway. Is just horrible
Sizing was small and material was not of good quality.
"The item was not as pictured, it has feet.  I bought this one specifically because it didn't have feet.  Also, my daughter is 34 months old & average size but this item it a bit snug so she won't be playing with it very long.  I only kept it because she saw it...."
"THIS COMPANY IS A RIP OFF . I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR FOR A WATCH I BOUGHT HERE ON AMAZON.  THIS SELLER CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!!! THE 5 YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY IS A JOKE.  I DID SENT THE DEFECTIVE ITEM  FOR SERVICE AND THEY SEND ME BILL $55.00  FOR BATTERY REPLACEMENT.
IT IS A VERY NICE,  FOR $85.00  WATCH I HAVE TO PAY $55.00  SERVICE CHARGE."
"I am not sure what the issue is with Skechers and these type of flat, slip-on type shoes, but this is the fourth time I have ordered the correct size and they are just so loose that I can step right out of them.  It is a cute style, don't get me wrong, but safety is of a concern.  I was not comfortable ordering one size down because I can fit in their non-slip on styles perfectly.  I am not sure if I am the only one with this issue, but unfortunately, personally they are not for me. I have handed over a couple 8.5's to my daughter who is a 9 and they fit fine on her.  Go figure?"
The length from the shoulders to the waist was way too long.
"Too long, much longer than descvribed"
These socks are very thin and will not last beyond a few wears and washes. This is not a high quality product.
"I'm not sure if other people had this problem but the soles on my slippers did not grip my plasticky ""linoleumish"" lined closet or tile floor in my kitchen. I had to make sure to walk very carefully after nearly falling after trying these on and walking on my kitchen tile.

The inside wasn't my favorite either. I could feel the seams of the shoe on the top of my foot, and I didn't think the slippers were comfortable. I returned mine."
"Tried these on when I got them and whoa! this cut is definitely for the younger set that want hip huggers! The cut has a very short rise and when I sat down they went right down from my hips to ... well, let's not get personal. Just to say, they rode very low.
Returned them right away. Will be staying with the Haggar slacks as they have longer rise and more adult fit for us older folks! :o)"
"Not the wallet for me.  Way too small.  Not enough card holders for anyone with store discount cards, bank cards and/or credit cards.  You can hold cash, but plan on keeping a bulky key chain ring if you do.  You'll need the extra key chain space for the store discount mini cards."
"This product completely struck out for me.
Firstly, it doesn't fit. The size chart says it should be so-many inches, and it simply isn't.
Secondly, the workmanship on this product is atrocious.
I did nothing but take it out of it's package, and it's already broken. I unzipped it, that's all.
The zipper was incredibly hard to make unzip. And the seam next to the zipper is completely broken. The stitching is very poor.
I'd be happy if the only problem was it not fitting. I'm dieting and should be able to fit in a couple of weeks.
But this thing is worthless to me, right out of the package."
"Great watch, I don't know why more watch makers don't make watches like this anymore. It was overpriced and made in China, but it functions well, keeps time accurately, and hopefully will continue to work well for years to come (you never know with Chinese made stuff) but for the price, and given that it is mechanical, it ought to last for the rest of my life. The wrist strap that came with it is too soft to be usable; but, I replaced it with a cheap NATO strap and it looks nice.
UPDATE: I've had this watch a little over a month and it's already broken. The gears in the winding mechanism are going to strip and break. DON'T BUY THIS WATCH!"
Nice looking hat but when I received it the chain was broken.
i did not like
I had to return it.  It was way too small.  It looked like it would fit a small 10 year old girl with no boobs
for slimmer foot. D width isinaccurate
The sizing chart for this item is wrong..  the size I got according the size chart was x-large instead of large
"Way to SMALL, These didn't benefit my son at all. What a waste of money. I mean come on now, everybody doesn't where a size MEDIUM. Some people actually have wide feet, meaning that they  require a WIDE WIDTH SHOE. Don't get me wrong Sanuk, is a WONDERFUL CO. an all 5  To them. However these ONLINE  SHOE COMPANIES need to do better, I mean it 's just ridiculous that I have to go in an actual store to find my child Wide Width Shoes not to mention finding him Flip Flop is like a joke. WHATEVER happened to size 11 e for example? If I do just so happen to stumble across a pair of "" 11 e's "" the price starts at around $ 34.99 up to $80.00 or more REALLY  It's like being punished for having larger feet, which isn't right. So all in all once again 5  'S for Quality no Stars if I could for fit."
I bought this fanny for backpacking in asia. It has an amazing design but broke literally 24 hours after I started my trip
"I bought my normal size which is 32D.
Really gorgeous color and style but the fit is just terrible. Smaller in the cup than expected and gives my breasts an odd, unflattering shape. The cup material also has no stretch which I find to be an impractical feature on unlined bras. I definitely would not pay full price for Panache bras after experiencing the irregular fit they offer."
"Waited forever for these to arrive; thought I had ordered one green, one black, but apparently there was a mistake so I received two of same item! They were very nice looking and fabric would have been great too had they fit!  WAY TOO SMALL! NOT AMERICAN WOMAN SIZES! NOT TRUE TO SIZE! American Women wear PLUS SIZES and despite stating they were 1 or 2X or Plus, they were way too small for Plus sizes!
Company was very understanding and considerate!"
they look cheap and the leather is too hard
Feels like paper bag
"i don't like ,this Clothes wrinkle easily"
"Nice inexpensive ring, but looks like what it costs."
"I love the underwire, the concept is almost perfect for my perfect nursing bra and it's super cute! However, It hurts my side as it is has a soft wire on the sides! I compared it to my favorite VS, and the difference is that my VS doesn't have the side soft wire that created the pain.
If you can take out those side soft wires on the side of the bras, I'll buy again for sure."
"I've had this umbrella for three years but have only used it a few times.  Currently I am taking an antibiotic that causes sun sensitivity so I am using my Coolibar umbrella regularly for the past several days.  The slide mechanism used to open and close it just snapped off.  Now the only way to keep it closed is by holding it down while tightening the Velcro closure straps.  For an otherwise nice umbrella, that essential piece is cheaply made and should be made of metal."
"I bought this show on 12/31 and my son has been wearing 3 months and he advised me today that the sole came off the shoe!
I would expect a New Balance shoe to last longer than a little over 3 months.  I would give this show one star at most."
"Really sad they did not fit. Can i send back?
Too small"
"I am returning these......there is nothing really wrong with them, they just seem really cheap and they are huge."
Jeans are nothing like the original.  Very thin and cheap! Extremely dissapointed...
Was not the color as shown.  More dull blue and the numbers/hands were white not black like picture.  Don't care what color the numbers/hands are but made me think I got the wrong watch sent to me.
cheap material. one side was larger and the other was shorter.
"Poor quality, oddly oversized collar, bad purchase."
Does not look like the pic looks like something from the Dollar Tree
I purchased these pants for my husband's birthday after seeing the many advertisements on TV about their comfort.  When they arrived we were not impressed at all--they were too large and sloppy looking.  We had to return them and ordered Levi 505s with the same measurements and they fit just fine.  Watch sizing.
"I wear a size 11 shoe and just out of the package the socks were smallish but were still acceptable. After the first wash, though, they shrank a lot (they were not dried in the dryer but on a clothes line) to the point they are unwearable for me. I will be donating them to the Goodwill and look for a different brand."
"Too tight around the crotch area and it's not only me.
My friend got the same one and we have the same problem.

Was this made for girls?"
Fits like a small. Sleeves are awful. Tight are the shoulder down to the elbow then loose. Super bad sewing job! Don't buy. Picture is misleading!
the item is not as described is very small
"Supima cotton is an exceptionally comfortable material for these trunks. It is super soft and luxuriously cozy. However, the high quality materials are wasted on the poor design, which leaves little room for accessories.

The stylish logo and lettered waistband are attractive features. The fanny sits a bit low. Its large tag is rather cumbersome, as well.

I fell in love with the soft cotton, then grew weary of the lot as I looked back at my traditional brands. Comfort is a must with underwear, but my Lacoste trunks are horribly uncomfortable. I highly dislike them."
Would've given 5 stars but I only received 49 when I payed for 50. Rip off
"I was concerned from reading other reviews about the poor quality, I thought maybe they were being harsh. But seriously, unless you're using this for like a highschool play and you need a CHEAP dress that looks ""fancy"" from AFAR, don't waste your time (or money). Also, when I opened the packages I was smacked by what smelled like melted plastic, something awful. This is a really sad and deceptive sell."
The she quality was horrible and appeared to be cheap. Strings was having from the material of the shoe. It didn't fit on my leg property.  The middle section of the gladiator shoe was way to big. Overall I say do not buy and their return policy requires 20% restocking fee even though I was ready to return day off shipping.
I don't love
I wear XL.  Because of what others said I ordered XXL.  It's still too small.
bad i not time
They were too short so I returned the shoes.
"Great price and looks very nice but doesn't hold up well. The strap completely broke off in a few minutes after my baby tugged at it a couple times. Threads were popping out of the middle. It is kind of a one time use product, but what can you expect at that price. The color is very nice and true to the picture though."
"I returned this. It was not comfortable at all, when buying crocs you expect comfort."
Didn't read reviews daughter swimming in pants more like medium equivalent to size 10/12
"I put tight shorts on over top to hold them up, I never saw anything like it.  I would not recommend to anyone.  They do have the perfect print for the Wicked Witch of the East costume.  Buyer beware."
I received this shirt and it was way too small.  I am a small female vand this shirt fit like tights.  As i was trying to take the shirt off it ripped down both sides of my stomach.  waste of money!!
To tight & I wear 7 :(
Started to come apart after less than one month. Worthless.
"I got the dress but no belt! Where is the belt?  The dress itself, lovely and fits well."
They like to pull Downs's you move. The top band curls under my stomach. Annoying jeans
The toe box is very narrow even though I bought the wide width.  They were uncomfortable because of that.
Shoes just did not fit my feet. Pressed in all the wrong places.
hate the mesh.. too loose!
"Cheap, material was raggedy!"
"Not the best quilty  sawing.  Running small even on XXL.

Discounted price in exchange for review"
I am becoming a believer in American made products more and more everyday. This bracelet was a piece of garbage and the clasp broke the first time I put it on
Didnt work i had to fix it.
"No matter their shape or color, if the size 34 pants fit like 32's, they are not pants."
"It is not nearly as sturdy as I expected...I am returning it, as I am afraid it will rip.  It could also use more compartments."
Worse looking pants I've bought. If I had kept the packaging I would have returned them.
These were cute but run waaay too small. Wish I could have kept them for my wedding day but had to return them. I bought a 9 and it felt like an 8. If your getting these id recommend getting an entire size up.
"BUYER BEWARE! I know that a $7 price tag is always a warning, but I at let expected one wear out of this blouse. Fresh out of the package, the trim at the top of the blouse had already pulled away in two places, which tore the tissue-thin material. So sad that garbage like this is even listed on Amazon."
Fit but was way too tight. Had to send it back. I suggest ordering up a size or going for a wide.
"Really cute, but really cheap. After a few days, the zipper broke and I had to cut a hole by the turtle head to get out the toy that my little girl placed in there because she was screaming and crying when it broke. She still loves it and says turtle to it all the time and wears it around the house. Think of it as a cheap toy, but not something that would be functional to use to go to school or the park. It will break quickly, it's just a matter of when."
Arrived crushed and couldn't get it fixed. A shame because I was really excited about it but ended up returning it.
"When I received it, there is a green marker stain on it... and it's a lot smaller than I thought it'd be. Too short and feels tight."
"If you are 5'2"" and don't weigh over 150lbs, you might be able to wear the size large. I thought that because of the elastic waist band and the material body that it might stretch enough to fit a US size large. It fits like a girls size not a juniors or woman's size. It is a nice footless tight."
"Smelly Belt, put in sun for days but always smells like mildew"
Uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend. I've gotten rid of all of these. Too stiff and give me blisters.
"I bought these boots in grey, and they fit perfectly. ALL of my steve madden size 7 shoes and boots fit PERFECTLY. These do not. I CAN'T EVEN GET MY FOOT INSIDE THE BOOT.

In addition to not even being able to PUT MY FOOT INSIDE THE BOOT, the material they are made out of is so cheap- it's not the same material as the other pair I own. The stitching is terrible. Did the send me some s***ty knockoffs? I think so. I'm pretty pissed that I can't return them because I missed the 'return window' by a few days. I didn't get to try them on until it was too late. I'm APPALLED at the AWFUL quality and craftsmanship of these boots."
Not comfortable for swelling feet.
I did not receive the right product and the fabric was not nearly as soft as I expected.
"Rain coats are to repeal water not soak it up like a sponge.. Very disappointed in carhartt, ... Don't buy this coat if you have to work out in the rain you will get wet ...."
"Piece of crap, turns within days time...as I read other reviews, didn't want to chance it...looked like .99 STORE Merchandise!"
"Sad I had to return these. They are great quality material, not too thin like other linen pants are. Color is a perfect cocoa brown. The hips and thighs are very slender fitting. My small teen daughter tried them and they were to tight on her too."
"Was not disappointed with this watch although the face is a bit larger than I like. The extra straps in various colors was an unexpected surprise for me.very pretty mother of pearl face.
update.. after only wearing a few times the face of watch became horribly scratched. unfortunately window to return is expired.i am i changing my previous rating from four stars to one. i did not abuse the watch and only wore to work( in office) a few times. looks like it has been dragged across the pavement. don't know how this happened..has never happened before with any watch ive ever owned,very aggravated and disappointed because i really liked this watch and now this company wants 28.00 to repair."
does not look like the picture at all! returning it
They are cute if you want to wear it once and the ear cuff doesn't look right at all. Broke 2nd day I wore them.
"In heather oatmeal this looks like a pj top and it isn't fitted like the picture. It's more ""heathered"" than shown too and for me, this sheds some style points. I used the size chart to order a small, but it was very, very large. My man thought I bought it for him to lounge in. Two stars for soft fabric."
Strap broke first day
I ordered size L and it fits a size Small
The shoe runs small.  The bottom of the shoes are very slick.  I almost fell while trying them on the carpet.  I returned them.
At first I loved these. Then I wore them in the sun which caused my feet to sweat and I developed HORRIBLE blisters which have just now finally healed after maybe a month and have left terrible scars.  I will never wear these again which is sad because they are adorable!
"once i put an orthotic inside, the boot fit well - it's quite wide even for a snow boot.  havent' given it the outside in the snow test yet - but they're warm in the house.  these replace a 5 year old pair of merrells that finally let my toes get cold.

update:  today i wore them in serious weather for the first time.  they are comfortable - but i was so sad and disappointed that my toes got really cold - even inside the pickup.  these aren't going to work at all for any serious work/play outdoors."
"this smart key is less than 3"", not a single key will fit"
I never felt comfortable in these shoes and they didn't fit right. I returned the first pair and tried another size but they hurt my feet. I put them in the Good Will box and bought a better pair at Penney's.
"Very small.  I wear large in nearly all athletic shorts - could probably fit in a medium in some.  I ordered these in an XL based on reviews.  I returned them as they were way too snug.  The waist was more or less big enough, but these were crazy tight in crotch and rear.  And I have no butt at all."
"Meh. The design is beautiful, the fabric is soft. Color is pretty - perfect for an ugly sweater party.

Except it will only fit you the way it does in the picture if you are the same size as the model. I am 5'6"", 140 lbs, dress size 6-8, and this sweater came down to a normal length, which for me is right below my belly button. It is not skin tight, but definitely tighter than I appreciate. I was hoping it would be massive - I love giant ""too-big"" sweaters. I'm bummed that this sweater doesn't fit the bill. If you have boobs, like anything above a B cup, don't waste your money and time. Besides, it took a month to get to me. Which blows."
"Shoes would fit much better If sent in true size.  With the combination size (9-10), heel does not set and the solar is about an inch or maybe more too long. P
MISSFIT"
"The item was poorly made and had strange fit.  I ordered it yesterday, received today, returning it this afternoon.

One size DOESN'T fit all."
After I washed it it got small and I can't wear it.
I was disappointed because I bought this same tank top at Marshalls in a different color. I ordered here because I wanted black. The tags say the material is the same but the feel is totally different. This one on here being overly stretchy and thin. But the more irritating thing to me was the size was way bigger than the one I bought at Marshall's.
"way longer than i expected. came down past my knees. was made well, just too long."
"These are not as good as the Gildan brand. These FOTL socks pill all over. they are quite loose fitting and thin. The Gildans don't pill (or hardly any), are thicker, and tighter."
Fits smaller than I expected.
Feel much more narrow than my winter Acorns.
The top is way too small.  I'm 5.4 tall.  I weigh 118.  Usually I wear Xsmall on all tops. The waist is very very tight.  It's difficult to breath!
"Ordered the ""Carnelian"" stone, sent me a dull brown stone. Picture shows a beaded silver chain, mine came with a black plastic choker cord. Ughhh. Horrible. The dragon is very cheaply made and has a lot of rough edges on it as well. The ""stone"" is a plastic bead with a hole on both ends that you have to hide. Seriously not happy with quality and the fact that they just sent me any old thing, and didn't receive the silver chain as pictured. Buyer BEWARE!!!"
Shoe is substantially smaller than my other loafers of the same size.
"Ugly, poorly made gloves - no surprise for the price. A good choice if you need a disposable fabric glove"
Bought it for a trip to florida.....shoulder strap Broke on the way back this is more for a gym bag not a travel bag poorly made and one of the zippers is broken too the side pouch can just be pulled open..... Cheap price still not worth it in my opinion....
The band that surrounds the thighs is way too restricting (hurts my butt honestly) although the band at the top (hips) is too loose!
very poor quality/construction.
"Very dissappointed.. I am a Small ordered a ""Large"" so that I could wear sweaters underneath.. received the jacket and it was very small for a large and all I had on was a turtleneck I could barely zipper it closed.  Also Problems with the zipper I received it and returned it the same day.. Not at all what I expected from the reviews.. would not recommend"
"This shirt isn't an epic fail but it comes close.  One the positive side it looks just as pictured--and that's where the good stuff ends!  Hawaiian shirts are usually cut large but not this one!  I ordered a size up (as suggested by reviewers of other products from this seller)  and it still barely fit.  The fabric is very slick and doesn't feel good on my body.  So sad--because it really is a beautiful shirt.  Of course you get what you pay for: this shirt is half the price of most big men's Hawaiian Shirts.  Yes, I'd have returned both shirts but my oh-so-helpful wife un-boxed the order and tossed all the paperwork out. :("
Paper thin . Columbia is my fav but was disappointed in this jacket. Thin and crunchy so I returned it
Not what i was expected.
"I'm switching over to this type of brief after wearing Boxers for 60 years. So far no complaints. I like that they don't ride up.

Update, 11/16: These are constructed and fit the same as Fruit of the Loom but the fly on these is so far over to the right that it is hard to find though your pants zipper. Probably useful for highly active sports but not for everyday wear. I won't buy any more."
You mine as well call the 34 a 32. I could hook it but it is so snug I would never be able to wear it.
"Its really loose and the fabric does not look like the picture. It is very loose and feels okay, but not for long use."
I have had this shoe for years and wear them now.  They are very comfortable.  I think they are not making them anymore.  I was trying to replace the ones I have now. I ordered the same size and I was able to get my foot in but it felt very snug.  The fabric on the shoe on my left foot bent in slightly making it uncomfortable.  I returned them and will look for a different shoe.
"To big, maybe I should have ordered 2 sizes down! Returned it!"
"I am disappointed in these shoes. They are comfortable but they squeak and squeak loudly. When I have worn these out in public I have had many people ask me about why they squeak so loudly. It's embarrassing. I used baby powder and white flour in the shoes, nothing works. Amazon customer service stated that there have been complaints like this in the past. I am wondering then  why these shoes would still be allowed to be sold on Amazon as there seems to be some kind of manufacturing defect? For almost $140 this problem should not exist. If you buy these shoes I hope yours don't squeak."
"If this was a flavor from Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans, the flavor would taste like ""disappointment"". The POS isn't even gold. Wings are plastic with Made in China writing all over them. Wings popped off immediately out of the package. Expecto Dissapointo"
I really do love how they fit and they are super soft.. But the pink ones literally turned my skin pink!! I have washed them multiple times in different ways and it still does it. Not very happy.
"Not a huge fan of the top, it's tall and if you're like me and you have a mommy pouch. You won't like the fit of these. The bottoms are cute for the look BUT they started shedding, like the fabric is cut weird or not sewn.
Grrrrr. Not happy with this purchase. "
didn't fit so I had to return =(
Couldn't snap it in the groves.
"One sentence describes this perfectly. Not meant for a skinny girl at all. It was so baggy at the top, but would almost get stuck on my butt even trying it on both sides. Just saying, I'm 5'3, 85 pounds and my measurements are 33-23-34."
I liked them at first. Thin like I wanted. But after only wearing them and washing them one time they have holes. Have already thrown away 2 pair. Don't waste your money.
The Hutton popes of as soon as I tried them on. Not because they were to tight they must have already been barely sewed on.
"Super cute but the ankle was too small and the beads down the foot were about 1/2 inch too long, making them look silly. I think having the beads be one long piece with a clasp that you can clip anywhere on it, making it adjustable for any size baby foot in a certain range, would make them perfect!"
I have thick hair. I can't wear this thing at all. It's small.
These were tight on my grandson.  He has been wearing 12 months in Carter but we decided to go to 18 months because he seemed to get a little taller.  Anyway I ordered these in 18 months and they fit tighter than the 12 months Carter ones he already had.  The material is so thin that the baby woke up crying saying it was cold.  He is 2 and he has never done that before. I am sending these back.  So I would say with Carter you can never go wrong there.
Awful experience
Made out of te same material as a bathing suit too. Unflattering.
"did not look like the picture, pretty off putting honestly. the shirt was weird and ugly. will never buy from this company again for the false advertising. i don't trust them now."
Not a regular sized BASICS shoe. It was extremely narrow and I had to return it for a full refund
"I wore the shoes one day and they inside starting cracking and a spray paint like smell emitted from the shoe. The black color faded onto my tan colored hosiery and they turned black on the entire foot area. I am shocked after one day wear the shoe would break and peel from the inside. I want to return to the seller and get a resolution, but the return button is turned off. I will probably just return and chalk this as a loss."
The shoes are way too big...ordered a size 9 womens...too large
This dress is pretty cute on but it is not good quality at all. After washing it once it got a hole in the elastic waist part. Not recommended!
"I wish I would of took the reviews into consideration. They sizing is off a bit. The material is very thin, but fir warm summer nights it's nice. The top is terrible. Horrible cut. Very low on the sides and very small cup. The cup coveted barely half my breast, pulling it up I spilled out the side, pulling it down I spilled out the top. I need more material. Not for the busty woman"
Nothing like the photo tiny waist and huge billowing legs. A super funky fit with no crotch room.
They were too small like a watch for a lady...very disappointed...never buy online
keeps fading quicky even after reordering
"Strange extra large boxy shape with tiny arms, short torso.  Beautiful fabric but odd fit."
It is ALWAYS so wrinkled!!
"Great looking product and fit pretty decent, but after the 2nd. Time wearing them the crotch ripped open when squatting down to pick something up at work. These are definitely not as strong as you'd hope work pants would be, it's a shame because they are so good looking and have a good cut to them."
"The shoes were defectively made.  I do believe it was probably just the pair that I received as I have always had a good experience with Easy Street shoes.  I tried to exchange them but apparently they did not have any more because they just credited my account.  So, I lost my shipping charges.  I'll not order from this company again."
"Beautiful color and fit. Unfortunately after wearing it for less than five hours - seating down for most the time- the  shimmer part stretched out so bad. It didn't fit tight at all, the sizing was perfect."
The neck fits much tighter than it appears in the photo. I returned it.
These are ALOT bigger than expected.
"these boots were the worst, in the first week the metal reimforcment shank cut through the sole of the boot, I noticed it when my sock got soak and wet while working in the rain. I love the concept of the zipper but its not worth the discomfort of wet feet, whats the point Yaba Daba Dooooooooo!"
"Way too big in the back, even if you have a nice butt, these would not fit.  Very strange design"
It is not the belts but the  brainless wonder in Mexican customs that rejected them. My nephew did not get a chance to wear them I do recommend the belts but not sending them to mexico
"Product is very thin, fits great,"
I returned this skirt - it was so cheap and I would never wear.
"The color was lost for the first time I cleaned.
It's a very bad color.
I never try this color again"
"The legs were too big and kept wrinkling. The waistband was way too tight and kept trying to roll. I bought my size based on the measurements on the package, And it still didn't fit. On my first night wearing them trying to hitch them up they tore. Ultimately I just didn't like the design. The fabric wasn't stretchy enough, And the waistband was way too tight for the dimensions on the package. I will not buy again."
"the edges of the neck does not have the same size, after what it sees is uneven when you put the tie."
"I needed new jeans and these sounded perfect.  I purchased 2 pairs in 2 different sizes and models and they didn't come close to fitting any which way (and I never count length because I am only 5' with short legs).  I was very surprised and planned to return them but they disappeared.  That is my problem, I don't believe they just vanish.  I washed them before wearing on 2 pair as instructed just as instructed but I couldn't even begin to tell you how they didn't fit, they just didn't."
It was too small for my middle school aged son who has a small to normal sized head for his age.
"A shame really. These boots looked good and were comfy, but as with many other PU products they simply did not last. By that I mean two days. Just sent back now."
"Buying these was a waste of time and money!  I have narrow to normal size feet and wore these only inside the house.  After two weeks, they looked beaten up and worn down , as if they were a year or two old!  Very disappointed.  I should have contacted Amazon on the manufacturer, but did not since it was almost flip flop season anyway.  I wish I could find a good slipper shoe with support that's not overly expensive."
"These are the cutest boots but the quality and fit are poor. The shoe part is short for a size 11, fits more like a 10. For girls with big feet you know how sometimes you can cram your foot into a 10, but you really need an 11 so your toes get mushed. So many brands don't make 11s, which is a major reason I shop online for shoes. Anyway, for synthetic leather they do seem like they will break in a bit. I needed longer laces in order to make them look and fit right, so I ordered a spool of ivory grosgrain ribbon and that did the trick. Now they look less like Mexican wrestling boots. I decided to keep them because they are cheap and cute."
I didn't receive the size I order.  You sent me a smaller size.  ITs to expensive for me to return.  Please be more carefull when fulfilling orders.
Poor quality- fabric pilled and tore after one wash. I washed on cold and hung the top to dry since it contains Rayon and it still started to tear/pill.
Back heated up.  Very hot.  Had to request refund.
Reviews are not for the shoes
"This was just ok for me. It started to tear apart after a week and a half of me using it, and I only used it a few times a week for maybe an hour or two.... The Velcro is good and I liked that you could adjust the waist, but I wish it didn't fall apart... "
"They are so puffy instead of baggy.  They don't look anything like on the picture.  If the material were soft like  jersey they would not puff up, but the nylon type of material doesn't drop at all, so they puff up.  There was not receipt or a return label at all in the package.  I want to return them but don't have instruction.  I'm still trying to check my purchasing record to see what to do with these pants."
Bad quality material.
didn't fit calf. will need to be returned
"cheap price, cheap product...very thin ,not  thick...you get what you pay for...cannot  say anything more  about this product i'm  done..."
Had to return this- the small was way too big. The armpit holes were long and hung on me.
"Way too tight in the ankle, no give."
I am 56 and 128 pounds and it fit OK except for the fact that the shorts part are way too long. It's very awkward  Material feels very cheap
arrived broken. Had to super glue the stone
"Side pieces are only glued onto foot bed.  Broke 1 week after I was unable to return them.  Cute, but not worth the money."
These are vey loud flip flops. I had to return- couldn't stand the slapping sound.
Nice material but too small
"Very sexy dress and a beautiful shade of lavender.

Update! Came apart within a day of using it. Seams just fells apart! Exact same thing happened with my other Allegrance dress, that one was a bit loose but it came apart anyway! Im not having this problem with any of the other body con dresses I ordered from different vendors. These dresses from Allegrance are terribly made and won't last a month. I knew I was buying a cheap dress but I didn't know if have to toss it in a week!"
"It's in the ballpark, but so is smacking stones together.  Don't bother with these.."
"cute but do not have elastic in the waist. after one wash, they no longer hold at the waist."
Looks really cheap!!
Sent them back...weird fit. I had a pair from last year that fit perfectly. Go figure.
"Need to get half size bigger than your actual foot size.  These run tight, messed up my toes, and squeek. "
"Support and quality of this product is fine, but it just squishes your boobs together and makes them look like one roll across your chest.  Not flattering - the effect is similar to a sports bra, except this isn't as comfy."
After washing  these socks shrink down to baby size.  Maybe a six-year-old boy I could squeeze into them.  Most likely they are marketing to the newly emerging Asian market.  The package says size 6 to 12 but I don't think even a size 6 could fit into them.  I am a size 10.
sizes are for over seas.. if you're a plus size don't get it
"It looks like it should fit and adult, but is very small.  Feels like it was meant for a child."
"Way to small, I gave them to my neice."
"I recently went up a half size for more room and comfort. Been wearing New Balance for years in a size 10.5 but after measuring my foot it was obvious I need an 11. Also, I've always bought a 4E in NB shoes and this last pair of 11 4E size I received were very tight in the toe box, putting pressure on my big toe, so I had to return them. I wish these had a more square toe box."
Cheap and not like the picture at all
One of the straps broke after only one month of wearing them. I loved them and was so sad that this happened.
Extremely small....took a LONG time to receive
"Both heels come up out of the boot heel as if walking in flip flops.... too bad, looks like a nice boot.  Front fit fine."
"Got it for my 4 y.old, opened  2 days ago on Christmas morning... Unfortunately the quality of every single item is not good. Half of the under dress skirt not sewn, one button felt off right away when tried the dress on, tiara and wand started loosing the gems first minutes. Gloves lost the bow the next day, they were glued on, not sewn. The dress itself looks good on my daughter, the glitters did not fell off which is nice. If the set did not cost that much would not be so upsetting. Really wanted to love it, looks good on picture and daughter loves it, but was upset that everything started to fall off the first minute."
"i bought this dress and doesn't fit like the model.
i'm 5'5 and wear small regular or medium jr size US clothing. this is a one size fits all.
it looks horrible when i tried on. too short. cheaply made and makes me look big.
i wouldn't waste my money on this dress"
"This really is a nice hat.  my problem, once again (!!) is the sizing unpredictability.  In the last four weeks I have ordered six clothing products.  Five of those six products were either too small, too large or were designed for an alien, not a human.  There is no longer a dependable sizing uniformity in today's clothing industry like there use to be before NAFTA was forced on us.  Clothing companies today have failed to enforce uniformity in sizing and material quality from manufacturers who make their profits by using unskilled workers in third world countries and places like China who does anything it wants to make profits."
Not quality material.
"This turned out to be a waste of money. This thing has a horrible fit and drape. It's also way too long.
Quality of materials is OK, but I wasn't expecting anything that great.
It just drapes so horribly on the human body. You might be tempted to purchase it just to see what I'm talking about. But don't.
When you zip it up, there's too much fabric so it bunches out, creating a huge bump on your torso.
When you unzip it, it hangs limply with no shape or form."
"Was hoping for something similar to latex in shine and texture, but this is just low shine spandex.  Does not appear as shiny as in the sales photo."
If you have wide feet these are not for you.
Too large.  Wishful thinking!
"Silk Touch is false advertising. This some kid of ruffed up cotton. It no way was it comfortable nor was it fashionable. Do not recommend.
HAD TO PAY FOR MY OWN RETURN TO GET A REFUND."
"Nice predictable fit, a wee tad too long (in petite) , and the most irritating thing is the seam smack down the middle. Returned"
Blocks vision when wet.
Love Fossil and wanted to love this but it just looked cheap.
"One of the zippers on the suitcase has already fallen off, and the lock has broken.. Other than that it's fine, just small. The messenger bag is too small to carry my macbook pro."
"Cheap shirt, not worth the money.  But we only purchased for a Christmas party."
His ring I got for my boyfriend as a gift. Hes been wearing it for about a few months and it has these sharp parts on it that rip his finger up. Not a comfortable ring at all. Im getting him a different ring
"I was so excited to get this dress. The materials are nice and thick.
The pleating is a bit odd to be honest.
But the biggest problem is after ONE time wearing this dress, the zipper broke! It was very shoddily sewn where the skirt meets the top."
Way too big for my baby :( it fit on my head!
Its not long enough for my waist and I'm not very tall.
Not plus size. 2xl is probably comparable to a size 12 (which is nowhere near a size 2xl).
"Purchased a medium, they're more like an extra small!"
Have already given as Christmas gifts so I can't return them but they are way too small
Flimsy. These are worse than Hospital shoes.  So flimsy it's like they are supposed to be worn over other shoes.
"My son is just over 2 years of age and yet these socks are too tight on his ankles and fit his feet exactly snug from front to back.. These are rated from 3 to 5 years of age but that does seem to be the case here. My son is not overly large or big and so the ages specified here must be for very small children in these age groups. The anti-slip/non-skid bottoms are not on the ball of the foot or heel where a child needs it as much, if not more, in the arch area. The non-slip area on these socks is found primarily found in the arch area which means there is literally no non-slip protection in the front or rear of these socks. I have watched my child slip and fall in these socks too many times already.

His tears are enough for me to purge these socks and find something else."
"I should have paid more attention to measurements as this piece was substantially larger than I had imagined but that is my mistake and not the cause of the rating. The rating is due to the fact that this is pretty tacky. It's bright ""gold"" and very large and could pass for a set piece from some Indiana Jobes movie. I did consider its usefulness within a survival setting with being able to use the magnifying glass to start a large regional fire and also the ability to ward of predators just due to the sheer tackiness of the piece. The predators would already just feel too sorry for the wearer of this item and thusly not attack. It will be returned and something a little less... Well something just a little less will be its replacement!"
Wrote a review when I received.
I returned this because I like the Peter Grimm hat more. I now own 2 Peter Grimm hats
"The style of this bra gives a pointy, 1950's shape which is not attractive at all. I returned this bra."
i have bought other mountain t shirts in the same size i bought this shirt this shirt however fits much smaller than the others.
"1. Looks good
2. But, hurts ears if you wear it for more then 30 minutes
3. Wont buy again ever"
Returned because of the small size
"I wanted to like it, but the two ends came out of the buckle the first time I went to put it on.  So right now it just junk for me.it looks like the leather was just stuffed in the the buckle ends, with nothing to hold it in.  I don;t normally leave bad reviews, but there was no other option. if the supplier is monitoring these reviews, i am open to working on a replacement."
ran vry small
one star for the color
Fit  was far too small. Material was cheap and see through. There was no way this dress would look like it does in the picture. Returning. You could buy this at Walmart.
As usual way too small and it is heavy
returned looks like it would fit a small child
Dont waste ur money ....it looks like a mechanic uniform
I received this yesterday and wasn't that happy. The material was very stiff and the corset did nothing. I am usually a size 10-12 and this was pretty large on me. It was not very flattering at all. Not sure how they made it look so good on the model in the picture. She is obviously much skinnier than a size 10-12 and it looks like it fits her well.
"I am 6'3"" and a 180 lbs and I wear 34/34 in most jean sizes with room to spare. The thermals according to the size chart said to go with a medium but the length was way to short while the circumference fit from waste to shin ( I say shin because it doesn't reach my ankles and plus you need to consider the cleaning of them ) just fine."
They are shorter and tighter than I was expecting
"Ugly, could not see what it looked like in the photo's.  Sleeves were baggy and did not fit around arms.  Bad product."
I followed the recommendation for sizing and this shoe is too tight and narrow. Returning. The print is also a bit cheesy....I know it's not leather but just looks a bit cheap.
These pants only lasted about a month after wearing them 1-2x per week.  I will not be buying more!
"Works like a belt. Looks alright, color is nice and fabric inside is navy. But not leather when it says so in both descriptions."
"Backlight stopped working after only a few weeks.  I bought this watch and a Casio Waveceptor around the same time.  Both watches cost about the same, but I think the Casio is a much better watch.  I found the Timex a little confusing to use.  It didn't seem to be at all intuitive."
stone came out within a month
"I bought these shoes because I have shin pain when I run and I've done a lot of research that pointed me in this direction. Just walking around in them, they seemed comfortable. Running however is a different story. Within a quarter mile, I felt like there was a large bump pushing on the bottom of my foot. By a half mile, my right foot was numb. They do help with cutting down impact in the heel region, but the heel seems higher than the rest of the foot, and I think that's what causes the numbness. I tried them for a second run and my left foot went numb as well. I did not have them tied too tight. Something about this shoe is just off."
"I will start out with the fact that this is a good looking wallet, however...

This is ticketed as a wallet to fit your front pocket, probably because the money clip on the back protrudes from the wallet about a half inch. I did not like this wallet at all. It's too big for the front pocket. The clip is useless if you want to clip it to your pants pocket because the clip isn't at the very top - you'll have about an inch or more of wallet above the pocket line which looks absurd. If you want to use it in your back pocket you can feel the money clip because the hinge on the clip is actually about 1/2 inch thick and it sticks into your a$$. It looks awesome though and I really wanted this to work for me. Unfortunately there wasn't a pocket that I could make it work in. To boot, just like everyone else has mentioned, the ID slot is TOO BIG for a standard size drivers license. I even tried to pack other cards behind it to keep the ID from falling out. If you don't mind losing your ID and having to spend $100 to replace it, then go right ahead and use the ID slot - Guaranteed it will happen sooner or later. I returned this wallet - still searching for the perfect front pocket/money clip style wallet."
Hard to get on. No give or stretch
"If it would stay in place itd be fine. But, it tends to ride up and twist, Ive worn mine a few times and I always end up having to sneak off to readjust because its coming out the top of my dress."
Didnt like the nylon like material
"Very nice looking shoe, but after my daughter (14 years old) tried them on, they were extremely narrow & tight- painfully. Unless you have narrow feet, avoid."
"Way too big. Beautiful shirt. I ordered a large & medium figuring one of them would fit, I normally wear a large but both of them were extremely large they looked like more like plus sizes"
The shirts were thin..Kinda cheap it seemed. Won't order any more of this brand. Amazon is normally a good deal. Not this one!
"Too tight for stretch fabric. I am comfortable in 38"" Urban Star jeans, less so in this 40"" Wrangler! In addition, legs are too long. Inseam length is close 30"", rather than 29"". Also pretty disappointing design with pocket openings too close to the waistline. All in all, I certainly will not buy another Wrangler jean."
It's transparent and came stained.
"Ordered creme color adult, got white for very small child like 1 or 2 years old!"
My earrings aren't even a month old and the back broke off!!
"Not the expected quality, Cashmere is only part of a blend and not super soft as advertised"
Horrible. Outfit came to me with holes in it. Will never order again.
"I was looking for a comfortable casual shoe. I have N feet and hoped this shoe might fit well, but much too wide for me. Returned."
"For the first three days, the stitching was rubbing against my toes. It went away after I wore them more. There is not enough cushion on the sole. Not a good shoe for walking long distances. Had to wear a band-aid on the back of my heels because the stitching was rubbing against my foot. I thought it would be a similar shoe to the J-41. Very disappointed."
"Quality looks good. But, I ordered up multiple sizes like they said and it is way too small. I'm not talking not fitting over my gut small either. I'm talking tiny sleeve diameter and support narrow shoulders."
"The material is THIN, you wouldn't want to wear this to stay warm,and I can tell that this is going to shrink after the first wash and dry."
Not a bad shoe but very long and  narrow.
"They are cute, but not great quality.  I was also disappointed because the wrong size was sent to us.  We got a pair that was too large, so eventually I guess they will get used."
"These earmuffs are very large when it they are over the ear. Unfortunately, they have almost no padding in them and provide little warmth. They fit comfortably, but don't really do the job that I want a pair of earmuffs to do which is keep my ears warm."
"Not what I expected. The material is very thin and flimsy, and the pants are cut super baggy, like clown pants. I expected the cuffs to close at the ankle, but they don't have elastic and are open at the end. I would have returned them, but just didn't bother, with the shipping and all."
Boot not true to size. I experienced skin irritation too. The  Color was nice...
This piece looked great online but when I opened it up it didn't meet my expectation for quality. I returned it immediately and got my girlfriend another piece of jewelry instead.
Very delicate...i wore it only for once and its broken
"Yep, CAPS are deserved on the SMALL.  I nearly always wait a year before reviewing anything like this, but these things are short.  I can't imagine why they don't correct their sizing.  Started with my standard 10, and my toes were curling to even get in them.  Returned for a 10 1/2, and my toes have perhaps 1/8 inch of room.  Not sure if they'll stretch with use.  I'll report back in 6 mos.

Edit: Downgraded to 2 stars.  Buyer beware.  Nice enough shoes, but the seller is just pushing their wide inventory, instead of the advertised/ordered sizes.  They didn't stretch whatsoever.  They're suitable for slipping on to take the trash outside, but longer trips and you'll be in pain."
Returned to vendor - too small
The black soles on these shoes keeps coming loose and I have to keep gluing them back on. Typically do not have this problem with adidas
"Much smaller than I anticipated and the quality is not what I expected either. I am returning this item to the seller, post haste!"
"The quality of this product is terrible. After one wash, the bibs did not fit and the burp pads shrunk to the size of a napkin. I'm sorry I purchased two sets."
"Extremely long.  Waist extremely low.  Very disappointed.  Couldnt return, live in the Caribbean"
not as comfortable as nike slides and paid 39.99 for this and and the price tag on them was 34.99 come on really
"The fit is akward. The material is stiff, not flowy or soft. The straps are awkwardly large. It's a paint shirt now. Is never wear it out."
These broke apart in less than 2 months.
"34W is a little snug, and they haven't even been washed yet.  Even the belt that comes with it is barely long enough, making it more troublesome to use.  Unfortunately, it's not available in 35W.  Otherwise, length is fine, the fabric is fine, and I like the plastic buttons and velcro closures.  For a comparison, the Levis cargos (both Ace & Squad) are a good roomy fit."
"Fabric is very thin, see through type, not appropriate for work. Size is not accurate. The greatest concern, you must pay shipping to return, I resent this greatly. I will not be shopping with this vendor again, not smart shopping when I have to pay for return."
"They have a brass zipper in the back on the heel that the pic doesn't show. boo.  Also very narrow and small, unlike the other size 7 shoes in my closet ( all fifty hundred million )"
Charts aren't accurate! Revise please. Also arrived late!
These run really small.
HORRIBLE Product. The broke the first time I wore them. I contacted the seller and never heard back. Dont buy.. I guess you get what you pay for!
"The quality is not what I expected and the elephant print is not as depicted, I'm a bit disappointed since I love how it looked in the photos."
Wore once and they scruffed. I had them on for less than 5 hours at a party.
Ordered a large.  Way too small
Like the watch but band is a piece of nothing. And you can't replace it with a standard band. I was tempted to keep it because I like the slim size and the look but there's no point with proprietary band. Returned it for a refund.
no support cant wear them
No respond from seller to return. Material is cheap and its made for a child
"This rating based on the look of these boots alone. I did not like how wide they were at the ankle. They looked awkward with both skinny jeans and a boot leg. More of an all weather boot style, which is not what I was looking for. Also, they were too big overall. I can't rate their performance as I did not wear them. They seem well constructed. I ordered another style of Kalso Earth boots at the same time (Catamount Wedge) love them but they were also to big. I would definitely size down with this brand. I am returning these and exchanging the other style for a smaller size."
"I bought three pair of born shoes from this seller this was the only pair that failed. The heal colapsed 3 weeks in and now they just are not wearable. I inquired about an exchange, but was told to bad so sad basically. Very disappointing. I have a brown pair just like these I bought from the seller a couple years ago, so I know they are made better than pair I got, just sad I spent the money and now I'm stuck with a lemon of a shoe."
"I was a little disappointed that the socks were so thin.  I like a thicker athletic sock, but decided they'd do.  So I washed them in cold water and tumbled dried.  Since I didn't try them on before I washed them, I don't know if they shrunk or if they were just too small to begin with.  But the sock won't fit on my size 9 foot."
"I was disappointed when i got tha watch. It looked cheap w/a a round sticker on the middle of the watch. Ithought it was a sticker w/ some letters on it. I tried to remove it at first. A real bummer,pls. Improve that style."
Too big & heavy
Fit as expected... however hated the material I felt like I looked like a couch lol
I ordered a 44 reg. It was too large and it definitely isn't a tailored fit. I returned it.
UHOH these are the sandals I talked about in another review of a similar clarks sandal- I love the pewter color cut it goes with everything but these sandals did not hang together!!!!
Seem like a nice shoe but size 7 was to small and they don't come in 7.5
liked style but way to small.
"Thought they would be better quality!
Not impressed with UGGS!"
"I really love these slippers, but one foot was smaller than the other!"
"Hope to lose weight and be able to wear it next summer. I'm a 1x, and ordered a 3x but no luck."
"Meh, it is ok. Not as cute as I was expecting. The cut is too curvy and the elbow patches are a little funny. I decided to keep it, but have yet to wear it out of the house."
"While this is a pretty dress, the color is a little off.  The ""apricot"" is way more yellow than expected especially in the sun. The picture does not correctly reflect the true color.  Also, the dress is much longer than shown.  I am 5'5"" and the dress is slightly below my knee.  I ordered a size small and it fits.  I will keep it, I'm just disappointed in the color and length.  I guess you get what you pay for!"
They're very cute but the stone fell out of the ring already .
"Great hoop for the price, but a little heavy on the lobes"
Bought this in a womans small for my 10 year old. it did not fit her! How tiny is a grown up woman supposed to be to fit in this?
"very well made shoe, but the coral was just too bright and shiny for me. I thought it was going to be a Chinese red color, but it is definitely an orange coral. I decided to return them."
Beware of foreign sizing.  This item runs 4 sizes too small.  Otherwise cute top. Disappointed that I could not use it.
It's too short...not like the pic.
Size is accurate. Color a true dark Navy. No pilling or problems when washing and drying.
"The top fits too small and the bottom fits too large - I don't know why, but that seems to be the trend with all pajamas! I got a large and the top is just barely wearable, as it suffers from the teensy-weensy arm syndrome. The bottom has a drawstring - I really hate drawstrings - and without cinching it up, the pants barely hang in there on the elastic waist. It's like having a size 10 top and a size 14 bottom. They're flannel but not super-warm either. Ok for summer / fall wear but not a warm enough set for winter."
"As a slip on shoe, it's not exactly easy to slip on. I still have to hold the shoe to put in my foot. My feet also get hot while on walks.  I'd hope they improve on the ventilation for the next run of this product."
"I searched the Internet for days to find Hanes Our Most Comfortable T-shirts and was so excited when I found them here. Unfortunately, that's not what I received. I got the comfortsoft T-shirts. I'm using them for tie dye so it's not that big of a deal. But the ones I was hoping to get were the softest shirts I've ever gotten and I was looking forward to having more super soft tie dye shirts."
need 12  2A  Wife has white& a black fit perfect but these (purple/pink)to short
"5'11, 32""W - fit is a little small"
Good panty
"Ordered a kid's XL for my 6 year old son, it's huge, I could wear it (6 foot tall man).  This may fit him in college. Nice print and thick fabric though!"
"I usually wear a 11 2E (extra wide) in New Balance shoes (including the Aravon Line).  I wanted to try this as a comfortable walking shoe with a Mary Jane look so that I could maybe get away with wearing them with dresses.  I ordered the Propet Mary Jane in black smooth, 11 4E, since wider tends to be better in shoe brands I haven't worn before.  I tried them on and found that my feet slide about inside them.  I can push my feet forward and stick two fingers between my heel and the back of the shoe.  I'm going to try going down a whole size (10) and will return to this review then.  Otherwise, I'm initially pleased with the look of the shoe, the heel height (low), the construction (seems sturdy and well built), and hope that the next size will work out."
"They were good socks to start off with, after a few weeks though they lose their ability to stay up and slide down your leg."
"I love this dress, but for top area to small for me"
"I have the original without the liner and prefer it much more. The lining somehow makes this pullover appear more bulbous. While I agree the lining is soft and adds a thin layer of warmth, I just don't want to look larger than I am. The pullover is definitely oversized like other reviews state so if you can't order at least two sizes down, I would suggest trying to find another pullover. I ordered my usual size small and I have tons of room to layer sweater after sweater."
The large size fit me but needs to provide a bit more coverage in the front. I ordered the large for a reason!
"Not the best, but good for the cost value."
Disappointed purchased @ end January this year but didn't wear till march and the sole is separating from the shoe already.
They are just too big (wide) but not enough to send back. They do help my plantar fascitis so I wear them mostly around the house and yard. I could not do a ton of walking in them because they flop off easily.
"Obviously not as dense as a real chain,
But I needed a replacement in the meantime for my husband until I can buy the real thing again. Still looks great though"
"Great product.  Perfect size.  However, the post is way too long.  It always settles to the front of my ear so it's very obvious that it's too long.  Otherwise, great product!"
this onsie was wayyyyyy too large! way way to big be carefull when ordering. they were very understanding and worked with us but still a pain when trying to giev as gift!
"It is OK.  It is not quite as soft as I had hoped and it runs quite large.  If you are a 16W/18W, you may prefer to get the smaller size.  The arm holes are large enough that it will require a tank underneath, unless you don't mind the side of your bra showing.  The tie in back can be used to gather the fabric and make it fit better.  However, it only gathers the fabric in back, which makes the tunic hang oddly.  It does not have pockets.  I think it will be nicer in cooler months when I can wear a sweater over it to cover the back."
"Runs small. The clasp is not real, it's for decoration and always falls off. My husband received this for xmas and it already needs to go into seiko."
"Fits great, and flattering. My only dislike is the cups in the breast area. They look funny but if I take them out I'll have no support."
Arms very narrow & tight.  Returned the sweater.
Cool looking hat. Little snug but this is due to various hairstyles.
Nothing special.  You get what you pay for...and these were not pricey!
A bit too large to fit in inside pocket of purse while holding readers.  Otherwise fine.
"I'm 5'1"" and weigh about 120 and these were small on me, length-wise."
"very tiny, bandana size"
Bought for 6-8 year olds. Barely fit my 2 year old.
These are very narrow as well as small in general -- they kinda pinch the sides of my face. They're also so short that it's hard to get them to cover my eyes completely. Otherwise they're okay.
I returned it because it was more of a lemony yellow and not a maize color. However I would recommend this brand.
"I bought this Reeboks model as a replacement to my older version (same model) but it seems to be a little narrower than my old one. I'm hoping that shoe will ""stretch"" to a more comfortable fit through continued usage. Other than the narrow fit, it gives good arch support and is reasonably comfortable. ."
My two year old hated these. We tried several times and he wanted to like them but he said they hurt his feet. Too bad because they are adorable. My Older daughter has the slim fit version and I can see how the straps on those are much more comfortable.
I received the dress today and it came packaged well and did not smell or anything. The dress is thicker than most so called bodycons on Amazon which was nice. But the machine stitch work was not the greatest. I ordered a small and the dress fit perfect with room to spare but as soon as I turned to the side the seam came undone in the middle even though the dress was not tight on me. It's as if the stitch was too loose. The dress was pretty enough and fit nice enough that I'll just keep it and will get the seam fixed.
"It's the first Dansko clogs I've had that are too big. They're also wider than expected. I have small feet, and these shoes look like Minnie Mouse shoes on me. When checking to verify the size, I saw ""Made in China"" written inside. I'm very disappointed."
"Didn't fit as comfortably as I would have liked, so I returned them.  Hoped they would be comfortable like they were in the 90's when I owned a pair, but not to be.  I would recommend as they are great shoes.  I'm a tough fit with wide feet and no arch.  Give them a try!"
"better up-size on this, couldn't even put my foot all the way in and I wear this size in all my other shoes"
"Cute, I'm a size 16 now (argh) and they still fit. The material is thin and snags easily, and has begun to fray along the ankle elastics, so I knocked off a couple of stars. I love these though, and I will wear them until they completely fall apart."
fit not so good.
"Very dark, great for sunny days"
it is cute but it turned my neices finger green....so i guess i would not recommend it to anyone else for purchase
"These run narrow so if you have wider feet, it will feel snug. They look cuter in the picture. We haven't had snow yet so I can't say much about warmth."
"It's really baggy towards the bottom, not so cute when on"
"Fits well, decent quality. I recommend this company!"
"Very cute, but a little too small."
"I loved this bra, but unfortunately it does not come in my cup size! I typically wear a 32G or 32H, and the cups on this one run small so a 32H is definitely needed. I don't understand why a company like  Chantelle does not offer more of its bras in large cup sizes. More and more women these days are learning to fit bras properly and realizing that they have been wearing too large a band size, and hence too small a cup size, for years. When I learned how to measure band size properly I went from wearing a 34DD to a 32H. The fit is much better, but now I can't wear some nice bras like this one!"
"Really nice shoe/slipper but uncomfortably large at the heel area. It slides off like a flip flop unless I wear padded socks, which tend to be a little too hot most days. I suppose this would be solved by buying a half size smaller, but these only come in whole sizes."
Nine West shoes as well as boots run small. So I passed them to my daughter. They need to offer wide width.
"This band is a great value, and looks as good in person as in the photos.  It looks like a heavy quality band.  (It's really quite lightweight, but nice none the less.)  But it has a few flaws.  The first is that it's nearly impossible to adjust.  It has the J-shaped hooks that you push down-and-out to release.  They were in way too tight.  I wound up using penetrating oil and tearing one link apart.  It was so much work and effort that I should have spent another $20 for a band using pins instead.

The other problem is that while it looks micro-adjustable, it isn't really.  I think the deployment clasp - which is nice - is generic.  The links are too thick for the micro-adjust to be used more than a position in.  And very hard to move anyhow because the links are precisely the width of the clasp, so they don't fit without a lot of effort, which is hard when putting the pin in.

But if you can get it adjusted to your liking, it's a nice looking band for a great price.

Update: Because it's a low-cost bracelet, the metal links are folded, not solid.  I have hair on my wrists; this band grabs and plucks that hair.  Not as bad as a Twist-o-Flex band, but much worse than the more expensive bands of solid links."
It was smaller than I expected. We had to buy a larger band but the watch was nice.
The pads are very small and move around to much. The bra its elf is very comfortable but does not offer much support.
"Fit's as expected?  That's pretty funny.
Kinda cheap, keep it in the golf bag for tipping the caddies.
Works well for that."
Problem with LED lite. It does not turn off. Drains the battery then LED lite does not work any longer.
The color of this petticoat was a little darker than I had expected.  The size was satisfactory as I had other petticoats from this manufacturer in the same size.
"Fantastic design, tinted as shown but quite small and not adjustable."
"I wear a size 4 and I bought size S, but the fit was a bit too large.  I am keeping them because they are nice to lounge around in.  They wash nicely and come out wrinkle free, just watch the sizing."
"I did not get what was advertised. At all. With that said, what I did get was cute enough and it fit just right. I'm not sure I would recommend this product because I was looking for something with more flow. It's definitely not a kimono, more like a beach cover thing. It doesn't come with a belt, either. But it's still cute and I wore it all summer and am planning on wearing it this summer."
These run big. I am very disappointed. I ordered a size 10 which is what I wear but I should have ordered a size 91/2.
"I really don't like American Apparel after recently hearing about all the lawsuits against them so I won't be buying from  them again. However as far as this top goes as a product, it's as shown and comfy."
"I'm on my third pair of Danner 452 GTX boots because of their excellent fit for my EEE feet.  Because of the great price, I ordered these particular boots from Amazon's Warehouse Deals -- but didn't know the ST designation stands for Steel Toe.  When I tried them on, the steel toe cap added enough so that the boots were way too narrow.  Anyone with wide feet should think twice about ordering this product in their actual size -- perhaps a half size larger would be better.  Returning the boots to Amazon was no problem at all."
"I bought the black coat. It is nice and warm. Looks nice. Yes, it fits larger than what I expected (maybe buy 1 size down).  I can wear a thick sweater under it and it is still roomy.  Frustrated that the occasional feather pokes through the coat. I've only worn the coat twice and have collected down feathers from those two wearings... makes me worried that the coat will lose its nice puffy/fluffy character and wonder if it won't last long.  But... for the price, maybe it doesn't have to?"
The quality is good. Heavy cotton. color is good. I only wish I had bough a larger size.
"I've had my Tingleys for a couple months now and like them quite a bit. They go on and off over my shoes easily, fit as expected, and have kept my shoes clean and dry in both rain and snow. The only reason I gave these 3 stars is because the traction isn't great, especially in slush/snow. I know they're not meant to replace winter boots, but you WILL slip and slide around if you use these in any kind of wintry precipitation."
"Very pretty dress! My only complaint is that it is small. I can still wear it, but it looks more snug on me than in the picture. I am 5'2"" / 132lbs... Length is above the knee and tight fitting up top. Overall, I am happy with it!"
"I wear a 7.5 or 8 in street shoes so ordered a large.  My toes hung over the end of the shoe, and my heel slipped in and out when I walked.  The shoes were warm and comfortable.  I wish they had fit better."
They don't stay put. They should sell these with a backing in order to keep them in place. Otherwise they are nice earring.
"I feel like other reviews have already given all the necessary information and I don't want to repeat them.
I just want to warn potential buyers about the size of this suitcase.
The suitcase itself seemed to be the right size, but its wheels stick out a couple of inches. Unfortunately, I didn't check the dimensions of the suitcase before buying it against airline requirements.
Its wheels make the suitcase too long to be allowed as carry on.
Many airlines do not enforce these standards, but United air and some others do. They won't let it as a carry on.
I have had very hard times because of it, up to being unable to pick it up from the luggage area, paying serious fees and etc.

I find this suitcase pretty useless now and will probably donate it, since it's too large for carry on, but is too small for luggage.
Overall, it is convenient to use and of a pretty good quality. Although it got scratched pretty easily."
Pretty nice. Nothing to write home about
The popcorn texture looks as if it should be worn by grandma.
"The pic shows a white purse and I ordered white but when I recieved the purse it was a light yellowish white kinda color. It doesn't look exactly like the pic but it's a ok purse. It's not shaped exactly like it is in the pic, it's more square. It's a big purse so I'm happy about that. It's not exactly what I wanted but I will stick with it. The inside isn't the color the pic shows, it's gray instead but overall a ok purse and I will keep it."
"Returning them, sadly, because they are not large enough.  I WILL be replacing them as soon as the next size up becomes avaialble."
nicely constructed should have padding on the shoulder strap
"Color is good, shawl is not as good as pictured.  Material used is light weight and I doubt it will hold up after a few wearings and washings."
"great look but not super comfortable, ""okay"" comfort. Great for the price."
Not for speeds above 35mph they allows way to much wind to hit your eyes. They are very comfortable how ever when just riding in town.
"Nice dress but it came in later than expected and it was too small. The costumer service was great, really helpful trying to make sure i was satisfied."
"There's a metal pin and clip in the middle so one side never gets what I'd call thin, but it's a big improvement. If you shake it upside down the cards fall out so be careful how you carry it. Having my cash out for everyone to see worries me more than I thought it would."
"These fit too small for my husband.  I bought the 2XL for my husband who is 6'4"" 270 lbs and they were tight and the legs were short."
"shoes fit well, but they really need more cushion. my job requires me to be on my feet for twelve hours at a time. these shoes became very uncomfortable after just five hours. perhaps they should be made with memory foam insoles. when I put insoles in the shoes there was no room for my big feet."
"I like the looks, feel and colors, but I've already noticed one pair of socks showing significant wear after only 4-5 washes.  They were inexpensive, so I can't complain too much.  I just thought they'd last a little longer than what it appears they will..."
"I liked these boots because they are comfortable, and unlike my other lace up boots, have a zipper. I have a narrow calf and these boots work for me, yet they are also easy to get on or off. I debated getting a size larger but then decided the heel would gap, even with thick socks.  I  may need to stretch the instep area, but maybe  the leather will stretch as I break the boots in. I have only worn them in the house so far.
I only gave three stars because the leather was not dyed evenly. I decided against sending the boots back and will just try to polish the part by the heel that is not dyed well.  It is not that obvious. The boots also had a very strong smell. - stronger than any other new leather products I have ever bought. I had them airing by a window for 3 days till the smell was down to a tolerable level.
All in all they are OK for an inexpensive boot,"
"The product itself looks great but I'm 5'9''-5'10"" the bodice fit well but the straps were way too short for a tall person like me, and even adjusted fit awkwardly. I do have wide shoulders though, so I guess I'm not surprised. I wanted it to fit, but it just didn't work out for me."
Print is high quality. Not a lot of stretch.
"The dress is beautiful and we'll made, but not for me. The size description is wrong. I ordered 1x-2x, but it was like size 14."
"A bit big and the chain looks cheap. I think this would work better on a man. It wasn't delicate enough for me.
It's not bad just not great. I guess for the price it was good."
"It's basically stretchy lace, the strings are a bit too long, the g-string is a throw away, the stalkings were cheap. All that being said it looks good on and I can easily replace the bits I don't like."
"The jacket fits well and looks great on our 2 year old son, but both the shirt and the pants are way too big on him."
"Hard to wear these shoes for  more than 2-3 hours, not flexible enough, lot of pressure on the toes unfortunately...nice looking though"
"Standard T-shirt
Not a cheep thin one, but ...
Nothing special and ...
NOT beefy"
They are not kid sized. Good for adult women's feet.
Didn't really like these. I'm kinda picky about socks tho. Just feel a little loose and sloppy.
"The earrings are nice, well made and a very nice size.  The only thing I didn't like about them is the color.  I was hoping for a more mellow yellow, and these are a very bright yellow."
SUPER CHEAP FABRIC. Not impressed. won't buy again or recommend.
"Over  all, a very nice appearance, but the longevity is in question.  Bought this for my daughter, and 2 stones have already fallen out.  She only wears her Pandora bracelet when she's at work, or going out with friends.  It's not like she wears it to the gym, or extreme sports...  Time will tell, but after only 5 weeks, I don't see a long future for this bead.  Would probably be okay for someone who wears their bracelet occasionally.  It is a nice looking piece, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Next time, I will get something like this from Jared so it has a warranty.  I think the extra cost for a similar piece from Pandora would be worth the cost to get the piece of mind."
"I really wanted to like these pants as I wanted to wear as a costume.  Unfortunately, the back pockets are just too long and awkward so I'm returning item.  These would probably fit great on someone with a elongated mom butt."
"Thin Fabric but Cute Spin on ""Ancient"" costume"
I bought this as a gift for someone and it was too small on her. She's normally a size 18 so I bought her an XXL. It fits her but it's quite tight. It stretches a decent amount but the XXL looks and feels more like a L or M/L
"Normally I wear women's size 10 in Nike so that it what I  order.  In this style I need a 9 maybe 9.5 which is the size I wear in puma, reebok and saucony"
"love this brand. Please pay attention to the dimensions on this one. I did not. I may use this for travel, but my laptop does not fit this (not thick enough). It is well made as are all Victorinox products - I own a couple of their pieces of luggage and a laptop case."
Much too narrow; must return.
"This was my first experiment with the brand, and after reading many reviews it seemed the clothes are undersized or are sized just right.  So I took a gamble and ordered a 2X shirt.  (I normally wear XL.)  It fits a bit big, which is actually fine by me.  However, the left sleeve is noticeably shorter than the right sleeve.

For the price I don't completely regret buying a few different brand items - shirts and pants.  But the sizes and general fitment, combined with the exposed seams and shoddy sewing have me throwing in the towel.  Carhartt stuff is more expensive, but you truly do get what you pay for.  I give three stars on this one because it's hard to be overly disappointed when only spending $20.  But overall, I don't see myself buying more - at least without trying items on first, which of course defeats the purpose of having Prime."
"I ordered this at the same time as ordering a black wig from the same seller, and they both came before when they were supposed to, which was a wonderful surprise. The name says ""white"", but it is definitely blond- which is what I expected, so that was fine. The price is VERY LOW, and the quality is pretty good. It's a bit shiny (I'm going to soak it in fabric softener), and obviously needs styling. I will also probably be thinning it out a little, as it looks weird on my head. Overall, it's a fine wig and the price is great, so I would buy it again."
Nice quality but not the right fit for me.
"I love Asics and have worn this brand exclusively for years. I exercise and work on my feet all day so I wear mostly sneakers and make sure to rotate them regularly. With a lot of my recent Asics pairs, I'm starting to think that factory quality is going down hill. I've gotten blisters and rashes from the inner lining wearing out quickly. It cuts into my feet, especially when I go jogging. I've started using Ktape to cover the holes up but who knows how long that will last. Rest of the shoe is holding up well."
I normally fit the size I ordered and I couldn't even get it hooked in the back.
"Very small looks nothing like the photo, notice how full it is in the photo, how she was able to wear it multiple ways...  I gave it 3 stars because the quality is good no loose strings ..the fur is really soft the one I was sent can only be used as a scarf.. it's the size of a typical scarf...I'm 5ft 127.. pay close attention to the measurements"
"I like these shorts and ordered the same pair in another color and they fit fine, but these ones felt like they were kid's sized. Very inconsistent with sizing apparently."
"It is a little snug in the toe box. Otherwise, it is great."
Not real brilliant. It's just ok.
"Nice, but not many rings fit into the slot. They are average."
"Nice shoes but just a bit bigger than expected. Instead of size 7, a size 6 1/2 would of been better, although, the low cut shoe cut into my ankles."
"The overall fit was good, but it could be longer for someone over 6 foot. Once washed, it shrunk in length 4"" ...don't put it in the dryer."
"Something about them is just off with the sizing. My correct size was way too small, so I returned them and ordered a size bigger, and they are just shaped wrong. I tried wearing them, but ended up giving to charity."
Would have been a great product if not for the awful smell coming from the black rubber pieces. Don't care for recycled rubber materials because of the odor problems they have now. I actually purchased these to keep my car seat covers strapped down.
"I bought the navy blue color, cotton quality is not the best but I have been wearing it, not sure how long it will last, I'll let you know."
"Cool colors, just a little tight. I wear I size 8 shoe, so I was surprised that they were tight."
Really cute colors and design but very narrow and somewhat small.
"First of all I want to point out that the boots I got did not have Vibram soles as advertised. The soles are marked ""Thorogood"" brand. I returned mine, but mainly because of a manufacturing defect: the footbed on the right side boot was uneven - high on the outside of the middle of the foot, which was immediately painful. Imagine having the arch support on the wrong side of the footbed. That's what it felt like. I assume that is a factory mistake. Aside from the defect and the lack of true Vibram sole the boots seem to be of good materials and construction. As to sizing, I wear size 13 to 14 depending on brand, and these seemed a bit snug for a 13. That is, they did not seem to be sized very large like a lot of reviewers have said.

They look well made, the leather is nice looking and has a nice feel. The eye-hooks seem a little lightweight and could be a weak link. The included removable footbed is nice quality, and that's a plus. The heel and  toe areas are reinforced and stiff. I found that the heels slipped even though the toes were snug, but that might fix with a break-in period, or maybe with a size up. Probably the 8"" boots would be less prone to heel slip. Even with the problems I mentioned I might try these again because they seem to be good boots for the price. But someone please fix the false advertising about the Vibram soles. As of February 2012 they are not Vibram."
Paying for the name and that's all.
"I wanted to give these a really good review because they are a nice looking man's slipper and my boyfriend found them to be very comfortable, but ... After only a few months of very light usage, the top part of the seam ripped open. Could just be a random defect, but still, that sucks, especially since we're past 30 days so no returns."
Broke after getting
A little tight and small but nice looking watch for the price.
"These pants had potential for greatness. But the size 6 was way too tight and the size 8 was super baggy. Disappointing for me, but would probably be great for someone with a little different shape."
It's too big!
"I say decent only because I didn't measure the shoes, I guessed at the sizing. Typically I'm a 14, and these are 15. But some shoes fit a size smaller or larger, you know?  These apparently are quite true to size, especially with the extra wide factor. If I'd gotten a size smaller I'd be wearing them now, I've always loved Asics and still do, just this pair doesn't work and it's too late to send them back. But reputable company and otherwise great product."
"The costume is great, you can't look at this thing and not laugh. It's really hard to see out of. The socks are really thick and will keep you warm. The feet don't work right. Don't even both with them, or they will rip."
"I have a large head, this hat fits well.

It is pretty warm when the side flaps are down, that is nice. The materials and workmanship seem high quality.

Cons:

1. It is not water repellent. The faux fur will really soak up water, and the entire outer portion is somewhat absorbent fabric.

2. When you close the clasp below your chin, it is not tight at all. In fact, the flaps go quite a ways below my chin.

3. When you close the clasp above your head, with the side flaps folded up, the hat does not stay attached very well. It is liable to fall off."
"The boot is very cute, just as pictured. It ran a little large, but it stayed on and didn't fall off. I used the Stride Rite measuring tool from their website. For the price of the boot, I was disappointed that the fabric and stitching starting to pile and come out within the first couple of weeks. It didn't effect the functioning, but they looked trashed way too soon. I expected them to last longer and have more quality materials for the price. Next time, I will buy a pair of boots from Target, cheaper, but similar quality."
The shirt that arrived was not the one I expected. The shirt was of just Abby Caddabby. Still so cute and perfect for the little girl.
The boots are cute again but they run small and fit very tight. I need at least one size bigger to fit.
"The ""lived in"" look is a little more pronounced than expected, I had bought the cranberry color last year and it doesn't have this problem.. the black one has little white balls/piles all over"
"Ordered the standard size since it was supposed to fit waist 28-38, but that's not realistic.  Using this belt over a blouse and jeans, I measure 36 inches.  The standard size belt is way too tight for this measurement, because the belt's elastic material is very strong and doesn't stretch easily.  I will return and get the larger size.  I would suggest if you need a measurement 34 inches or larger, get the larger size.  Keep in mind, my postage for the return is nearly $4 (third party seller), which makes this belt on the expensive side for elastic."
"It came pretty fast on Amazon prime. While the fabric of the coat and lining both are good, the stitches leave alot to be desired. Unfortunately, they we're once done and then undone and that left holes on the front of the hood, on the bottom of the front pannel and around the bottom of the sleeves. With this quality of craftsmanship it should not cost that much. I hope my kid will get a good wear out of it before it falls apart."
The socks fit well but the material is a thin polyester/spandex blend and I was expecting more of a cotton feeling sock. They wear well but for exercise I like a thicker cotton sock.  If you are looking for a thin ankle sock and you don't mind a polyester/spandex blend you will like these.
"I like the look. They feel cheap, but the upper material is real leather and looks pretty good. I could live with that. I really like the style and wanted these to work so bad but the fit is off...in a very weird way.

First, the toe box is very narrow. It's ok at first, but I think after wearing the for a few hours it would hurt. For the price, if that was the only issue, I'd probably keep them. The calf fits fine, but the ankle area is really, really large - so when I walk, my feet slide around a lot every step. The boot kind of scrunches up weird there too because of all the extra material. It's uncomfortable, probably painful, and definitely unflattering. They're just a bit too tall as well. I'm 5'6"" and the top of the boot hits me right in the knee, which is awkward and uncomfortable. The boots are pull-on, not adjustable (no zipper, the ties are just decorative), so no matter what, the silhouette of the boot gives you those lovely instant ""kankles.""

Add the odd fit mixed with the fact that the inside is lined with PU leather - and I'd expect to prepare for major blisters developing throughout the day, even with heavy socks I think. Jeans might work ok if you can stuff them in without a zipper, but that wouldn't solve the super huge ankle area problem. Really bummed because I do really like the style. But I can't walk in them even for a few steps, so I have to return them."
"where do i even start? the positives. the flannel is very soft material, color is pretty, and the stitching is amazing. there is not a raw seam anywhere! i love the top. it's huge because i'm very petite and i bought a large because i want to sleep not wear it on a catwalk.

the negative... the rise is insane. as i said, i'm petite, 90 pounds, and the waistband barely came over my hips. i spent two hours carefully ripping the seams of the double sewn in elastic, yuck, to discover there is only 22 inches of fabric from side to side at the top! in what universe is that a large? the back rise is 16 inches. it's 4 inches higher than the front rise of barely 12 inches. whoever designed this thing made it for a mannequin and i'm barely past being one. if it won't fit an anorexic under 32 inch hips person then who will it fit?

i now have a lovely comfy pajama top for twenty dollars and tax... and some lavender flannel for my fabric stash i had not intended on buying. it might make a pillow slip or patch some old jeans.

"I was hoping this would work for my first grader for school.  Unfortunately, it won't.  A 3-ring binder will barely fit, and once you zip it up with a binder inside, the water bottle pockets are almost useless.  Just too small for our needs.  Otherwise, appears to be a very durable backpack and love the sternum strap on Dakine backpacks."
"Although I measured carefully, other reviewers said the dress ran small. They were right. It was cute, but I had to return it."
"The product is OK -the material is cool. It doesn't do much for your figure, however like I said be aware that if you have thick shoulders and arm it can be a bit uncomfortable. Also the bottom tends to roll up a bit after wear."
Cute but definitely order a size up!
can't move toes
The quality is not as I expected from the brand. But for the price that I paid it is good enough. The shipment is awful. It took more than a month!
"I usually wear a large in a shirt, but with this being stretchy material, I was afraid it would be too tight. The reviews were mixed, so I  wasn't sure what size to order. I ended up purchasing the black in XL and it fit like XXL. I should have gotten a medium or large. It will be too much hassle to send back so I'll probably gift it to someone in my dance class."
Cute! I should have listened about the size. I figured since my feet were so small the 5 would fit but they need to be stretched.
The graphic on it doesn't hold up well to the washer machine let alone the dryer. Get's all kinds of comments though.
It is way to short to be considered a poncho top.  I will be returning.  It is a cute top though.
"well i got it on time, but ehhh. most of the tools weren't needed for me. i wasted about $10 from what i actually needed. then again its worth the money. i had one watch resized and the guy told me it was $10, i asked if he sold a kit like this one he said no. he knows that its better for the customer to just buy one of their own. if you have money watches and you find uses for all these tools, get it. if all u need to do is resize a watch bracelet that has pins, then just buy the hammer, pin pusher, and the thing to place the bracelet."
The ring is large but It might be my fault for not measuring correctly...I just ended up bending it to fit my figure and it works! ..it does have a tint of black to it..but Its not very noticeable anymore
"It mine just be me, my calf is on the bigger size, so it's tighter. Love it in all!"
"Son loved these for comfort and aesthetics, but the became tattered pretty quick. First to go was the seem between the toe and the mesh - like completely apart. Other seams frayed/tore to some degree but the shoe did stay together. He didn't want to replace them. Seems with NB there are their standard high quality shoes and some other models that are pretty shoddy. My other son ordered a different model and it shoes little wear, even with him dragging fee ton his scooter."
"These are the exact same leg wraps from the iheartraves.com website, except that I was able to order them with free 2 day shipping via amazon.com. The 2-day shipping was a major convenience because I needed the leg wraps ASAP before I left for EDC in Las Vegas and had procrastinated until the last minute to get them. They were better than the leg wraps that do not have the non-slip grippy top band. My complaint is that the remaining dangling parts that wrap around the leg still would slide around with walking and dancing and have to be redone pretty frequently because they did not have non-slip grips like the main top band. Aside from having to constantly readjust them throughout the night, they added a nice detail to my outfit. I just had to remember to adjust them before taking any pictures."
Complains of it being itchy...
I read the reviews and ordered a size up. I cant keep it on. Dont order big!
"What beautiful boot. Unfortunately, the UPS driver never delivered them. I filled out two 'redelivery' forms and nothing. No call, no knock, no truck. No explanation where they went. I can only dream about them."
"This bag really has no structure, it's kind of a tall floppy one pocket wonder, it's cute though!"
"Let me be the first to say that the fabric quality of this item was amazing. Very soft and stretchy. However, I ordered a large expecting it to fit since I am usually a medium and most reviews said to order a size up. Once I received the skirt and tried it on I could barely get it up to my waist, even with the stretchy material. It was skin tight and you could see pretty much every line (if you know what I mean).  I don't usually go through the hassle of returning items because it's an extra trip I had to make to the post office but there was no way I could ever wear this skirt so I returned it. Got my refund promptly and decided to leave a review for others who may experience the same thing. I'd recommend ordering at least 2 sizes larger"
"I have a pretty normal size 11 and the sandal is
a relatively tight to fit for my foot.  It seems well made
and will probably hold up fine but it is almost too snug.
HBS"
"Fit was right for me, and they don't creep up, they creep down, on me.  but I'll keep them."
"It fit great until I washed it.  It shrinks up in length and I only hang dry my clothing.  I no longer wear it, but it was perfect before I washed it."
"This is more of an nightgown type than an actual dress. The material is stretchy and thin, but not see through. I did however wear it to a party with a cardigan and it worked out well. If you want something to wear that is light this a good dress. The color and style were true to picture!"
"The ""royal blue"" is absolutely purple, not blue at all.
This makes me sad - I should have just gone with the green, but the blue they showed was more of a cobalt, which I love.

Definitely did not expect purple."
This is a fine shoe. It is perfectly made and good looking. I wear a 39 or 8 1/2. I have another older pair of discontinued felt Haflingers that are too small at 39 so I thought I'd better get the 40 to wear with thick socks in winter. I was wrong. They are really big on me. I wanted to return them for 39 but that size was sold out. So get your true size. I will try again when they restock.
"The product is ok, but size is enormous! I bought this leggings for my 10 year old daughter, but they are too big for her...instead, they fit me! I'm not a big person, but definitely not the size of a 10 year old!"
I really do like these glasses but they are not the quality that Spy makes...makes me assume they may be knockoffs. I can expect that for the price I paid so not going to complain too much. They fit really well and love that they wrap around.
Its was very very cute. But a little flimsy. It's definitely not made to last very long. Runs a bit small. The biggest size is 4t max. But very adorable. The bones looked awesome in the dark.
Turns my finger green & I  DON'T wear my jewelry into the shower or when I wash my hands.
These are okay.  Get them if you're in love with the print.  If you are a LuLaRoe lover you will quickly realize these will not be a replacement.  They are shorter than LLR TC and not as much spandex.
"Ordered 6-9M old size, and they are kinda snug first time worn (on a 5 1/2 month old... Just getting snug in 3-6M). It seems Gerber brand runs a little small... She's baggy in the same size from Carter's. They're also pretty thin. I'm glad I didn't pay much or them."
"It's okay, but too thin. Good for summer if you want to wear the black color."
These did the job. A little bit garish.
To small for my wrist. it fits but it is tight.
I wanted to love them but my wide ass hobbit feet kept snapping them and I tried all 3 loose methods to no avail. I really wanted to love them but I guess I'm doomed to walk to Mordor without my favorite sneakers.
Didn't like the leather; was bulky to handle and wear....way too much fabric on the inside.  was not comfortable. I did return it.
"The width was good but the length was just a little short. My toes went all the way to the end of the shoe.
Returned them for fear they would not stretch out enough to be comfortable."
"the watch is fine, there are a lot of instructions to get the watch to work, and when you have to change batteries you have to start over from the beginning, which is more complicated that starting out when it is new."
"I like the workmanship of the slacks, however, this size is somewhat larger than I expected.  The rise is too high.  I will keep the 1 pair as I have already worn it, however, will exchange for a smaller size.  All in all, they run large."
Es un poco ms oscuro de lo que muestra la foto. Y muy fino.
It was bigger than I expected.
husband says frumpy
"I have a pretty short torso and I still felt that this was too short for me. It was very good quality and the beading was adorable but, again, I felt it was too short. Went straight to the donation pile."
This will fit most large sizes. I am a US size 16and it looks nice. I purchased the navy one too as I haven't had much luck with the China made outfits.other dresses I bought were way too short and no good at the bust line....no point in returning the dress because it costs more than the dress so they go to the thrift shop. This boho dress is long down to the ankle and ties at the neckline.cheaply made but this will work for one or two wears then I will wash in cold water by hand and drip dry..so the rest do not fall apart....other dresses from this country I now read all the reviews and trust there write up before purchasing.
Not sure if I will ever wear these.
Fabric isn't as thick as I would like but I have purchased worse
Flimsy but I wasn't expecting much for a childrens Halloween costume.  It did the job.
It's well made but shorter than expected (stops just below my buttocks).  I definitely need to wear leggings with it.  The color was true to the picture.
"This is my first disappointment with a Trotters shoe. I bought my regular length and width and unfortunately , this fit as if we're a whole size longer and a WW. I had to purchase 6 heel grips to buff up heels and sides for a comfortable fit."
"Bright color, easy to put on and off, but on the small size and narrow.  Purchased size L to fit a Youth size 7-8 foot. They just fit."
"i had this bad boy in my wish list for several weeks the (dark grey one)and finally jumped on it..but switched up the color according to the season..(obviously) to the lighter grill grey, but never the less i still received the dark grey one...thanks for not allowing me to change my mind..=) don't get me wrong great product super comfy, but its not what i wanted..but imma keep it and hope for the best on the next purchase. get it together people!(amazon)"
"This is a really pretty mask, but when I was ready to wear it to my party I noticed the stone and one of the decorative strands came unglued.  This was as we were walking out the door to the party, so it was a problem. Tried to glue quickly, didn't have time to spare, didn't look good, ended up just removing the stone and the strand and I double anyone noticed.  The rest of the mask looked very pretty and I liked it better than the other ones I tried on.  I had to rearrange a few feathers that were placed in front of the right eye, easy enough, and the nose piece bothered me a bit but that could just be me."
Cute but not so much good quality.
"I ordered a size up based on reviews, but don't feel it was necessary. it's quite large. material is on the thin side, but overall I'm happy with the shirt. it works with my lifestyle but would not for anyone who needs a more hardy shirt"
"The under wears didn't all fit the same. Some were a little snug than others, just saying:("
Its a little cheaply made but it is made for one night I guess
"This came in a dark grey and bright blue rather then softer tones as I expected, the cuff of the sleeve is sewing inside out and fairly tight on my wrist. Overall a comfortable material and fit well just not the quality I anticipated"
Cute cheap but good for what you paid. Strings are plastic
Crotchet back is itchy
"bought for my just turned 6 year old. she's in the 90% in height w average weight and it was just right as size 4-6. MAYBE a little small, but i don't think so. problems; the shoulder ripped open almost instantly and NONE of the velcro works. (holds back shut and tail on). Pins fixed both of those issues. shoulder was easy fix with a basic sewing kit (5 minutes). she loved it and looks close to the pic. no shoes and the tail isn't NEARLY that long. its only about 12"" long."
"This sneaker/walking shoe fits great! My only issue is, and its a huge issue is  after only 3 weeks and maybe 30 miles on the soles of the shoe is  the treads by the pad of the foot are wearing down! :( I never had a pair of sneakers wear down so fast! )"
"not my favorite, I was looking for something other than a straightener to curl my hair, and my hairstylist recommended trying hair rollers. Being that I love Babyliss hair tools, it was my first stop. I really debated getting rollers, but decided to take the plunge because of my stylist. I used them once, to do my hair for a friends wedding. Maybe I need to do more research on how to properly use rollers, but my hair did not hold the curls, even with hair spray. I was a little disappointed, and worst, my hair was not the best in those wedding pictures! Wish I would have bought a curling iron instead, since I know how to use it."
It was a nice vintage look. I didn't like the material so much but it was okay.
"They appear to be seconds to me, they have a few snags and pinholes in them.  Somewhat disappointed in this purchase but they are just ok."
"I took off 2 stars because the socks turned out to be very much brighter than shown here, almost neon brighter. But I still like them okay."
"This pr. of Jean's is cut generously thru-out. For me, I've got plenty of room. So, if your on the border between 2 sizes, go w/ the smaller size. Lot's of room in the waist & a BOATLOAD of room in the leg! WAY TOO MUCH ROOM IN THE LEG--me & 2 or 3 other people could fit in the legs! When it said ""straight leg"", I thought--Ok, great, nice narrow leg. Not those skinny leg jeans but, a nice close fitting straight leg. HA! Not even close! There is a HUGE AMT OF FABRIC @ THE ANKLE! It's as much as a boot cut w/o the flair.  Also, the weight is puny. It's not a summer weight or a winter weight but, you'd be too cold in the fall & the color's off for Spring. I FINALLY accepted them out of SHEER DESPERATION! This was the 5th pr of jean's from Amazon I had tried. They're good for just sitting around the house or doing yard work but, remember to change if you have go out--even a quick run to the store."
It's a nice dress all in all. The material is a little this and the fit is a tad on the loose side if you are small framed. My biggest problem is that the neckline on the front is folded over but that hides a raw edge that doesn't seem to like to stay folded over. It's pretty but I won't be ordering the other shades like I thought. I don't like paying for items that I have to do finishing edges on something I bought for $20.
"This looked and felt solid, extremely durable. I think they are something between running and hiking shoes. I did not like them a running shoes for training and running a marathon on snow and ice (Antarctica). Felt somewhat boxy, rigid. Plus, the shoe laces are awkward and they do not have the option of pulling laces through holes closer to your feet (useful for better fitting 1/2 size larger shoes). I tested them for 1-2 miles and decided to return them and go with the trail version of my regular running shoes (Brooks)."
"I ordered a half size up.  They fit, but the arch hit my foot awkwardly.  Not sure if it was just that particular pair or if it is standard."
"This is a lovely dress, but the waist is very high in it.  I am tall with a long torso and this dress style won't work with that.  I returned it.  For shorter people this dress would be much better, I think."
"Love this one but again clasp has turned black within a two days, looking for a sterling silver replacement clasp."
Nice material but the colors were not what I expected. They were much more grey and dull than I had thought they would be. Still pretty so I kept it.
Can't complain for 6.00
A lil disappointed  the color is nice  but not the material
Pro: fit okay. Cons: i bought large but the length wise its longer so when i sit down with it it will makes wiggly form. Although i pull it all the right below my breast area. I am exchanging this to medium hope it works. If medium is too small for me the. I will refund this item. Unfortunately the medium size is out of stock so i am returning this item.
This one doesn't even look like It is made in leather? It is More like kid shoes. Not worth it for anyone beyond Tweens.
They are very comfortable BUT my daughter thought that they were a bit heavy.
Style appears somewhat cheap.  The shoe is comfortable.  Returned because I found some other shoes that I liked better and felt were more comfortable.
"The fabric and pattern on the dress is so pretty, but I would have to agree with a lot of the reviews and say that it does not fit as expected.  The waste of the dress is really low but because I really like the dress and the flow I will adjust it myself."
If it's less padding/lift then this bra is for you.  I really do like the comfort of Barely There bras but I need more padding in the lift up bras.  This style lacked that.
Its fine but I got the L-XL and still a little tight on my head.
Shirt is a weird cut. Doesn't sit right on my body. Hangs loose.
The battery was death when i receive it.!!
Cheap Looking ...doubt I will ever wear.  guess I got what i paid for!
If you BF as long as I do..... you need more then this bra... you need several bras do yourself favor and go to Motherhood brand (store not online) and try what you are buying.
Returned them-I'm not a fan of the bumps on the insole.
Not a good quality t shirt just good for a weekend and make a statement: ACDC RULES
These were too small for what I needed.  I have an 18 month old.  These are more for infants.
"This pic is better than the real product,the smell of ""mask"" is Strong! But we just hung it up on a pants hanger and left it out to air it out.
I thought the mane would be nice,but its not well made. But it is a great price for a good costume. Enjoy!"
inside of the sleeves are itchy
The neck is so wide and the waist snug.  Not really how I like to wear a shirt
The neck is super tight and there is no tag so I guess front is back and back is front lol
This is so adorable but I was disappointed in the top. Edges are not reinforced and so the seams turn outward around the neck and arms.
"The length is fine, but for my slim feet, there's too much of a gap between the top of my foot and the leather. I glued a padded shoe liner to the insole to make them fit. I find this to be a problem with 80% of the sandals I try on, no matter the brand."
It is poorly constructed and started falling apart immediately.  I was using it as a home care nurse and so was having a lot of equipment that I was hauling around.  The majority of the breakdown was around the zippered compartments
"Ok first if all they run just a bit small. But run very long in length..im 5'6"" and im stepping on them. Also they are like those pajama jeans you see advertised...very soft and comfy. Extra large is the largest size...but...its really a large...in reality."
"The fit is awesome, and it looks great. I would give this 5 stars and this would be my favorite sweater but the piece I received has a hole which is ever widening.

I am basically trashing the current one so I can buy another."
"The fit was good in length and width, but the sleeves seemed a bit on the short side.  Because of this, my son wore this once."
"Ordered this in my usual size, but when I tried it on it was a little too clingy and I did not like the ""bar"" that went across the back of the neck.  It was very bothersome,  Out of all this, there was something I liked about the top.  It was long (tunic) and I loved the color."
"I was not a fan of the unfinished edges of the lace with this dress, and there is NO LINING in the bodice. It's pretty, but from a distance."
I usually wear a 10 but sometimes 10 1/2. I tried on several pair in a store and size 10 was fine. I ordered a 10 1/2 to be on the safe side and they were WAY too small. I thought they might be 9 1/2 but label and box said 10 1/2.
"Stiff soles, make sure you wear some insoles for arch support. Besides that the shoe is ridiculously cute, you will receive tons of compliments."
"My son's waist is small to be sure, but he is athletic and his quads are large. These are pretty uncomfortable for him."
"Tried some on at the mall, then ordered these in patent leather look.  Arrived quickly and although they are pretty, they are not the same level of comfort as the ones I tried on.  Going to wear them in the living room on carpet a few days to see if they will work out."
The fabric is a little heavier than expected. The fit was more snug than expected. Overall the dress is okay and I will keep.
"These are very cute boots for the money.  I wear a size 7 1/2 and ordered that size because most said ""fits as expected""  Well they were too tight.  I do have a very high instep/arch, so I returned them and ordered an 8.  Still too tight across the arch.  I returned them.  I didn't reorder an 8 1/2 because I could tell they would be too long, as the 7 1/2 were just long enough.  I think for the money, they are a nice little inexpensive boot if you have flat fee or low arches.  I do not have wide feet nor am I a heavy person. Although my calves are big, but they actually fit OK there too."
"This underwear comes simply packaged in clear plastic with the garment folded so that it is very small upon arrival. The material is lightweight, extremely soft, with quite a bit of stretch. The waist bank is 1  wide with the CALVIN KLEN logo on the front in a soft gray. The fit is more like a boxer brief with an extended leg. They do not have a fly and for some men that is important. They hold their shape and color after washing with no problems. They look good on and feel great next to your skin. They fit and wear well under work pants and jeans.  Wonderful material, great fit with long wearing comfort and no laundry issues. At the current price of over fifteen bucks for a single pair of Made in Egypt underwear. .  . they exceed the level of CRAZY EXPENSIVE."
"These are beautiful heels, but they are too high for a conservative workplace or interview, and the pointed toe was too narrow for my feet, so I had to return. I tried another pair on in-store a size up and they were too loose around the heel. Oh well, these are beautiful if they fit your foot shape."
"Loose in the waist and tummy but because it was an add-on, am keeping them."
"I was looking for a cheap alternative to overpriced, name-brand military-style watches. I thought this Rothco might fit the bill but unfortunately I got what I paid for: a watch worth $19, and not a penny more.

The case is base metal, not stainless steel, the caseback is snap-on. The strap is so-so in quality. The hands are highly polished and don't match well with the bead-blasted case. Lume is virtually nonexistent. To me, though, the biggest let-down is the sloppiness of the movement. The minute hand will wiggle back and forth over the span of a full minute, even more when the crown is pulled out. That level of sloppiness is a dealbreaker for me, and for anyone interested in using their watch to tell accurate time.

I'm returning this watch and planning on spending a little more money to get a much nicer watch."
the band on the bra has no stretch in it and creates serious back fat rolls
"Dressy gold low heels that would complete any ensemble.  So, yes, I am not Cinderella, and the the shoe did not fit!
Sad, because they are good looking shoes.  I usually wear 7.5 - 8 M, so decided to order the shoes in an 8 M based on other posters opinions.
Not the case for me, though. They were too snug across the top of my foot and did not feel I could wear for several hours...
Definitely not for wide feet.  :("
These were just okay but I felt like they will stretch out very quickly.  For the price it just wasn't worth it to keep it.
Not super see through
"I bought these last year for a Halloween costume. I didn't end up using them since I went with a different costume. But I did keeping them since they were cute. I'm usually a size 6.5 in shoes but when it comes to heels since I add gel insoles to my heels for comfort, I get a size 7. And I'm glad I did. Always read the comments before purchasing an item. It's a 50/50 chance that you'll buy it and if you're still not sure, then don't get it. But in this case, I'm glad I did. They're comfy, and fit great even with my insoles in."
"I love Clarks brand and I own a lot of different styles of Clarks shoes. These shoes fit well and are comfortable, but they look a little bulky and heavy on my feet."
Gorgeous boots but sizing is WAY off! I wear a 9.5 so I ordered a 9.5... ended up selling them to a friend who wears an 8-8.5. Very slim calf as well.
"loved them at first, I recommend adding pull loops on back to put them on. After a few weeks the soles are all chewed up. Won't grip like it did when new. Not worth the $$"
They are nothing like the 515 bootcut I purchased at Fred Meyer.
Wife Likes it.  Taking it with us on vacation and we got about 10 sets of night ware so the color is good too.
The arms are pretty tight.
"The material catches on everything, which is a shame because it would be lovely to wear otherwise."
Better if fuller
"Iron it, put it on.  10 minutes later it already has major wrinkles in it.  Material is on the heavy side.  Almost as thick as jeans. Snug fitting skirt."
The price was ridiculous for the quality. It was quite small and the waist line was awkward. Bummed to have to return it. :(
tight on my head and slides back very easily.
"The pendant was not as expected.  The handle was not straight properly and the background was a cheap light plastic layer.  I expected a better quality.  However, it was worth the prize if put in a better detail and fasten into the pendant.

I look forward to shope with Bling Jewelry again in the future.  Thanks for a quick respond and your service."
"The color (black iridium, polarized) is almost indistinguishable from stock Oakley color.  The lenses are crystal clear, and a perfect fit for my discontinued Monster Dogs.  The polarization is great, things really pop.  The problem lies with some distortion.  It's not like looking through the bottom of a glass bottle or anything, but after wearing them at work, outdoors, for around 8 hours, I developed a headache about halfway through the day - right behind the middle of my eyes, like when you force yourself to look cross-eyed and get that weird feeling between the eyes, but amplified.  Next day with my new Oakley Fuel Cells, no such problem.  Tried the old Monster Dog's again (with these replacement lenses) and could feel the headache starting again after about an hour this time, though to be fair - maybe because I was expecting it...
Trips to the mini-mart? Fine.  Mowing the lawn? Great.  For anything longer I need to stick with some OEM.
Overall, I would recommend them to those not wanting to throw out their favorite discontinued frames, but be prepared to shell out for a new ""real"" pair."
the kilt is too short and the vendor doesn't have a contact so I could have them make one longer I need it 2 inches longer  the material is very nice and I like the feel of it my only con is that it is an inch or two too short I am 6'6 and you only have one length
this silver was too shiny?? but it arrived on time and was very pretty.
Not a huge fan I really like the quality for price but i didn't not find them too comfortable.
"I'm really disappointed in these boots. With the Sorel name, the price and the cold weather rating they had, I expected them to keep my feet warm. They sat for a few weeks before I had an opportunity to test them. I merely shoveled the driveway for 25 minutes. By the end, my toes were freezing and miserable. The heavy felt liner was a selling point for me. They are solid construction and the removal/replacement options are attractive. But in reality, the design seems to push your foot forward. You end up with excess space at your heel, and toes crammed forward. I ordered a size up, 8.5,  from what I normally wear (I run in 7-8, boots in 7.5-8) and they still cramped my toes. I was hoping the felt liner would compress a little and give my feet some breathing room, but several of my friends said that won't happen, and this is a know issue with these boots. (I wish I had spoken to them first.) Because they sat for weeks until it was cold enough to really test them, it's probably too late to return them. I'm keeping them, but wearing only thick wool socks instead of the liner. Not worth the price at all for this purpose."
"This was purchased for my parents. Overall it is a nice piece but it 'felt' a bit flimsy compared to what I had imagined. Of course this is just my perception based on the fact that I was able to easily press the case and it would bend (did not break or stay bent though.) Additionally, this is 24"" so it is a bit smaller than what I was imagining.

The good thing is that there is a TSA approved lock so that's useful. Again, here a bit of documentation would have helped. The package did not arrive with any manual or instructions. That's disappointing - I had to lookup YouTube to get to know how to set this lock."
"Fits great, but picks up every piece of lint imaginable and is not a durable material. I hoped to use these for rock climbing but the first contact with the rock made an abrasion on the material. These leggings are nylon-based. I realized through this experience that I personally prefer polyester-based material."
look poor
"These pants are baggy enough that my daughter could wear her snow pants under them! The waist isn't ridiculously loose, it is just the fit of the jeans, it makes it hard to find a shirt to wear with them, because they look like a balloon!"
"The fit on this dress was as described. I ordered the purple and expected the color to be more vibrant.
The color was dull."
A bit too day-glo but nice trunks
"About three years ago I bought a pair of doc wingtips but they were shoes...I loved them great quality, tough and comforatable.  So I decided to get the fitzroy for winter...I was sadly disappointed.  The leather is cheap feeling, very waxy and too light for leather, nothing feels real on it., the inside liner is nylon, not leather.  The inside is ripping apart on me.  the sole is starting to separate from the shoe, and they smell weird...not like any leather shoe I have owned before...I can't wait for them to fall apart so I can buy a different shoe or better quality...

My only real hope is that somehow I accidentaly bought the vegan leather shoe...but it does not look like it.

It could be worse, but nothing like my first pair."
The suit runs large. I followed the size chart and my son is literally being swallowed by the suit (the suit wears him and not the other way round). The quality of the shirt is not good and it's sizing appears to be a little off compared to the suit.
Based on reviews I purchased a small and it is too tight through the chest area.  Too bad because it is a pretty dress & very feminine!
The color is true to what I see on the website. The quality is nice and is very warm. The only dislike I have are the seams. They are a bit bulky... more rounded than flat.
"This ring is beautifully made, but following the reviews I opted to size up. The ring does not fit true to size as a regular band. This runs a size or two small, which may be because the band is curved. I wear a 7 1/4 and the size 8 was way too snug. I will reorder in a 9 and hopefully that is more comfortable."
"There is just one element of the wallet that caused me to give it 3 stars. The smell! It has an ungodly smell of burning electrical wiring that just won't go away. It is leather but it sure doesn't smell like leather. I'm hoping with airing time it will be usable. Otherwise, this is a well made and very functional wallet. Just what I've been looking for with plenty of card slots. That is why I have not yet returned the wallet. I hope I can use it."
"Nice warm slipper and attractive, but no support offered at all.  Like walking on a 1"" layer of jello.  I ordered my size, but they were way too large and wide, and I knew I would have balance issues when wearing them.  They were returned."
"This is a great looking man's bracelet, the quality is good, but the sizing is a little small. I bought this for my teenage son and there was no room once it was clasped. He wore it for a little while, but had to take it off, because it was too tight and uncomfortable. I would recommend this for those with smaller wrists. It would most likely fit those that wear a bracelet that is under 7.5""."
"I loved the idea of this dress for Valentine's Day, however it was way too big for me.  Majority of the reviews stated the dress ran small, so I ordered up a size.  The top of the dress didn't cover my bust correctly, so I don't think it's made for a larger bust. I'm 5'7, 200 lb, 36D. Return process was fantastic, I actually got my refund added back to my debit card the same day I dropped the dress off at UPS."
Skirt is fine but the shirt is small
"Loved the colors but the size is smaller than expected, not suitable for size D."
"Perfect for under the wrap dresses. Lace gives an interesting & feminine touch while allowing me to bend forward without concern for propriety. Update! After a couple of washes, the elastic on the lace comes apart. Looks like it's covered in hair"
"As expected. True to size, great colors. Slightky thiner metal and loses color after a few months."
"They were pretty , but very very small ....I bought them for a 52 year old ..ended up giving to a 16 year old more child like, and pricey."
"Fits a little weirdly around my waist, almost like the waist is cut too high for me. I'm 5'9 140lbs and I got the M. Still a cute pattern."
"We used these for a mud run.  They were very cute.  However, 3 out of 5 had holes in the toes by the end of the run.  We weren't really planning on using them again so it wasn't a big deal for us."
They make my feet look larger
"They look good, but definitely bigger than wayfarer. The good thing about it is that they are EXTREMELY light though."
"Meh- just okay.

The size was nice ( my piercing is relatively high up) so this didn't hang too low.
The clasp was too noticeable and didn't stay closed very well.

Ended up falling out naturally within three days which is a bit better than I seem to do with the horseshoes."
Costume would have been great if it fit!  Order up a size or 2 I is very short in the torso!
"I'm between a 3 and 4 star review. I asked for this watch for Christmas and I have just opened it and put it on. It IS very pretty, looks exactly like the photos and it works properly. But removing the links has proven to be very difficult so far. I too had to YouTube the proper way and I am glad a tool was provided (great added bonus when buying this watch)but on the opposite end of the tool is a fork like attachment. It makes alloying the correct amount of force to push the links out almost impossible. I hope that I can update this review later when I've figured out how to remove a couple links :)"
"Decent shorts, but the size table's 36 inch is actually nearly 39 inch"
Pretty but looks huge on.
Arrived quickly. Seems tight. Will do fone
If you are tall and busty this will not fit well. The lines are way off.. .
"I love the colors and materials, I know it's a nursing cami but it was too low cut for me. Your breasts are already swollen from nursing and this barely hid my nipple when not feeding and I ordered a size up. Sorry for being so blunt but I wish I would have known."
"Good design, cheap material. It's ok, but not a going out or cocktail dress... I wouldn't buy it again but it's more hassle to return... It's ok for a morning wear in the spring with sandals"
"I ordered these for my daughter. You get what you pay for material wise and they aren't the best construction, but they'll do. My daughter will be a year old in 3 week and I ordered her the 0-6 month size because her feet are on the smaller size and they were STILL huge on her. These shoes run very big. I would say the 0-6 month size is the equivalent of a size 2 or 3 shoe for a baby."
Good necklace for the cost.  Worried about the metal on light colored clothes.
They don't look as nice as in the pics. They are extremely warm. Not good to walk in for long periods of time.
Very disappointed with this skirt !!  The seam down the front is not straight ... It's a shame because I like the fit of this skirt... I've read reviews where others had the same problem... It seems the seller would make an effort to correct this issue !!
Somewhat Small and defective. I asked for a return and the seller is going to send me a New one.
a little too big for my slender daughter
Returned it as it was way larger than I expected.
"Cute and comfy except they looked more high waisted in the photos. Wasn't the case, but oh well."
"So I am loving the rubber shoes lately, I love how comfy they usually are. These shoes are okay. I don't really love them though either. They aren't very comfortable as far as this style of shoe goes. I also don't like that they have a shiny finish rather then a matte finish. My husband told me they look like fake shoes or like Barbie shoes. I love the sole of the shoe, I ordered the green pair so the sole had the cute pineapple design and it is really fun. I like that the sole is pretty thick, you don't feel like you can feel the rocks you step on through it. The heel has a pretty thick piece which is actually quite nice if your standing for a while. I wore these without socks and got blisters walking around for the first few times wearing them. I think these are a fun shoe for the summer but don't expect them to be super comfy. They give me blisters if I don't wear them with socks, and if you wear these with socks your feet slip around in the rubber."
Very cute and will keep for later but they are HUGE!!! It will be months before my 11 month old will even be able to wear the 6-12 month size. The 0-6 have room to spare.... buuut we bought 6-12 and tried a friend's 0-6 after. Cute shoes
Cute.  Purple.  Kylo Ren wore a black uniform
"(USE/PURPOSE) I use flipflops to go to a swimming pool side and also to clean my shower tab. This pair of flipflops fits with feet well; however, it's slippery. I cannot really use this flipflops for walking on a tub while cleaning because I slip and fall with these.
(SIZE) I usually wear 7 because I am a little smaller than 7. But this... is a little smaller 7!"
"I returned these b/c the straps were too big for my foot.  I loved the way they look, but my foot is too skinny"
"The top waistband on these is probably more suited to a taller person.  I'm 5' 0"" and it comes up above my waist.  Other than that, the fabric is soft and wears well."
Stiff..
This was ideal for indoor office days where the aircon is blasting too cold. It is way too lightweight to serve as a real puffer vest in extreme weather conditions.
"I like this swimsuit, but the bottoms are too small for the measurements. The top fits fine, so unless you want to buy the top and bottom separately to get two different sizes, then you have to be aware.
Yes, the sides actually tie, but the material amount is barely enough to cover the front if you pull enough to not cover the back. It's too small for comfort or any decency."
"I wear an 11.5, so that's what i ordered.  When they arrived, I could not even put them on my feet.  I was able to exchange them with no problem, I actually saved $20 dollars as the larger size was cheaper.  Waiting on the new pair to arrive."
"Nice detail, but it seemed to be much larger in the ad,"
"it doesn't compliment my curves, I asked for a large and feels like an XL
ill still wear it tho."
"I wore these for about 3-4 hours and I was disappointed that they don't feel as comfortable as I had hoped.  I also purchased two more pair in alternate colors.  Unfortunately buying them in the winter months and not wearing them until March, it's too late to return them.  I have problem feet, so it may be more my feet than the shoes.  I think I will stick to buying shoes in person in the future."
They would be good but they shrink. Don't put them in the dryer. I'm 5 foot 8 and now they are high water on me.
But we need a D width.
Large for a 8yr old but it worked by holding it together with some bobby pins. Hair was a bit all over but did the job for what it was purchased for.
I thought the shoes looked cute but my son never got to wear them.  The seemed to run very small.
"Bought for a school play. They worked fine since it was for short term use (40 minutes). The feathers come loose easily so had to glue many back in place in order for the wings to look full. They are simply glued to styrofoam, which looks poor when exposed."
Ordered a size bigger than I normally would due to the measurements on sizing chart. It's still a little tight in the chest.
"Using the sizing chart I chose a 6 hoping they wouldn't be too huge because 6 was supposed to be for a 38-39"" 'waist'? and mine's about 30"". They are absolutely skinnnnnn tight so the next size up would've actually been better. My whole reason for selecting these boy shorts was to have a bikini rise but leg openings that wouldn't rid up like ALL my other bikini underwear does. They ride up.... Dang! I guess the never-ending quest for underwear that stays put back there will continue..."
Regarding the shoe its great. I was under the premonition that I ordered a wide. When it arrived it was the same size at the standard.
I bought a shoe stretcher and it helped.  I'm an 8.5 and bought a 9.  I should have gotten a 9.5 or a 10.
"I ordered this as a gift for my friend. She said, she liked it :)"
"It's cute, but only has the stones on one side."
fits a little loose although same size as all my other bras.  straps are not adjustable enough.
"These shoes are very cute, and since I bought them for a costume, serve that purpose.  They are not, by any means, comfortable.  The back heal is made from a cheap cardboard that was crushed in transit (after having two pair sent due to poor packaging), and the tiny heal makes balance a little difficult.  They are not padded on the inside at all.  Do not purchase these for comfort.  They were less than $30 though, so what else could be expected."
"comfortable, light weight with good padding for my tendonitis"
"Fits a bit small, but still OK.  I need a white skirt for certain events, and this one is affordable and simple.  If I wear it as a dress fits fine, but as a skirt fits a bit small. The white is see through so you will need a slip, so I purchased the ""Underworks Nylon Maxi Length Half Slips with Snip a Length"" from Amazon, which works great with this white skirt."
Thin and make me feel a little sweaty
"My complaint would be I bought the four hook extenders, and they are bigger than my four hook bras.  Not a perfect fit, but I made them work."
I have a small waist and hard to find my size. This pair was a little too slim and tight for my comfort level so i returned and replaced it with the next size up. I am satisfied with the quality but next time will try to find relax fit in my size if they have them.
"Love the dress, fit a little snugged in the bust area."
Super big and shrunk like crazy.  I kinda admit that i like it better after the shrink!
"Definitely on the cheaper end of cummerbunds, but for the under 20 bucks price for all three, not bad for a costume or if you're watching your budget.  Cummerbund seems thinner than a normal one, but the elastic in the back makes sure to fit most sizes up to a woman's XL."
"Good quality & fast shipping but... the size is way off.  My husband is thin 5'9"" and 145# and I ordered L/XL because people said the robe runs small.  This robe sizing is WAY off!  Be careful, even one size up isn't enough to get the size right.  The quality is good though and the shipping was good too.  Just can't trust the size at all."
"This jacket is okay. I knew it wasn't going to keep my very warm, but it's also cheaply made."
Very cute jeans but just not enough support. They were too loose at the waist and felt like they would just fall down. They were very cute and would probably be fine for someone with a bigger tummy than hips. I hold my weight in my hips.
This item does fit to order. My only complaint is that it wrinkles easily.
"The shorts part of the skirt are really short, and I even have thin legs, yet they feel like they keep moving up and I have to keep trying to pull them down. Also it is hard to get a tennis ball in the shorts. Great color though."
"The lace color (navy) is great and I was looking for this thiner width (6mm or 6/25"" is hard to find). The feel of the laces are stiff, a bit crumbly, so its a bit awkward to tie. For that reason it comes undone relatively easily because the knots cannot stay right. Maybe without wax it might perform better"
it was ok..but it broke!...Not sturdy
"I am honestly disappointed. I had ordered a small thinking that I would be able to get at least the first notch in, but I was mistaken. It would latch but I had to suck in and even then the latches seemed like they were going to pop up.

Instead of going through the trouble of returning it, I thought I'd keep it until I'd need it after the size up. When I went back on amazon and went to order it, it said that it would not be in until February 7-24! It's January 11!

Ladies measure your waist before hand and do not assume or guess that you'll get what you're looking for, it will save you a lot of trouble"
"I am disappointed that it does not come in half sizes.  I tried size ""10"", and it was way too big. I exchanged for size ""9"", and it is a bit too short.  I have had ""muck boots"" before, and loved them, so I will put up with the slightly too small size.  Wish the company would consider making them in both whole and half sizes!  They last forever!"
Make sure you order two sizes up.  Then they were perfect.
Nice quality product - however size was way too big.
it was a nice looking product. i gave it this rating cause was ok nothing that would make it stand out on my wrist. i would recommend it as a simple piece of jewelry
My husband wears this ring every day and doesn't take it off. And now after 2 years ... it has lost its shine and he probably needs to buy a new one. For the price that isn't a horrible idea. The size was accurate and he would probably want the same one.
"Loved the boots, but the 7's just too small.  i have other 7 Skechers that fit perfectly :(  Make sure you buy a size bigger than you need."
"Same here, I ordered this for my friend and he rocked it for whatever occasion he needed to use it."
It was a decent quality and pretty warm and comfortable but I didn't have a use for it for the price so I had to return.
"Got hole right away, glad I bought two. A friend had also one at the same time, also got a hole right away, but didn't have a back up pair.
I ended up putting some clear nail polish on it and will use them for practice"
The Prongs catch on everything. They are not smooth at all Hopefully my husband can fix it. pretty ring anyway.
"I literally limp in these.  Not sure what exactly the problem is, but my foot sits funny in them and it hurts like a sprain would hurt in my left foot.  If I change shoes, it goes away.  I've experimented with them on days when my feet feel fine.  I put them on, and my left foot starts to really hurt almost immediately.  So, not working for me at all and I need to give them to GoodWill.

On the bright side, the soles are very grippy, and the arch support is good."
"jacket elbow stitching tore the first time wearing. This was a gift, there is no replacement , out of stock"
"The tights are very good quality, the fit is very big though.  Maybe 6 to 7 inches too long for her."
"I usually buy the Jockey brand tank top, which I can only find at the outlet malls, but decided to give this a try since it was a little less expensive.

The Jockey size I get is 1X and since several people said this ran small, I got the XXL. It fit ok before washing it and I was surprised when it shrunk so much! It's too tight now, but since I'm wearing it under my sweaters as an extra layer, it'll be ok, I guess - as long as I don't gain any more weight <rbg>. The Jockey 100% cotton tanks haven't shrunk like this one has.

The Jockey tank is a ribbed cotton, the Hanes is smooth and a little softer. It has a nice feel. The straps are a bit wider than I'm used to, but I think it'll work ok.

I like the length of the tank - it will tuck in just fine (I'm 5'3""), even though it shrunk.

I'll keep it and use it for now, but won't buy any more of these tops."
"I ordered these in a 7.5 because all of the reviews said to go up a size or two.  I normally wear a 6.5 or 7, depending on the shoe.  I ordered a 7.5 because the idea of ordering an 8 just seemed to scary.  That was a mistake.  They are too small and if I work in them for more than a couple of hours my toes get really sore on the ends.  Definitely get a full size larger than your normal size.  If you're in between sizes, round up to your larger size and then go up one size.

Quality:  They're cute and seem pretty sturdy, but they look kinda cheap close up around the stitching.  I bought them for work boots, so I don't really care."
"I ordered these to go with my son's batman costume.  They are cute and decent quality (wish the same could be said for the costume...), but they're enormous!"
"Love Easy Spirit, but this style just didn't fit me as well as other styles."
"The color is much darker than the photo and has a greenish, greyish tone to it. I don't mind the color, but I bought this for hiking and was hoping to have a brighter color so that I could be easily spotted in case I need help. The darker blue with the greenish, greyish tone makes me blend right in with the wilderness.

It's thicker than I hoped, but that would make sense with the tight weave that is necessary for true sun protection. It's fairly breathable. I was in the heat, but not overheated while wearing it. The heavier weight was not ideal for me and that was the uncomfortable part."
"For the price, I expected better. This set is pretty, but I would expect to pay less than half of the price charged here for comparable quality at a department store. The earrings are small, but they look nice on. The necklace is small and the chain is very thin. The necklace clasp is a little tricky to fasten because it is quite small.

The ring is the most substantial piece. It can not be sized, so you have to hope that it will fit one of your fingers. It is just a little tight on my ring finger, but somewhat loose on my pinky.

This is nice costume jewelry, but if you have a budget of ~$100, you can do better."
Lens are darker than picture
"Just a bit too light and transparent, but nice fit."
"I bought this for halloween. Its okay considering the price, but like most costumes this price range they are good for maybe once only."
"Not as wide as a wide width should be, but could be flexible over time."
Good but oversized
"not comfortable, very stiff, but kinda warm"
A little too big making the fit a little uncomfortable
This is the second pair I  have purchased.  The first pair fit perfectly and the second pair (same size) is somewhat smaller.  A little uncomfortable.
"I like the vest.  But once I got the royal blue colored one and tried on, it looked too much like a Walmart vest to me.  I have bought others like this with prints that I much prefer."
way too big!
"There is really nothing special about these socks, but they fit and are comfortable."
I was pleased for the first couple months.  Comfortable bras are my friends.  But then it began to lose its ability to lift and shape.  Apparently all good things must end =(
"Thinner fabric than expected given my past experience with this Calvin K briefs (bought 4+ years ago)  I ordered a large given reviews, but I think they are true to size, so should have ordered a medium (did not shrink).I will look for an alternative that doesn't feel as cheap."
"I will be returning these boots. Have bought them before for myself and my daughter and they were wonderful. But this time around, the insoles that were jammed in are the wrong size! So now they'll go back. Ugh."
My curves. Where did they go. It's so weird. This does not complement an hour glass figure. Its more for the thin non curvy type of person.
"I returned the pair, they're cut very generously all over.
The 18W waist felt loose even though that's the size I take in jeans and this style is not for ""apple"" shapes!
Too loose around the waist and granted they're labeled relaxed fit but they felt way too large.
The material and color were great however, nice weight to it and very dark black."
These are NOT 100% waterproof.
Cheap and good for one use.
"It looks larger little bit than XL in about 1-2 inches which make it looks bigger than my accentual size.
but the color is exactly in picture and all are same ."
After 3 days the insole on both shoes came out. Glued them back in. OK for the price.
"I have another pair of Clarks boots that I LOVE, so I ordered these, in the same size, but the fit was a no go.  Too tight across the arch of the foot, and my heel felt like it was sliding a bit.  They were cute tho.  I returned them."
Sizes are smaller than stated.
"The color is lowly and size is perfect, but it is too see through. and the neckline is too low. Sending it back."
Great product but thay didn't fit
It's not for lightweights. This purse is absolutely beautiful but it's heavy even when empty.
"I sent these back because they were to narrow.  But the quality and design seemed really nice - was disappointed about the fit, because they looked so nice."
I like the shoe but I wanted something more like a bootie.
"good fit, thicker than I wanted"
"These jackets run large. The XL is a little big but I can wear it over sweatshirts, so it will work."
Great shoe and I love it but... it squeaks!!! Loudly!! The left shoe every time I take a step!
"This sandals booties are cute, but way too hot to wear especially in Florida. The material (not true leather) is too hot. Other than that, they look very cute and color is a perfect neutral tan-beige, it looks exactly like the picture!"
Return it was to big but honestly very nice! For the price
Nice shirts for the price but they run very small.  If you would like your child to be able to wear this for a while then I suggest you order up a size or two.
"I bought the Black/White/Matte Gold and the synthetic leather makes the shoe look somewhat cheap.  I have to admit the shoe is comfortable with the cloudfoam insole and fit true to size but I recommend you buy a half-size larger if you have a wider foot. Secondly, this is not a fashion sneaker for an adult male with expensive taste.  It will work for a teenager into extreme sports but for older male individuals look into buying a pair of Frye's or Cole Haan for a more mature look.  Lastly, the shoe laces were rather long for some odd reason,"
"Cute, but one of the prongs was off to the side of the ""diamond"" instead of on the corner. Needed to use pliers to move it to where it belongs, but it still looks kinda off."
Weird shaped foot bed.  I returned them.
"Bought this watch as a low cost watch to wear to work but with all of the movement of my wrist, the watch band unhooks and falls off. Might be ok for someone that doesn't have a lot of wrist movement."
"I knew I should have paid closer attention to the reviews before I got the size I did.  Instead I followed the size-guide and when the product arrived (which was FAST, the very next day).  I went ahead and tried it on, or rather, tried to try it on, but realized almost immediately I should have followed the suggestions of earlier review to order 1 or 2 sizes up!  Unfortunately, since I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review, exchanging the product was out of the question.  I went ahead and tried it on the next morning, it was definitely a struggle, but with some persistence and a continued tug/pull on the fabric, I go it on.  The produce definitely does do what it says it will do!  It sucks you in and your figure is instantly slimmer and smooth.  For this reason alone, I would recommend it, but DEFINITELY order up if you don't want to have to fight getting it on.  I have to imagine that it will loosen up with wear - (another benefit, it will help your posture!  There is no wiggle room when sitting, again, it may loosen up with some wearing.)"
Its nice but the cross is cheap
"its pretty tight, but I can still wear it. In the crotch it is missing about an inch of material. I don't know why. But I bought two of them and they both have a square hole in the crotch."
"I ordered a pair in black and they do not look like the picture that was up at the time I ordered them. I see they have changed it since then.  When I ordered these, the photo was of a solid black pair of skinny pants/jeggings. What I got is not solid black, more like a dark gray denim. They have gold seams like a pair of jeans, which is not what I was going for with these. Worst of all, they have rhinestones on the button and other details. Aside from that, they fit well and are very comfortable. I am keeping them just because of how comfortable they are.  I think they will be fine if I wear them with a longer shirt to cover the rhinestones, which I tend to do anyway with tight pants.  It is irritating that they advertised one thing and then sent something else, but if you are looking for jeans with rhinestone details, then these are actually pretty comfortable and flattering."
These are terribly uncomfortable. I like to wear these on days I won't be walking around much. They are very cute and go well with all types of outfits
"I got these for my father in-law. We accidentally got two pairs, so he got to compare both pairs. Interestingly, the first pair fit too narrow, but the second pair was fine. I guess they were made in different factories, and that's why there was a slight variation even though they are the exact same size. Anyway, we returned the one that was too narrow, and kept the other pair. He said they look very nice and they are fine for relatively short walking, but they are not comfortable enough for long walks."
"this sneaker feels great on the court but you will lose a shoe every so often if you don't tighten after a few games, mabe its the socks don't know yet over all i like them so far thanks."
"I love the fit and the feel of the material but the seams need some work. They are not sewn peroperly and I feel like I bought knockoffs. Dockers has work to do in the QC depart,ment."
Ait pricey for quality and size.
Cute costume. A little cheaply made but still nice for the money
The glasses didn't come with the cleaning fabric. I purchased the same model and brand before and it always come with the fabric.
Purchased these for my husband. Arch support is just okay. He says they are comfortable.
"The corset is actually very good quality. I'm an US size 2-4(European 34-36) and I got the extra small, of which I'm happy - because it fits just right. The cups could be bigger though and with some kind of support (will need to have a bra underneath so stuff don't fall out..) and the small blue things on the corset to put on your arms - I had to cut them off - they were too small, you'd have to have very skinny arms to use them. The cape and skirt - whell, both could definitely be longer and better quality - which is why I'm only giving 3 stars. For that price, the skirt should be longer (and I'm short, I'm 5, 2) and the cape -it would winn a lot by being a real, long cape for effect. This looks like I've put a childs cape on by mistake. All in all, I'm happy with the purchase, but I think it needs too much work for the price..."
Not a trim fitting as I hade hoped.  I took in the shoulder and sleeves for y 3-year old grandson.  He will wear it for Halloween.
"Didn't wear them long enough to break them in before I returned them so they may have become more comfortable with wear. They were too wide at the forefoot (relative to other EE widths that I wear), and chaffed where they narrowed at the arch. Light weight compared to other steel toe options. Well made. The problem with the eyelets others mention may be due to the rather skinny laces."
"They are exactly what I have been searching for, except unfortunately, 1 shoe fits differently than the other & hurts my toes."
Material wasn't as soft as had hoped it would be and it was a bit tighter than expected. Ok for the price but wouldn't recommend.
"Let me start of by saying this is a nice bag, lots of compartments which is what I was looking for. BUT i found it to be a bit heavy before I put anything in it, also the inside line was a bit excessive. I will be returning it."
"They are really nice, good quality. I wish they were more true to size."
"Not for girls with long torso, im 5'9 200lbs  it was too short for me"
"Wasn't quite the quality I had expected. Doesn't really have that ""crisp"" look as in the pic. More a bit sloppy and material just not as expected."
"I wanted to love these shoes because the leather is excellent quality. However, they run small and the normal size 8 I wear was much too small. I recommend sizing up if you buy this shoe."
Fits well.  Only flaw is the seam on the panties is right where the crotch is... hate it when panties do that- definitely designed by a man.  They give you major camel toe even if you have them pulled way down.  And they are semi loose on me.
"My 2.5 year old is tiny. He weighs a whopping 25 lbs due to chemo and we have a very hard time finding underwear that don't sag in the waist or legs for him. These fit perfectly.
That being said, if you have a heavier child these probably will be on the small size post wash and dry.
Also- Ryder isn't Featured as a main character and my son was a little bummed with that."
"I loved the shoe. Very classy looking and comfortable. Received many compliments the day I wore them. Unfortunately, the ankle starp broke the same day that I wore them, so now I have to see about getting them fixed."
There is something wrong with the pants
"Super cute, but very big!  I ordered them in 0-6 months, the socks that came with were size 2-4 years."
"I did my research on the size so I'm happy with that.  I also didn't mind that the hem was just cut off, it looks nice!  I thought I would like the shorts, as opposed to just a suit with a skirt bottom but I didn't care for the shorts.  I have large thighs so they kept hiking up, uncomfortable, might as well have just been a regular suit, would have been more comfortable.  Lastly, it's called a ""shaping body"" style suit...not so much.  I love wearing the snug fitting shaping suits but this was definitely not one of those so again, not as comfortable in the suit.  The suit is pretty as far as the style and material, just not my type of suit but the price was excellent so I'll keep it as an alternative to wear on longer trips."
I am a size 16..The coat is too small for me..so one size does not fit ALL..I had to give it to my daughter which is a size 5 and it fit her perfectly so if your not a slender woman..This is not the coat for you...
"I miss the style of bra Olga made that is now discontinued.  The straps were stretchy and never slipped off the shoulder, the underwire never poked the tender skin under my arms, and I didn't feel as if I couldn't wait to take it off. This bra doesn't live up to that high standard.  I'll likely leave the Olga brand behind, if they're going to become like all the other bra makers in the world.  I'm not convinced this is really an Olga."
"It works, but they need to offer a longer bag for longer trains or a lacey bottom or princess type gown ."
"Purchased 8 (2 each in 4 colors) loved the colors, not the material it is stiff and somewhat heavy, (FYI: I believe the reviews vary because all models of the Haines Adult Long Sleeve Tees are lumped into these reviews-but they are not the same, the version I purchased had a very small Neck, others say they are ""comfort tees "" and have a lower cut, larger neck. It would be helpful if reviewers named both the model & the seller in the title on these "" Includes all "" reviews since Amazon does not separate or has a filter that includes model type and seller. I read many reviews that the complaint is on the seller not the product.) Size is terrible. Let me say I believe size depends on the country where it is made. Haines Ts come from 3 countries that I know of. These were from Hati. Spouse wears a med. made in China. I ordered the large, I tried it on and it was to small for me and the neck was to tight, so returned. while waiting for the return I ordered a single shirt in a 2X, before reordering the eight in the larger size. When it arrived I immediately washed it with the thought it would shrink to a 1X, it did shrink somewhat, again tried it on, again the neck was to tight, the body fit but was snug and the arms were to long for me, that's when I gave up, once again knowing there was no way my hubby could wear one of these shirts, so I did not reorder- instead bought similar shirts by Fruit of the Loom at a local store so hubby could return and get a proper fit if needed. The only good thing about the transaction was the seller-no problem with return and refund. Did not return the one I washed because I had asked and knew it would not be returnable if I washed it."
"Very small and flimsy, I am a size 8 and it was small."
"Difficult to iron (for me).  I had expected denim. I will look for ""easy care"" in  the future. No recommendation."
"Front is... strange. But the back is very pretty. Im on the fence about this shirt, I purchased an XS and the sleeves are a bit large, which may be affecting how the rest of the shirt fits."
simple according to their price but the small child sizes
The sweatshirt looked red in the item picture but it is actually pink.
"This is really nice for my headband ,I never had something like it before but I think it's a little thin and fragile ( it could've more sturdy in my opinion ) Thad why I just give 3 stars"
I don't like the lok
I like this wrap although it is not as full as I would like but the fabric is comfortable.  Great for summer as it is light
I didn't have the change to wear it but is the same at the picture
These run small. I got a 9.5 and had to return for a 10 and those were almost too small.
I will now give up on buying footwear online. These are not comfortable and too small unlike the previous pair I had. They received three stars because the brand itself is a good brand
This is a product that you were a couple times and throw away. You can't wash the skirt of fall apart.
"The purse if very, very pretty.  I love the pink pearls.  The first pearl was lost at the hotel as i was getting dressed. The second pearl in the car going to the wedding. The last couple at the wedding and reception.  I hope i can find similar pearls to replace the lost ones.  I guess i should complain, i got what i paid for and had one use and didn't realize this was a ""disposable"" purse."
"These are great looking sandals that are comfortable and fit well. I noticed the reviews about odor but thought that since my child never had foot odor problem even in closed shoes, I would risk it. All was well at the beginning but after about 2-3 months of use the odor developed and is getting more noticeable with time. It transfers onto the feet. Repeated washing and vinegar soak diminished it for for several days but it swiftly returned. Will not buy these again. I'm going back to all leather sandals that never smell and don't need to be washed (will save water too)."
"I gave these a 3 because they are cute, and I'm sure would be great for some people, but they are only good if you have a VERY small nose!!  I was happy about ordering them until I got them.  5/16"" rings are extremely small, which I guess I didn't think about, I just figured with the high ratings that meant it would work for a lot of people, with varying sizes of noses.  (I now am a little self-conscious realizing that I have a big nose, lol.)  I guess I could bend it, so it is larger, but I want it to maintain the shape, so I'll order something different.  I would make sure for anyone considering ordering to measure the distance between your piercing and the bottom of your nostril to see if it would work.  Going to give mine to a friend with a little nose, and sure she'll love them!"
Order way larger than what you may think.  I didn't really like the neckline.  It might be OK with a scarf though.
"These shoes are very cute and the pictures are fairly accurate.  The heel wrap is not perfect and has multiple overlaps causing concern.  The shoes have a 4 inch heel and run true to size.  I expected them to run small like the other monkeys and ordered 1/2 size larger, my mistake."
I bought this to keep my arms warm in the delivery room but couldn't use them because of the IV. I ended up donating it because it's not really something I would wear otherwise. The fit was a little snug.
"Received a 2X, but fits like a 3X. The illustration shown on the page had a gold trim on the end of the sleeve, but came with silver. Too late since the shirts were embroidered & given as gifts."
I just didn't realize they would be so wide.  My fault.  I know I wear a narrow.
"Good shirt but it's not the classic polo the company used to make. The old style would last for years in terms of color fade, seam and fabric. This one will last six months."
"the watch seems a little bit big, but its okay. The product looks very nice and its cool to have"
Pretty sexy and shows lots of boobs.
I ordered the 40 h the band size is okay but the cup is a little small has a lot of coverage which is good going to return it and try a 40 I it seems to have a good support
According to the size chart I should fit in a large. I ordered a large and it is WAY too small. The material is VERY soft and super comfortable! I wish this fit because it seems like a great nursing bra. Will probably return and get a bigger size if this sleepy momma can get out of the house 
I am 5'8 and these pants were just too short. Would have worked ok if longer. I sent them back.
"I was hoping this would form/flatten my stomach from a side view. But really it just tightens the shape I already have. It does do well for my hips though for an hour glass-like shape in that area. It does bunch up on the sides and back.
Size-wise it does fit as the chart says."
"The shoe itself seems like it is made well, and from authentic leather as the description states.  The reason for me giving 3 stars is because the shoe is too big, the description says fits as expected, but I normally wear a 10.5 in shoe and 11 was the only size left.  I figured it wouldn't make a big difference, and I can just wear thicker socks. Not the decade here, I might have to wear 2 pairs of thick socks if I can bare it! Other than the size I think the shoe is great even though I haven't worn it besides to try it on. (I got it for too good of a price to send it back)"
"This was well made, but the fabric wasn't particularly pretty.  A shiner material would be better."
its ok. runs small
"I usually wear a size small shirt, but this definitely runs on the small size.  The ends of the sleeves were a bit too snug on my arms.  Otherwise, great product for the price.  Nice, comfortable material.  Great with leggings."
These shirts look better flat than on someone.  I got two and am not happy with either one because of how they look when you wear them.  he pictures look great and the shirt looks good hanging or flat on a surface but something is lost after the curves of the body are underneath.  Im no fashion expert nor a fashion stickler but the conception  is much better than the reality in my opinion.  I should have sent them back for a refund but I feel its my fault and not the sellers.
"got these for my new Hawg, not too impresed. couldn't find a description for steel toe, or height . took a chance, so i lost.
not steel toe, not very tall. Got some kick ass Docs instead."
kinda cheap looking
"I am fond of the style and the loose ""airy"" fit. The style has a definitive Latino emphasis, as the name suggests. My problem is that the company did not make a larger size and this one was too small. But I strongly recommend this lovely shirt.
Thanks, Steve G."
The color is off
"Bought this for my wife for wedding anniversary. Overall its a nice product but  the size was the issue. It was small and barely fit her wrist. Size options should be made available instead of ""one size""."
"I like these boots, I just wish the pompom strings were shorter, I think they got longer with time and I had to tie them around the boot since a regular tie on one side still had the pompoms dangling too flow. They are entirely decorative so didn't think they needed to make them so long."
"Cute! Great for one season, but it's not super well made. But that being said, I'm so glad I bought it. It was by far the favorite birthday present for her, she loved it!"
"Very smashed n can't see, to fluff it back so disappointed ,"
"Im trying really hard not to laugh here. As soon as I put them on one leg, I knew these were house leggings. They are true to size; I wear a Medium and they fit well. Very cute, soft, comfy and completely see through. Wear some yoga shorts over them, a long shirt or another pair of leggings underneath. If not, be ready for looks and stares. Maybe a nice surprise for your significant other!"
They fit but feels small or tight around the sensitive areas
Super short!  I won't let my daughter wear this as is. I will have to add some fabric or wear with biker shorts.  Shame because the design is really cute but ...really.  This is not what I teach my daughter is appropriate.  I could imagine her walking up the stairs at school or a gust of wind coming it was so short.  Again it is a cute design and will be great but with length adjustments.
Pretty but Runs small
"This polo runs a bit smaller.  I recommend going up a size.  Also, the material is thinner - so an undershirt is required with the white polo."
"Very tight, especially for this brand"
Too wide for me and they're not leather.
These were larger than I expected and would not have stayed up without a garter. But for the price they worked. Shipped fast and were in good shape
"Small in the chest. If you've got those large nursing breasts your nipples may peek through. Very annoying! Also, it's just not the most comfortable or flattering. If you're in the market, I'd look somewhere else."
I really liked the watch but the poor contrast of the time gradually became annoying. One review I read the poster stated that they liked it too but that the illumination needed to be worked on and I would later agree. The light but button is something from he 80s. A little incandescent like light the does not show the time in the dark at all. The manufacturer needs to illuminate the faceplate.
AdorBs!! Sooo many compliments!!  I'd totally buy again 
"Our 2.5 year old isn't quite a size 6 yet, but we could only squeeze her average width feet into the openings after taking off the thin socks she was wearing. (We purchased a size 6). Quality is decent, but not as good as I'd expect from Kamik.  A flap of rubber from the sole stuck up a bit at the toe and heel. There were also a few spots were glue and/or rubber was stuck to the upper part of the slipper. We will return and look for something different..."
"I absolutely love Keens and have multiple pairs in different styles.  These looked very cute so I thought I would try them.  I was a little surprised that the toe bed was small.  I was also hoping for more support through the arch.  They are cute.  However, they are not my go-to shoe for being on my feet all day.  I prefer to wear the Newport H2s or Whispers for all day wear.  The shoe is still cute and looks good with different styles, such as jeans or shorts."
I ordered two. One was bigger than the other. Still pretty.
"Shrinks to about 2/3 original size, I had to return it."
The dress is well made and of a thick quality material. I'm a 38DD and the top of the dress didn't fit at all. If you are smaller on top then it may fit fine. For this reason I have it 3 stars.
To hot
minimal shrinkage and fade after 1st wash.  all good
"Love it, but very tiny."
They ran short - had to return them.
I ordered 2 of these and only one is very pretty. The second one is peeling and bent. So beware...this purchase is hit or miss.
"I really loved the look of these boots, but they were not comfortable. I have several Frye boots and I love them because of their comfort, so I could not keep these as I knew I would not wear them. They dig into the side of my ankle really bad and also didn't have as much cushion in the sole as my other Fryes. They were true to size though and DO run a bit narrow in the toes but I have narrow feet so wasn't a problem."
"Very good quality, packed was excellent, fast delivery but size was somewhat small.
Need to be clarify it in Amazon site, it is slim or tight as shown in the picture.

In genral, I recommend it"
Comfortable but kinda long for being labeled petite.  I'm 5'2 and they were too long for me.
Doesnt fit right . The bra doesnt come with cup inserts is just fabric too. No coverage if its cold out
I had to put better arch supports in the shoes.
Ended up broken...
"I really wanted an amber ring, as did my Dad's wife so she picked this one out since she likes the green color, and it had good reviews. And although it arrived quickly, the setting looks kinda cheap, and it doesn't do the stone justice, I really wanted to love this ring, but now I am embarrased to give it to her since it is her first ring off of Amazon, and I don't want her to be dissappointed.. It also comes in a little felt black bag, and after recieving rings from 2 other sellers on here, I was hoping to get a box or something but I will put this in one of my ring boxes, and hope she overlooks the band.. If you really don't mind the complete costume jewelry look, then like I said, it is a nice stone."
I got this for my daughter and its just too short.
"The outfit is super cute, lightweight enough to work indoors or outdoors with layers underneath, and the rubber on the feet and furry tail are nice touches, but a couple of problems. Our baby is almost 11 months and based on the size chart from the company's website the 6-12 month size should be a perfect fit, but it is huge, especially the headpiece. The other problem is that the mesh lining on the headpiece is sewn over the mouth area of the ""fox"" -- which is visible if you zoom in on the product ad. Even though it is visible on the product ad the amount of overlap on the one we received was quite a bit and it distorts the look of the face. Not sure what we are going to do with this costume..."
I am using them with big shoes or to sleep.  I didn't realize from the picture they were very bulky.
"Picked up a pair of these as an alternative to LLR, they are ok. They may be even just a little softer. Why only gave them two stars is about the pattern. The pattern I ordered looks just like the product photo on one leg, but the other legs is really off. It's kind of a wide, up side down V pattern so on one side I have the center of the points going up the front of my leg and on the other just slanted lines. My leg is currently in an air cast that goes up to my knee. I ordered legging because I'm usually a dress girl in the summers, but I'm currently doing physical therapy 3x a day... so no dresses for me right now. At any rate my point is that with a short dress or tunic and the air cast, only a small bit of my left leg is visible, so having the pattern be so wonky isn't a huge concern right now. However, I won't be wearing them in public after the cast comes off. If you are looking at this brand as an alternative to LLR, here are my thoughts:
1- order a print that looks ok if it's not the same on both sides
2- I wear tall and curvy in LLR and the plus fits just fine. In number size I am around 20.
3- The waist is different. I have very short waist. My LLR tall and curvy come up to between my belly button and my breast, but they have a yoga waist so it just folds down... These come up a little higher in the front, but have an elastic waist. The back dose not come up nearly as high as the front. If my butt was larger these might not cover it so well. At first I thought I put them on backwards, maybe next time I will put them on backwards to see if that helps. Honestly, if the waist was different I'd order every pair that didn't have prints that you would want to match on both sides.
4- Like LLR, the pattern on these don't stretch out of shape.
5 - I love the print I got, if only it matched up.
6- I mentioned this earlier, but they are so so soft. I wore them to a LLR party tonight and everyone thought it was the LLR brand in a print they hadn't seen. Even after touching them."
comfortable but really quite large. wasn't worth sending back. I should've ordered at least one size or even 2 sizes smaller.
"These are very light weight and almost feel cheap, the color looks true to the picture, also the color looks a little cheap also. I am sure I will wear these occasionally, but they will not be my favorites. I am thinking they would look good with another small crystal stud above it."
"Really pretty but the cups are a bit weird. Makes the girls a bit wonky and skewed.
Much like there's a search party going on at my elbows and the ladies are trying to help search too.
A definite ""what the heck"" moment.
I'm giving 3 stars bc the rest of the bra is well made and it's  (again) really pretty."
"It's one to wear for day to day, and matching clothes. Will see how it holds up to everyday use."
"The style of the blouse is very nice, as well as the color is vibrant, but the material is very cheap.  Would not purchase from again."
"Standard value socks.  They seem so fluffy initially, but there's a whole lot more nylon/polyester type webbing than actual wool, and they compress down to about nothing.  I'm not convinced the wool percentage is accurate, as they aren't particularly warm.  Wouldn't wear them outdoors hiking in the winter, but they're sufficient to wear around the house in slippers, or a short trip around town.

Again, I more or less knew what I was buying, so no complaints."
"Its Ok, not quite what I expected"
"The cut feels a bit small (lower off the hip) but otherwise very nice. I've worn and washed several times and they have been fine. To help keep out he wrinkles, hang 'em up after coming out of the dryer!"
All I can stay is that they smell bad. It took three days of being outside to get rid of the smell. I think it is the dye or something but the look great.
"I did not like the bone on the sides.  It really poked into my ribs. loved the fit and the feel of the bra.  Since I have worn it already, I am going to try to remove the bones."
"I got these shoes for a costume for a haunted house. I normally wear a size 9 in all my heels and have normal feet, not wide. I tried these on and could barely get my foot in! The other reviews say they run true to size but if that's the case why are mine so darn tight?

I would exchange them for a size up, however, according to their website and by my estimates, it would cost me almost $30 just to exchange for a different size due to shipping rates and restocking fees when I already paid $48 for what is supposed to be my size.

Because I'm not made of money, I can't afford to exchange them so I guess I'll have to suffer this year with these shoes or just yard sale them and try to find a cheap replacement. :/

As far as everything else goes, it would have been a great purchase had their exchange policy not been so expensive. I'm just not interested in paying so much more in addition to what I've already paid for."
Does not look as nice on and the ties don't have a designated spot so you have to weave them through fabric
These boots were okay. I never saw the measurements so when they arrived I was shocked about how tall they were. The picture showed that they flared out. I assumed that they were shorter. If I didn't know that they were going to be tall on me then I might not have bought them. The color is true to the picture as is the heel. After about 1-2 weeks there seemed to be some fraying around the stitching. This can be fixed easily. I do fold them down however but it can look a little odd. Hopefully I can do something to make them look better on me. These boots are okay quality I don't know how much they will wear down over time.
These run a little small and are pretty thin.
If you wear a large order an extra large.  Other than that...you'll love it.
Not sure about this pair. Fits a little weird and causes my toddlers feet to peel. We have other timberlands which are ok.  Right now I wouldn't buy again.
"a little tight for my taste.  Smelled very chemically out of the bag, but super fast shipping."
My hubs did not like it as the seat was waaaaaayy too big. He has been wearing Russell 3X for years
"The shirt is poplin fabric, I do not really seem to be the perfect material, yet is lightweight and comfortable, if you're not used to using it can generarte any allergies, but resume is a basic shirt to wear with suits and look stylish."
These jeans are comfortable. They seem to fit okay.
"It is pretty. And it is as pictured.  However, RIGHT HANDED buyers should note that it opens differently than most wallets.  So it feels like it is really for LEFT HANDED users.  If you open it as a right handed person would (pull snap up with right hand, and the change pocket to the right) the bill and card section are pointed downward so that everything falls our.  If you are left handed it would probably be great for you.  But if you are a righty you probably want to skip it."
"These boots are so stiff and uncomfortable, ended up giving them to my daughter who has feet of steel and can where anything."
"Quality is OK
the size a bit big"
"I have a red, white & blue hoodie already but really wanted a Stars & Stripes one for the 4th. With all thats
going on in politics lately, I wanted to show my support for and celebrate our Democracy. This was the best
looking in my opinion. I ordered it in a Medium I may have been able to go down to a small. Its got lots
of extra room. I originally thought it might shrink a little in washing, and then still allow me to layer under it.
However, the website says its 80% cotton, 20% Poly the tag says its 60% cotton and 40% poly.
Not much chance of it shrinking with that much polyester. It also will probably pill as all blends like that do.
But. the worst is..Im allergic to synthetic fibers so an accurate description of fibers is not only the law, its
imperative!  The higher the synthetic percentage, the less likely I can get away with wearing it. Im
very disappointed. Had I known it was 60-40 I wouldnt have ordered it. All that said, its a nice hoodie jacket.
Its a medium weightperfect for cool summer days or nights. Its well made and the colors are right on.
bright intense red and dark navy, as is our flag. I subtracted 2 stars. As much as I want this hoodie,
Ill probably be returning it because of the fiber content of the fabric."
To small around the calf needs longer straps
"Material is great, but elastic sort of stretches out leaving a bit of air conditioning.  Still, for the price, its cheap as unit."
"I returned it.  Nice, but not for me."
"The watch is beautiful, but is almost always off. My husband only wears it for special occasions and constantly has to reset the time. Perhaps it charges the more you wear it?"
"Cute and feminine, but I wore these for about two hours yesterday and one sandal got a ""ripple effect"" under the ball of my foot. This is super uncomfortable so I've contacted customer service. Doesn't seem like this should happen for a $50 pair of sandals."
"These shoes are beautiful.  However, they run small and narrow on the front. I would recommend to order a 1/2 size larger.
I also think the picture is deceiving as I had the impression the shoes had black tones but it's all brown/beige.
They are being returned..."
"Quality is okay... won't know how it holds up to the first wash but it looks good thus far. Again, its a shirt"
"nice boots, cute and cozy. fit is sliiiiightly too small, I would've liked to go up a size so I could wear my thick socks with them. but after breaking them in a bit, they're doing better. I like these boots a lot, they get a lot of compliments. I sprayed them with a waterproofing protectant to keep them dry in the snow. reason for 3 stars is because I can tell they're not gonna last me out of this season, but what do you expect for a pair of boots at this price?"
"The socks are great, but the blue on them doesn't match the blue on wonder woman shirts, so they don't look like they all go together."
"Bought these as a TOMS alternative, as they were a fraction of the cost...unfortunately, they didn't really work for me.  The length seemed to run pretty true to size, but they are pretty wide on my narrow foot.  Seem to be well made though, and a decently cushioned insole."
"When I first saw this top I was very excited, but when I ordered it, however, It was unusually small. I'm usually medium when that was too small I ordered LG and even that was so tight, I'm not big its just way tight and show every little bra fat. It's not flattering in the back at all, the front is too tight unless you're skinny than forget everything I wrote. It's a nice fabric and nice color."
Definitely not what I thought it was going to be but still pretty
"Cant really complain about the quality when priced like this. The brown belt is a little stiff. The black belt(brown on the back) appears to be better quality and also has a reversible buckle. Not sure how long they would last..but definitely worth the price. The buckles are a nice dull grey metal and not shiny, which is good.

Edit mar 2013: After a few months of use you can tell t ear and tear. The brown belt has visible scuff marks and the dual sided belt makes a squeaky sound."
"Style and fabric were fine, but these run small, as I have found in other Lee pants."
"Overall I like the pants enough to keep them but I have to agree with other reviews that the cargo pockets are ridiculous and useless. The upper pockets- one on the right; two on the left (dont ask)- are tiny ant good for carrying anything other than loose change. The lower pockets, where I and probably a large number of other people keep their mobile phone, are SO low that anything kept there (like your phone) bounces off your knee. So annoying that I pulled out my phone after 10 sec. for me, sort of defeats one if the main reasons for wearing cargo pants. Other than that I like the fit, feel and look if the pants. They run maybe an inch large in the waist."
"This dress is soooo chic!  However, the size chart should be adjusted as this dress runs small in the bust and waist line.  Otherwise, its a beauty."
"I ordered this costume for my teenager daughter because she wanted to be the mad hatter for Halloween. We ordered a little large so we could layer a tank top and tights/leggings under to make it more age appropriate.

It looks great and she received a ton of compliments."
"The inside of the wallet, with it's very bright turquoise color, looks a little cheap. I really wanted to like this because it has good storage space, but I am returning it because it looks too plastic-y inside. I'd prefer it if it had a more muted color lining."
"I tried to buy this exact pair of shoes at a retail store but the size 10 was too large.  My normal size in just about any shoe is 10.  The store did not have a size 9.5 so I ordered these in 9.5 from Amazon thinking They'd be good since the 10 was just too big.  But the size 9.5 was weird.  The right shoe was quite comfortable but the left shoe was not. The left seemed smaller in the toe area than the right.  Could just be my left foot is bigger? Maybe, but normally I wear size 10.  Sadly, I returned them.  I wish they would have been more comfy and correctly sized in the 10!  They seemed like a very good buy for the price and felt solid and durable."
"Sent them back, didn't feel like they were ""for me""."
"i bought it for using with leggings but im 1.60 and was too large,seems as a dress,have to do something for using it."
"Pros: This ring is beautiful! It sparkles and looks great on my finger. It didn't leave a green mark either after I wore it in the shower/more than a few days. It is sterling silver.

Cons: It's not nearly as blue as it is in the picture, mine is more clear. That was a bit disappointing. The middle gem was also chipped in the corner. You couldn't really tell unless you looked closely, however it made the gem loose in the center. It got to the point where it spun in the prongs. Not suggested for every day wear."
Cute but the apron is a little big compared to the dress. We had to tie the top straps and the regular straps to keep it from falling off.
"Cheap, styrofoam-like material. Very fitted. Good price."
"these fit great, but the color was different in person.  i"
"Strap too tight, had to punch a hole on strap...tacky."
"Nice poncho, but it needs another set of snaps below the ones provided (not just the ones under the arms) so that when the wind blows your legs are not exposed to the rain. Other than that it is fine."
"I ordered this in the color khaki because my laptop screen depicted it as being mostly white. This is actually a beige scarf with no white in it at all. I was looking for a white scarf with red in it so I returned it. It looked somewhat like the color option yellow.
There was a quarter sized hole in the scarf. It was very light weight and sheer. The map design was interesting.
I have since ordered the color option yellow which is a darker beige background than the khaki scarf."
"Flimsy, not what I expected."
"Great bag, love the zipper option, but it broke pretty quickly."
Returned these for a nimbus 18 because I wanted it to be more cushioned for jogging.
"It is a great cut and fits well, but it is completely shear.  Unless you are hoping to show things off, you would have to wear something under this, which to me, just adds bulk and so I'm returning it.  But if you know what you're getting into, it fits nice."
"I love the dress and fabric. It just runs small! I usually wear size medium, size 6, and it felt like an extra small on me, I am 120lbs, 5'3, I'm a 36B, my hips are 32 and I felt like the dress was so tight it felt painted on. Fortunately for me the dress is embellished with tons of sewn on sequence that you can see any ripples that should be there, so I still went for it and wore it to NYE for that's all I had ordered, and didn't have the chance to re-ordered. Everyone thought it looked great on me, but it was honestly too snug to be comfortable in."
Nice watch. But I wouldn't call it Unisex. The watch is too small for a man. Should change the name to women NFL watch.
"It's a nice Jacket , my only gripe is the sleeves , it's tight in the upper arm and it makes the shoulders of the jacket poof up a bit,  the wrist part of the sleeve is bigger than I thought it would be. I wish the maker could reduce the sleeve on the wrist side by an inch and widen the upper arm by an inch  I think I'd be perfect then. I got the XXL because I have a large chest. 38ddd.  I didn't expect for it to close. I had hoped for the arms to fit, the sleeves were too long. But it still is warm and stylish."
"the material was fabulous, but it was too large in the shoulders and arms.  I ordered up a size because of other reviews.  I should've ordered my regular size or 1 size down."
"Ordered the sweater in black and ordered a size up from what i normally wear, perfect fit mi us the fact that the sleeves are somewhat short doesnt completely cover wrist"
"These fit well- the color is a very vibrant pink (much brighter than the picture shows).  My young teen daughter had a pair of the flat ones in a different color, and she liked the idea of a small wedge... but the bright pink might be a bit too much for her (and she LOVES pink)."
Decent swim trunks but I would say the size runs a little on the small side. Waist fits about right but the thigh area feels tight for any type of active activity. They have that snug feeling in the legs like you could rip them when climbing the ladder out of the pool or getting into the bed of a truck. I do like the overall looks and style. Will be trying a size larger and that may take care of any issues I have with them.
Returned.  Too snug.
"For what they are, and the price, then I guess they are worth it.  But don't give them as a gift, or expect them to impress."
Too bright of blue for my husband......and fits alittle large
Wasn't what I was looking for... fit was quite narrow around the shoulders and the look just wasn't as I expected. I ended up giving it to my father in law.
I can not tell a whole lot of difference with these glasses on or off.  Road glare might be reduced a little.  They do look and feel good.
I ordered a large thinking it was big enough but is was a little too small.
"The one negative about these boots is that they are a bit short in the shaft.  And I am only 5'2"", so that will hold true for pretty much everyone.  Other than that, they are comfortable, well made, and stylish."
"Cute shirt but it was cheaply made. We got this as a  ""you're going to be a big sister"" reveal gift for our daughter. It served its purpose. The seams are not even professional done and raw. If you want for regular wear I would not recommend but as a keepsake like we were doing it's great."
"I ordered down one size and I didn't think I would be able to fit it once i pulled it out of the package. Surprisingly, after a few tugs and sucking in my F.U.P.A.(and laughter from my hubby as he watched me struggle!!!) I was able to connect it all the way. It was only comfortable to wear for a couple of hours. The boning started to poke me :("
It is ok but ???
A little too casual for my style. Brought on a trip but dod not wear as feels bulky.
Look cute wish they were brighter yellow.
"It's a very deep blue. I was looking to buy my husband a peacock blur shirt to match a dress, and this is almost a slate blue."
"Really nice, well made but sizing is off.  I ordered an XL 14-16 but size was more a medium or 10."
"Cute fitness. However, it arrived with a stain on the chest area. Currently working to remove it, but disappointed."
"I ordered these to replace the ones I had that were wearing out.
I compared the labels, fabric, size and style.
They are not the same as my other ones. They look nothing like the picture and are fitted in the legs. I will keep them to work out in, but I can't wear them to run errands, etc. Too bad!
The Danskin label has a black line crossingout the name. Maybe that's a clue.."
"The socks are great, but one set already had a hole in it. Possibly from packing?"
Wife loved these for our Hawaii trip!
Shoes pulling apart where sole meets upper cover on outer edge. Had hoped they would last longer.
Fit more like a man's shirt and a little too long
"This is a nice watch, we love Freestyle.  But...once received looked more like it was intended for wear by a woman or teenage boy...in other words, it was much to small (as in dainty) for my husband."
"Way too small, but very pretty"
Cute shoes but very flimsy should cost 10 to 12 dollars. Not worth it for 18
"Super cute, but really hard to walk in.  (and I wear heels all the time)"
I really liked the leggings. The print was exactly what I was looking for but I ordered the larger size and they were too small. I have an apple shaped figure and the waistband was too snug for me. The legs were fine. I usually wear a size 14 pants but the waist has to be big enough to fit my shape and these were too tight in the waist.
"I loved the idea of these leggings more than the reality based on two main complaints:

1) There is a seam going right up the middle of the crotch which is unattractive and embarrassing. This is absolutely a deal breaker.

2) It has a very low rise which barely reaches over the muffin top, and when I bend over or squat (the activities for which I wanted this item to provide coverage) it rolls down on the sides. I'd have to hike the pants up every time I move. Really wish the rise was all the way to my waist."
"Good experience with other Keen sandals led me to giving these a try. It may be an issue of individual anatomy, but I do not find these to be satisfactory. The thong part is thin and slack, allowing your toes to ram into the toe cap. The cap is somewhat elastic and covers only half the width, which allows a toe or two to slip in an out, creating irritation. The tread is good and the foot bed comfortable."
cute top for vegas! but make sure you are aware it's pretty sheer and you can't wear a bra
too big but was ok for the reason i purchased them. I didn't wear them long.
"While comfort isn't exactly what you're looking for with shoes like this, these weren't the most comfortable shoes out there. Perfect for a quick night out or event where sitting is involved."
"I read the reviews on these socks before I purchased, including a comment about some sort of dog/cat fur covering one persons order.  I thought it was odd and possibly a fluke.  My 5-pack arrived on time and nicely packaged....HOWEVER, mine ALSO had some sort of white-colored fur covering all the pairs, as if they had been laying on someone's pet-covered floor.  I thought it was possibly factory-dander or part of the sock material, but it is clearly pet fur.  Quite gross honestly, since these socks were meant as a gift!  I decided NOT to give as a gift and keep them for myself and washed them thoroughly before use (I would have returned, but didn't want the hassle).  They are comfortable and warm and are a very cute pattern.  Really nice quality socks that are well made, just disappointed they came with all that fur."
"I'm 5""6 and the tunic is definitely not as long as shown in pictures. I have to wear a tank underneath as it is a lot shorter than expected. Also has a very big neckline."
"Says it is loose fit and fits like T-shirt. I found the xxl to be clingy and also tight across the shoulders. The sleeve length was great. For less money, buy the Speedo. The shoulder seam is diagonal and under the arm versus an at shoulder top seam on the BG. While I'm sure the body glove may well do better when wet at far as fit, I purchased both as options to wear on a deep sea fishing trip. Will pack both but wear the speedo."
"They fit too big, but luckily my daughter will eventually grow into them."
They are fine for what they are. I am used to wearing non-cotton clothing that wicks moisture better and dries quicker.
Not really large. There aren't any really large duffles I've been able to find on Amazon.
Shoes look great but have a flat sole. Not great for all day wear
its ok not the best for its prices
"I'm not too pleased with the material. It's comfortable enough, but it rolls up and twists around when I'm pulling up the shorts. Handling them when I'm not wearing them is like grabbing a Slinky from one end. They wear like slightly more pliable athletic shorts. I guess I just prefer flannel for lounging around the house, so this isn't really an indictment of this particular product."
"Why would Dickies skimp on the material around the pockets, when it is a double-jean knee?  Pockets roll over slightly and pooch out the white cotton lining. Had to iron the pockets down to keep them in place.  If they had used a touch more material this would not be a problem."
I'm very conflicted on these boots. I bought the whiskey color and they are gorgeous.  These are truly wide calf boots and fit my 17 inch calves beautifully. Even a little room around the top! The heel slides a little but I'm hoping this will adjust as I break them in.  Unfortunately they did arrive a little beat up. A scratch on the right toe and a cut on the left side. They came in a shoe box but that was just in a bag. I don't know if it would have helped if they were shipped in a box instead.
"I found the XL to run small.  Also, the color was more of an oatmeal than an apricot IMO.
Quality of the product is good though: fabric, zipper, seams."
"My product just came in the mail today and I'm not sure what to think.  I don't think it's even comfy cute.  I'm 5' 2"" and usually wear large tops, so I ordered a large and it's really big.  I swim in it.  The length is really long and the sleeves go way past my wrist.  I'll give it some time and see if I like it more later.  Wish I could try a size smaller."
i ended up giving these shoes away. the back comes up too high on the ankle and gave me a blister on my achilles every time i wore them. pretty shoes though
"I have this frame in 3 colors. The last pair I bought in black were obviously much more cheaply made. Don't know if they sell knock offs or what. The best pair in this frame I ever bought through Amazon were Crystal clear frames, not yellow clear, crystal with mirrored lenses. They fell off a boat and I mourn the loss every day for the past 5 years. Wish they'd make them in crystal clear frames again. I would buy 3 back ups. The yellow clear I and other people like a lot. The Havana are nice too. I would pass on the black frames."
"I say this as a typical heavyset American, but the elastic waist on this one-size-fits-all skirt is REALLY small. It seems very stretchy, but if you are a size XL normally, it will start to straight-up hurt after a while."
Too wide for my narrow feet.  Loved the style and heel height though.  Too bad.
Very small.  They barely hang of an adult ear per se.
"The cut/style was good and fit as expected. The material was VERY thin and the edges were not finished nicely, so it would have been more of a night shirt/work around the house shirt if I had kept it."
love this shoe but had to order next size up.
"I was looking for a nice pair of relaxed fit black jeans to wear in the evenings when going out.  The only problem with these is that they are cut like European Blue jeans and have goofy-looking pockets.  They might fit right in at a Bodega, but I am sorry, I prefer a traditional American-cut blue jean, even when it is black.  Won't be buying these again."
"Comfortable shoe, like the style. Can't give it more stars because, like so many Skechers shoes, the soles pick up every pebble! I live in the country and walk a lot. I have to be careful about not wearing these outside or else I'm picking rocks out of the soles before I go inside and either slip on the tile or scratch the wood flooring. Too bad, Skechers."
These shoes were an akward fit for me.  They seemed quite narrow and did not fit like other New Balance shoes I've had in the past.
"THESE R FABULOUS!  I started out with 2 regular Leggins not Capri Style period they fit so amazing. I have just ordered three pairs in Capri and one more regular Leggin now. I have been a trainer for over 25 years and I can honestly say these are very comfortable. For those very athletic women you will know what I'm talking about when I say there is a very comfortable built-in crotch no underwear needed. I am five foot seven 132.5lbs in a regular legginn the large fits perfect....OK I GOT 4 MORE IN THE MAIL TODAY. STILL LIKE THEM, BUT UPSET ABOUT THE BLACK WITH PURPLE STRIPES AT THE BOTTOM.  NOT FOLDOVER??? IF THIS WAS IN THE DESCRIPTION, I MISSED IT. BUT DONT RECALL IT BEING THERE. SO, FYI ON THIS STYLE."
"Like some of the reviews mentioned, the steel toe portion are not wide enough if you get this shoe in 2E after you have warning in and there is no arch support witch will make your feet more fatigue even with different inserts but they do have good traction and life. Hope this helps buys with thire decision"
"Great boot, my daughter loves the color and sparkle. its a bit tight to get on, but once on it fits well. I'm so used to rainboots being easy to get on and off but this one is a snug fit to get on. there is room in the toe, but hard for my 3 year old to get on herself."
"This one has many useful features, but I prefer the layout and look of the Baggallini Everyday Crossbody Bagg.  From now on, I'll stick to that style as long as Baggallini keeps making them!"
OK fit
"I like a tight fit in a wrestling sneaker, but these seemed sensually narrow and tight.  Unfortunately, the only way to find that out is to wear them for a little while and then it's too late to return them."
It's cute and good quality but is super small for my head. I can barely wear it at all and constantly adjusting or holding on to it.
Not very warm
"I like that it's organic and made from a soft, comfortable material. I didn't like that it was too small to contain my breasts or that it didn't hold them even a little bit in place when I laid down to sleep. I used the sizing chart and advice provided in reviews when purchasing, but the sizing just didn't work out for me. Just the thought of ordering another and then possibly having to return that size if it didn't work was exhausting to me since I was caring for a newborn. So I am returning mine. Went to Target and got nursing bras that actually fit and felt comfortable. They aren't organic, they didn't carry those, but fit matters more than an organic source in those initial weeks when breasts feel engorged and you just want a good comfy bra to support you while you nurse your precious newborn."
"I thought the hat would be of a little higher quality.  It will do the job for a party, but I don't think you could wear this hat as you would a regular hat.  It is merely part of a costume."
Nice but not long enough.....fit to close  to my neck
Expected them to be more comfortable.
This is for age 7 or so - my grandson is 4 and it is way too big!  Too bad it doesn't come in toddler sizes (4 or 5 T)
"Used these as wind pants on a recent camping outing.  The trouble is the legs are far too long a,d they can't be shortened because of the zipper at the ankle and lower leg.  I had to roll them up significantly.  I got the extra large and am 6'2"".  The waist is generous but not too much so.  I think the legs are just too long for the garment."
These shoes are very cute but are only functional for fashion. I can't imagine wearing them for lots of walking. They are VERY hard and stiff with little comfort or padding in the soles. They also run a bit narrow.
"Smaller than expected, but love the little pockets and compartments. I don't carry much but it still seemed small. Shoes,  shower shoes, shirt, compression shorts and shorts and it was snug. Think about how much you will fit  before buying. If yiu are carrying a lot, this will be too small. Minimal about of gym stuff, this is good."
Does Carter's make different quality clothes for certain stores? I've found that there's a difference in Carter's baby clothes from store to store and I'm not talking about Carter's and Child of Mine or Just One Year. These bodysuits are thin and not very good quality like normal Carter's. The fabric is thin and too stretchy almost like there's polyester in it which I hate. Do not recommend if you're looking for regular Carter's quality.
"I'm keeping the shirt, but it is not as shown.  It looks like it form fits (somewhat), but that is not the case.  It is very flared, so I intend to alter the style.  Take 6 inches off each side.  I sometimes wear a large and ordered a medium, so use your judgment."
"Why only three stars?  It's an average between the quality of the product and the terribly poor description used to sell it.

5 Stars for quality.  This hat is exceptionally well made and comfortable.  The materials are top quality and I expect to use it for years to come - under certain circumstances in the summers.

1 Star for poor descriptions and advertising photos.  This hat is not what I expected in terms of size or construction.  I was looking for a traditional 'Panama' style hat for the summer.  First off, the hat is much taller than expected.  Most 5"" to 6"" tall descriptions of hats are usually what's measured when the hat is on and stretched to conform.  This hat is 7 inches tall right out of the box.  I figured 'great, it should crush down to comform a bit' but no, it doesn't.  The height makes it nearly impossible to wear in the car to deal with the sun while driving.  The ""Shapeable Brim"" is also a problem.  The brim is shapeable because it has a wire insert in the outer edging.  The wire limits the ability to wash the hat and god forbid that you bump the brim against a more solid object - instant dent.  I have made theatrical wire brimmed hats and the wire eventfully becomes unshapeable over time as the wire loses strength.  For wire rimmed hats, you put them in hats with brown or black color materials covering them to hide the eventual rust stains."
"I only wore these around the house so far, but I like them. I stretched them a bit for my weird toe and added inserts for more comfort. One day, I may even have a reason to wear them outside. I'd give 4 stars, but the suede is more nappy than I wanted and when it's not brushed correctly, the shoe looks pretty awful."
"Good quality shirt, but I ended up returning it.  It was a gift for my husband and he didn't like the look once he had it on."
Doesn't fit my 9 month old
"Boot is gorgeous...soft supple leather and killer style, but after wearing around the house for just a few hours, they were pinching down on the tops of my toes...and they were not too small, in fact, they were slightly loose since I ordered a 1/2 size up to allow for thicker socks and tights in the winter.  What a bummer since the boot is a great style."
Order a size bigger than your shoe size.  I am a size 10 wish I had gotten an 11.  They feel great at first.  Just don't go on a long walk or you will be dreading it.  After about a 2 mile walk in Hawaii I took em off and walked bare foot.
"I really like these boots but there are a couple of reasons I didn't give them a 5 star rating.  They are synthetic, not real suede, though you can't really tell my looking at them.  Also, I usually wear a size 7 and I had to go with a 6.5 to get the proper fit, and they are still a little roomy.  But that's because they are medium width, as most shoes are these days.  Really wish manufacturers would make narrow widths more often.  All that being said, a pair of cushioned insoles and my smart wool socks make them comfy.  They look great on!"
"These shoes don't hold up to wear and tear the greatest, but we've ordered these in two different sizes as our daughter's feet have grown because she loves these shoes. On one pair the Velcro started coming apart, so I glued it back into place. And both pairs have gotten quite scuffed up with ordinary use. The uppers are hard to clean due to the material. But again, my kid loves these shoes so I'm sure we'll wind up buying them again when she outgrows her current pair."
"well the textile looks good , finishing quality isn't there are various strands here and there and one more thing if waist is in the range of 46 - 50 inches don't order the XXX size because it will be bigger than your real size by at least 8 more inchs"
"The style of this tunic shirt is really cute. I love the length of the sleeves, and the shape of the neckline. The bottom hem is fun and floaty and would be really flattering... But I can't wear it. It fits fine on my torso, pretty well, actually. But the sleeves are so tight that I could barely get them on, and then I could not lift my arms. This is a weird thing, as I can't recall ever having trouble with the sleeves of a top not fitting me. The fabric is pretty stretchy, but also very thin, so I wasn't going to try to pull and stretch it, as it looked like it might tear if I had tried. I ended up giving it to my very, very thin teenage daughter to wear. The fabric is thin enough that she has to wear a tank top under int, or it is see- through in the sun light. Also, the neckline is wider than expected (on both of us) and is basically an off the shoulder blouse, which is cute, as long as it's what you are expecting. Over all, it is a cute top, and she will be wearing it, but the proportions just seem off on this one.
I received a discount to purchase this top and give it an honest review."
"Needed the wide width. Very narrow although ordered a larger size. Wore twice and says they're too tight. Can barely get them on. Cool shoes, just didn't fit our son's wide feet. Better for children with narrow feet. Will give them to my nephew."
Nice but broke after a week
"Returning boots.  Just not comfortable, especially right one.  My feet are difficult to fit and my current hikers are by Hi Tec and I could not say enough positive about them.  They are probably 10 yrs old and fit great.  Insides have begun deteriorating.  Hiked up to 20 miles a day in them with no problems.  Finding old ones irreplaceable!  I hate to give these boots a mediocre review, but they did not fit my feet comfortably."
"A bit different than the pictures, not exactly what I was expecting, but they work."
"love the fabric, so warm and comfy, but i'm 5'9"" and these barely make it over my knee :(  i'll still wear them, but not quite the look i expected."
"I usually wear a 12 wide or 13 regular. I had to buy this in a 14 wide for it to fit.

They're not bad once you find the right size. They break in quickly, but don't offer much traction or toe protection.

If you're in highschool and just want to look redneck worker class chic this is definitely the boot for you."
"There's a big difference between small and xtra small!  I tried a small on in the store which was too big all around, even in the waist with the elastic, and got an xtra small online and the waist is tiny!  Even with the elastic, I can hardly pull it on.  I'd wear them in a pinch, but they're a little uncomfortable.  Also, a little too short for me!"
Work fine. Looks okay.
Nice looking shoes if you need wide width maybe change the soles out because they are terrible.
"Ordered a size larger, very small made. Still should have ordered 2 sizes bigger"
"Stone is bluish-black, darker than the photo shows.  It's set real low, so it looks more like a band ring than a eye-catching gem.  The sapphire would look larger if it was set a bit higher.  Diamond chips are extremely tiny, dull in appearance, and blend right in to the platinum plating.  Lotion and stuff builds up easily in the side crevasses, so the ring has to be cleaned & scrubbed frequently to keep any shine at all.  Simply put, this ring looks a bit dull and understated on my finger, not the prominent bright blue sapphire with shiny diamonds I had hoped to received."
"Leather cuts across the bottom of the big toe which becomes uncomfortable....insole is very, very comfortable and shoe is attractive with capris."
Look good but loose
"I was disappointed in this shirt, and am returning it. I'm 5'4"" 142 lbs and ordered a Large as I like a loose fit. Even though it fit perfect in the shoulders, the rest of the shirt looked very boxy and masculine. The sleeves were way too long. I didn't think the 3% spandex would make much difference, but to me it is not nearly as comfortable as the 100% cotton shirts I ordered and am keeping. I also found the fabric too heavy and stiff, but then I live on the West Coast, so perhaps someone in a colder climate would appreciate this shirt more."
"I wear this watch several times a week.  It's lightweight... so I don't even notice it on my wrist.  I like it's appearance.

But... take notice of a few things.

The backlight does not really do much good.  And, the crystal is easily scratched.

At less than $20... it's a good buy."
Bought two pairs of tall sweat pants for my son These were not long enough at all and very fitted.
"After reading some reviews, I ordered a size up. It's hard enough finding shoes in a womens size 12 as is. But I had to stuff the shoes for them to stay on my feet when walking. They're not very comfortable either. I wish I'd returned them. They look nice. They don't fit the best. And they're just not overall comfort-driven, with the material rubbing against your feet."
"Too flat, but satisfactory for the pool."
If you plan on spending any amount of time out in the elements I recommend getting a thicker pair of gloves.  If this is just to cover your hands while moving from the house to the car or completing a quick task outside then these might work for you.
"I love the look of these shoes, color was great. Size was funky, returned for a half size smaller and they were too big too. I wear a 7.5 but prefer an 8 as I don't like my toes touching. Ordered a 7.5 and then a 7, returning them both, but will keep trying as I LOVE MY FIT FLOPS"
"For a large, this tank runs small. Next time if I order, will order extra large."
I really do like how this looks. The only thing that upset me was when I tried it on one of the straps wasn't properly sewn (or possibly not sewn at all) resulting in the strap coming undone.
"I should have ordered a smaller size, but the Canvas Lace Up Flat is otherwise very comfortable."
"I love the design, and that they have a special line of pretty products to support UNICEF.  But they need to revisit their finishes; the gold finish has completely worn off on the raised parts of the underside of the cicada, and I've only had this bracelet for about a month and I don't wear it every day.

The price here on amazon is discounted, however -- UNICEF won't get as much but you also aren't overpaying for a product whose quality isn't up to snuff."
"its too large,This size is not expect"
"Very nice looking shoes that I wear to the office (dress code) and they fit well, two things to consider:
- out of the box they stink: air them out for a few days in the garage.
- they are about 1.5""-2"" longer than all my other shoes: my very frank and speak-their-minds friends haven't commented but since I know I feel like I might be wearing clown shoes."
"beautiful looking shoe, comfortable height, shoe sizing is problem, normally I'm an 8 1/2 so I ordered a 9, way too small, then ordered a 10 1/2, too big, settled with a 10 which was ok length wise. But my biggest problem with these shoes is they are so hard in the toes that after 2 shows they're still not broken in. My toenails (which I had cut all the way back) on both big toes are completely sore and thought they were going to fall off. I'm getting different shoes for the next show. Beautiful but very uncomfortable."
"I would give more stars except that they are slightly large, meaning I slip around a bit in them. I measured my foot to get the right size for me in a mans shoe. This is the smallest available and should be correct by my measurement.  Otherwise, these are awesome sandals and very comfy...if the shoe fits."
"Great shoes, but way too small. My daughter wears an 11 now (New balance specifically) and so I ordered the 11.5. We could barely get them on her feet, they are very narrow and her toes were right at the edge. Had to return them."
"The pants arrived and were of a much thinner quality material than I expected. They also were very,very,long. I ordered a 29 inch length and they were more than an inch and a half too long. All three pairs were returned."
"The ring has a wide band looks thinner in the picture if u wear it alone it's fine but u cannot wear it next to a real silver ring
It will then look cheap it's okay for the price if you don't iwear it with other rings I
Don't have long fingers so it's a little to wide for me"
"Nice idea and they are comfortable but I'm 5'5"" and these are really high water on me, practically capris. I like the fabric, it is light weight but feels sturdy. The right leg however is a good 2"" shorter than the left and the tie is too small. I can't get the tie to my waist so I have to knot it around my upper hip, which for those who like numbers is 42""."
"I ordered the largest size (XXL) because Asian sizes always seem to run small, and I'm glad I did. For reference, I usually wear a size 8-10, my waist is 34 inches, and I am 5'5. Absolutely do not go by the Amazon size chart. The seller has their own size chart with the item pictures. The size chart is a little weird, or maybe my body is a little weird, because I usually wear an 8 or 10, yet my waist is 34 inches, but the largest size has a waist measurement of 33 inches, so that doesn't line up quite right. Anyway, the skirt has 3 to 4 inches of elastic in the waistband, so there is a little wiggle room. I recommend going by the waistband measurement as opposed to your dress size. The 33-inch waistband fits around my 34-inch waist just fine, lol. The elastic definitely helps with comfortability. Because of the elastic, I can wear this skirt a little lower, about two inches below my bellybutton. Either way, the skirt falls just below my knees.

The fabric is thicker than I expected. It's silky on the outside. There is no button closure above the zipper to aid in zipping the skirt. The cherry blossoms on the fabric look blurry and not as pretty as in the pictures on Amazon. The stitching seems okay for now. I ordered the skirt in green, and the green is a pretty medium green, a kelly green, I would say.

The fit is weird. There is too much fabric and it bulks up in weird places and makes me look chunky. I don't know if that is due to my body type or poor design. It's obvious, now that I look back at the picture on Amazon, that the skirt is Photoshopped onto a model. She isn't actually wearing the skirt. I thought the skirt looked good in the picture, but now that I realize there isn't a picture of anyone actually wearing the skirt, I'm wondering if the fit is bad on everyone. My husband says he likes the way it looks, but his judgment can't be trusted, lol.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this skirt. Maybe if you were in a store and could try it on, yeah, sure, if the price is right and it looked good, I would say get it. But buying it online with how unpredictable the sizing is and how weird it fits, I really can't recommend it. I think this style of skirt would probably look better on thinner people.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"This shirt fits okay, but it is a regular fit shirt, so it doesn't hug your body very much. There's a bit of extra cloth since my body is more triangular than square."
A little odd fit but still cute.  The bottom half is very very short.
I loved this bag but the zippers kept getting caught in the linings. I could fix them but now I have one I cannot fix without fear of ruin. I contacted the company by email about a week ago .No answer from them .Buy at your own risk.
Was the same material as the other ones I bought
The purple ones are way lighter than the ones pictured. The color on the stems also peels off after a while.
"SPACER vs EMBELLISHED

This is a comparison of the Maidenform One Fab Fit Extra Coverage SPACER vs the Maidenform One Fab Fit Extra Coverage EMBELLISHED UNDERWIRE bra.

They looked very similar to me so I thought I'd buy both and see what the difference was.  One question/reviewer on the SPACER bra stated that it was simply a matter of nicer and thicker fabric.  This is NOT correct.  A spacer bra is supposed to do exactly what it says, space your breasts apart.  For this bra at least it has nothing to do with the quality of the fabric. The Spacer fabric does have far less stretch/give which is intentionally done to keep your breasts from squeezing together.  The Embellished bra is a memory foam and therefore will conform more to your natural shape rather than forcing them apart with stiffer fabric.  For reference I am a 36C/D and did not want my breast to be spaced apart.

PROS and CONS for both:

STRAPS:
- Spacer bra has thicker and more padded straps than the Embellished bra.
- Embellished bra has a non-slip silicone type grip on the underside of the strap that really DO work.  No slippage at all.
-Embellished bra straps are thinner, more standard thickness, no padding or cushion on the straps.

LACE DETAILS:
-Both bras are pretty and have lace details but in different places.
-Spacer bra lace is on the side panels all the way around the body that hangs down slightly over the seam. Therefore itchier and you can definitely feel it on your ribs and back.
-Embellished bra has lace stitched to the side panels with no overhang so you can't feel the lace at all.  Less noticeable as the lace is under your armpit area.
-Both panels have a lace triangle between the breasts, no noticeable difference in feel/look.

COVERAGE:
- Spacer bra has more coverage on the cups so less overflow.
-Embellished bra is softer and conforms more to your cups.

FABRIC:
-Spacer bra feels cheaper, more stiff and scratchy with absolutely NO stretch at all in the cups (again, intended to shape/space your breasts apart).
-Spacer bra fabric is stiff, so much so that the bra was bent in the package and the crease remains even after machine washing twice.
- Embellished bra is a soft memory foam and is actually soft to the touch all around, including the straps. No creasing after packing it and travelling and bending it all around in my drawer and washing machine.

THE VERDICT:
Maidenform One Fab Fit Extra Coverage Embellished Underwire lace bra with nonslip straps is more comfortable, softer, and most likely better suited to more breast shapes as the memory foam will conform to each body easily."
I would say it's about a 1/2 size too small. We'll see how it washes & dries...
Earrings are very light weight but for the money they were a good deal since they look fine when I'm weraing them
Good to wear it to sleep. It is soft and comfortable. The material is too slippery to tie the knot.
"Doesn't really fit over my glasses, but the lenses are nice."
These socks leave a trail of black fuzzies wherever you go. I would not buy them again. I guess when you opt for the low price you get the cheap items.
They were out of Smalls so tried this in M..was waaaay too large
"The bag was disappointing.  The fabric is unattractive (somewhat shiny), though it seems well made and serviceable."
These fit ok. Just like the picture.
"Cute, but not comfortable"
"These are OK. They don't irritate my ears but they are kind of pretty. Some of the posts are set off center, and some are set crooked. I mean for the price I can't really complain too much."
"I was very hopeful that these shoes would be just the thing for me, since we are required to wear black tennis shoes for work.  I was hoping that the ""relaxed"" fit would be good for my slightly wide feet, and that they would be comfortable on my feet all day at work.  Unfortunately, I found them to be stiff in construction, and the footbed was hard on my feet.  They are also heavier than I expected, and kind of clunky-looking.  All in all, I like the cheaper Skechers that I purchased a couple of years ago better."
Didn't like the collar but it will work with a tank n shorts
A little big but ok
Got this for my 2 yr old daughter....I purchased the white...it is beautiful but the white looks grey.
"These shirts are decent, but a little tight, especially in the neck."
"Good quality as can be expected from diesel, but this jock was just way too tight in the pouch - made it uncomfortable to wear beyond a brief workout."
"Fit perfectly and the fabric is very silky, but the yoga mat material has zero give and is less comfortable to stand on than an actual yoga mat. Returned."
Fit is large. Had to return.
"Was soooo excited to get these boots.  The pic online was blurry, but I thought they were cute.  The boots came and they are ok.  They are kinda flimsy like the material from a halloween costume or something.  And, as most other reviewers said, this item runs EXTREMELY small.  I am normally between an 8 and 8 1/2 and went for a 9 based on the reviews and even with no socks on I can barely get them on.  I would have gone for a size 10.  Overestimate the size, expecially since most people wear boots like this with socks."
not bad for house slippers.
"It looks great, love the colors, but as the others said very hard to cram his foot into the shoe even though I bought extra wide. Don't think he can wear this for very long."
"This device WILL remove the back covers fro watches, but are a bit difficult to use.  If you work with them a bit they get easier to use each time. Were worth the money for me anyway."
Was hoping to wear this as a dress however it is too short and need leggings.  Otherwise it it fits well.
These are very narrow and uncomfortable for walking around even just in the house. Maybe they'd be OKAY just for driving but I can't use them.
These boots are a little tight.
"It's OK, just somewhat large"
"I wish there wasn't a huge logo on the waistband, but fit well."
Pretty bracelet. Kind of a tight fit on the wrist and I am of average size.  Have had it for quite some time and the finish has not tarnished.
The material is really nice and I love the dress but the sizing chart is WAY off. I am a 16 and I bought a XXL to have it be a little big so there was some extra room. It's definitely not an XXL. It is incredibly short and very tight on the bust section. If you are anything bigger then a 15 don't buy this dress!!
Cute and looking forward to wearing by the pool.
"Well kids, sad news.  Based on reviews by other tall women, I ordered this skirt, but alas, it was just not long enough for this 5'11"" frame.  It hit at the awkward ""above-the-ankles-but-clearly-not-intentionally"" point.  Blast!  I really wanted this to work.  The color was ON POINT, the material was flowy (that's a word right?) and delightfully girly.  My other issue was the size.  Even with the warnings about it running small, I wasn't quite prepared  for just HOW small it ran.  This one was a tight fit.  If it were long enough, I would have returned it for a larger size.  My search for a maxi skirt for a tall girl continues..."
"Tough to get on until they finally stretch a little over time...if they last that long, that is; the hose area on the legs tears VERY easily. If you're not careful, you will rip them the very first time you put them on. The seams in the crotch area eventually wear out, too. Otherwise I love them. Have been buying these and ""Assets"" for years. Assets are almost as slimming, more comfortable and less expensive."
"I didn't realize they were little socks. And not even great socks at that. They're cute, but not impressive for the price."
It's well made and pretty. I don't love the fit on the arms and think it runs too short. Definitely not as baggy as the pic shows
Great product/price. Size medium fits my 5 year old who is tall for his age. Giving 3 stars because the elastic on the mask broke within 10 mins. Not sending it back because I can sew it but kind of a pain .
"These were pretty comfortable. However, the side zip pushed against my ankle bone and was very uncomfortable so I sent them back"
"It was on time and in great condition. The second time I washed it however, the seam around the neckline unraveled. I'll get it fixed locally. Quality control is the only problem I had."
"This is super cute and I love it. It is a bit smaller than I expected. It isn't worth returning and I am currently working to get back into pre baby shape so it will fit better in the future, but it isn't something I would wear right now. Which is sad because out of the three different styles I purchased ( different brands all same size) this is the only one that didn't fit and I expected it to be my favorite."
The dress looks nice but saw some overlap stitches on the rib which looks its about to wear off and some black dye on the rib is noticed.  But its just smal so theres no big deal on that part but.......... The only not so nice about the dress is it doesnt come with a panty insert which really dissapointed me. I don't want my baby diapers showing all over so i have to get a black panty insert to cover  my babies diaper. This is something new to me for i know all tutu dress comes with a panty matching but this one DONT.  IM GONNA RETURN THIS FOR SURE
I love Tsubos and have a 1/2 dozen pairs of their shoes. The toe on these new Tsubo designs are narrower than previous sandal models. I don't like it as much and returned them.
Very nice looking bag. I would have given it another star but the material the bag is made from is extremely stiff. Love the colorful lining but wish bag was a little larger. Will just about hold a kindle if you don't have much else in it.
"these boots are really cute and warm, but the sole isn't supportive enough for a full-on walker, which i have on my hands suddenly.  most of the sole is soft and slippery leather (or faux leather, not sure) with just two patches of tread in the center.  my little guy is a big mover and he really had trouble keeping his footing with these on.  he ended up slipping and splitting his lip at the playground.  if he weren't running around on his own yet i think they would be fine, but not for us at this stage."
Fit as expected but color was too shiny; returned it
"They are comfortable for me  and will do what I want (short wear periods, light weight. I ordered the larger size (I wear 10.5, so I got 11). That is still a close fit, but OK. They work for me, but may be too narrow for a wide foot. No arch support at all. Pretty thin sole; cheaply made. I expect them to wear out or go to pieces in a few months, but who knows. Not good for a day-long office/clinic work shoe. Go with Crocs for that."
My feet may be 2 different sizes but the left foot fits great. It did take awhile to break them in but once I did they feel much better. My right foot still is a little tight but these shoes give my back great relief after working for 12+ hours straight
Was way too large. Had to give it away.
"Cute top, pretty color, but wash a few times before wearing. Blue dye transfers a lot!"
"I purchased this backpack as an alternative to the hip-slung gym bag I was using previously.  It does the job I need it to do, but everything inside gets wet if I have to walk in even a very light drizzle.  Any portion not sheltered by my umbrella will soak through immediately.  I didn't expect this to be watertight, but the fabric is downright absorbent.  Don't use this bag for anything important, or you may regret doing so.

Also, this is a bit smaller than I expected it to be.  I really have to work hard sometimes to cram everything I need into it, which is a bummer.  Eventually, I'll replace it."
I'm small in all pants but can barely fit my thighs in them
"They arrived promptly, and looked to be well made, but this is definitely not ""OSFA.""  And ""higher-waisted"" still showed my crack...so unfortunately, these go back.  Lots of cheek and crack :)

5'7"" 140lbs"
Leggins are nice BUT they didn't last more than a day! The material is same like nylon tights so that makes it very fragile. My 7y old enjoyed them for a day. Therefore I'm giving this product only 3 stars.
"Color is more of a true khaki color somewhat different then the picture shown. Waist band is relaxed, true to size but not really skinny style,"
"I am 5 foot 6, and this poncho only covers half my arms. It is very thin material. Seems cheap compared to similar priced brands I've bought at big box sporting goods stores that were waterproof canvas with rubber like backing. I understand it is packable,  but still very cheap for the money. Do yourself a favor and buy the canvas packable poncho."
"Warning....with this seller, product is shipped from China, so LONG shipping. If you are in a rush to get this for an event, I would find a different seller.  Also, note that it is 100% Cotton.  Don't typically see that any more and I didn't catch it.  They shrunk terribly even in cold water and delicate cycle on the dryer. You have to wash immediately due to the TOXIC smell. It did go away after washing though. Print is of decent quality and shirts were the same color. Apparently that has been an issue according to other reviews.  Due to shrinkage,  had to reorder from a different seller, as not enough time to reorder, and, wasn't going to waste the postage to return. Would not buy again."
An okay dress but a bit cheap looking! I would not recommend this one!
I didn't like them at first because they're kind of cheaply made. I expected them to be a higher quality because of the name brand but I guess not. I got use to them after a while and I wear them a lot.
I gave this a 3 star rating. Why? It looked really nice and it's a great price at $5.... But why is shipping more than the cost of the item?
"It didn't fit right, but it wasn't worth sending back. It was fast service."
Not the shoes fault.  I read the other reviews and ordered up a size.  They were way too big.  They are cute and I think would be great if they fit correctly.  I suggest ordering your normal size.
"I tried getting these shoes in a wide width to compensate for the tight toe box.  It did help the fit in the front of the shoe, but made the heel much too wide.  I had to return the shoes.  Wish that Merrell would make a version of this shoe with a roomier toe area."
Very nice quality but runs small. I wear a 10-12 with a D cup and ordered a 16-18 but the top is still way too small.
"Great looking sneaker, looks better in person than online.  But does not run true to size.  I ordered a nine which is usually just right or perhaps with some shoes, a little on the small side.  These were so big I couldn't wear them.  Since I don't like to pay return shipping, I gave them to a friend with a slightly larger shoe size."
"Ok, not as ""gel"" comfortable as anticipated. Colors too much for my taste."
These shoes are OK.  I really bought them to see what size shoes my LO wears.  He's walking now so I don't like the fact that under it is soft and they look kinda cheaply made as well.
"I love the color of this top but I really wish I had noticed the sleeves -- they are capped with a little pouf at the shoulder that is SO UNSTYLISH.  They are poufier in real life than in the photo.  It kind of negates the super cool style of the rest of the shirt, so I don't usually wear this anywhere that I want to look fashionable.  Also it does run small-- I am typically a S or XS and I ordered a M for this top and it would not fit if it were any smaller."
Kind of chintzy. Not made to last a long time. It worked well as an activity bag for my daughter's carry-on.
"I don't be sure of the locking systems locking were the yeopsseumnida .
Lock, so we know that you could worn submerged, I drop it for a watch."
Good for ballgame tailgating.  A little too big.
"I work in a business formal office and purchased this pump as an alternative to my more delicate-heeled shoes. I ordered several other practical heels and found that this was the best option aesthetically. First, the vamp is low enough to provide support without being matronly. This was a major issue with other shoes in the comfort category. Second, the almond toe adds a level of classic sophistication that its rounder and pointier counterparts often lack.

The chunky heels are great for stability, but the angle of the heel will drive your foot into the toe box. In conjunction with the low vamp, this becomes a problem as you are likely to get corns on the top of your toes. These shoes seem to run slightly large, so if you order in your usual size, you might also have to contend with a significant space between your heel and ankle. It makes walking without slipping out of the shoe a conscious effort.

Overall, this shoe scores high marks for stability and (relative) attractiveness, but it is not as comfortable as you would think."
Had to take the toe out (handicapped and feet are deformed at bit). I actually got them before the June 9th date.
"The fit is as expected. However, I was disappointed in a manufacturers flub that appears on the outside of one the shoes."
"Our daughter is 4 months old and this is HUGE! We ordered 0-6 months. She will be able to wear this next year. Hopefully. It's huge. Too bad no 1 st thanksgiving in this outfit. Cute, but runs waaaay to big."
"I got this model of Sketchers in a dark purple on clearance at a national discount retail chain that sells name-brand items for less.  I would not have purchased them unless they were on clearance because the fuzzy material, which is really like a soft felt, picks up a LOT of lint, but I thought I'd give them a once over with a lint roller, and clean them up.  But, the properties of lint attracting is ongoing.  I have two small dogs, and my Sketchers are now a furry addition to the family.  These also don't support as well as other Sketchers I own.  (I have 4 other pairs.) So, I am deducting 2 stars for these reasons. However, I am giving them 3 stars because of how I use them and they suit my purpose rather well.  I use them as slippers.  They support much better than typical slippers, but not as well as regular walking shoes or sneakers.  I have wide feet in general, and a regular 10M in these stretch out quite a bit after ""broken in"" for a few days due to the nature of the felt fabric.  They are more comfortable than any other pair of slippers I've ever owned.  They don't slip on the floor like regular slippers, and, you can walk outside to get the mail after a rain, whereas most slippers are for indoor use only.  Sketchers should market these as slippers, not walking shoes."
These shoes are very well made & I really wanted to love them.  Unfortunately I tried 2 different wide sizes and they were both too narrow at the toe.
"It would have gotten a 5 if it had gussets in the arm pits and back.

I have a Berne Chore Coat and it has all that plus the elbows, which the Carhartt has.
But it's long and I couldn't find a waist length one without a hood, or I'd had bought it.

My second choice was a Polar King, but again, I couldn't find one without a hood."
"Everyone keeps talking about how big this dress is...I would say that is a fair assessment EXCEPT for the sleeves.  The sleeves, unlike the drapey/capped look in the photo seem to be sized for a tiny teen t-shirt which looks VERY weird on a dress that is so loose and roomy.  The pockets...Oh LORD, what a hot mess are these pockets.  They just leave misshapen lumps on my hips.  If you are stick straight or have no waist and size up to positively tent size, this might not be an issue."
"Great looking shoe, but feels at least a half size larger than the Gel-Equation 7."
You get what you pay for.......
"I loved the top, the style, and the material, but it was too small. I like tops to be loose fitting and usually wear large, but ordered extra large according to size chart. The top was tight fitting. Returned the top."
I order medium u want a mini it's short if u want a little more cover pick large in USA  however the color is more of a gray then coffee I thought it would be more shiny like pic but it's not exactly that color but still looks good  I wouldn't expect  that shiny coffee color that's all ...
Not as soft as I expected my baby keeps pulling them off her head.
tangled but worked for my princess sernity cosplay
Well made skirt. Very stretch material and a nice length (it is a mini but not too short) this item is going to be used by my wife for work. 100% recommended. Just order a size down
"Got these for our 4.5 year old, average build boy. They fit, but won't for long. I should have paid more attention to the color, too, which is completely on me, but the first ones pictured on Amazon are ""Hunter"", which is kinda greenish, not black. I'm buying the next size up, in black, though."
The mask was missing from the package when it arrived.
"The hoodie I received  has one fault, the hood is so small compared to my other hoodie's. I like having a large hood on my hooded jacket."
Buy a larger size if your man has broad shoulders or muscle tone. This is made for a super skinny frame. Does not stretch or have any give to the design.
"smaller than it should have been. next time I order, I'll make sure I order a size up."
"A bit thick and puffy for my taste, but the color is beautiful and the price is right."
Somewhat small fit and the straps like to fall off my shoulders.  It was NOT racerback - just normal.
Item that arrived was a similar but different version of boot than the one pictured.  The item that arrived had a toe cap stitching and no heal tab.  Seems like a minor difference but that's not the item I ordered.
Bought three. One wouldn't allow the combination to be set. The other two work fine.
Hand wash needed. Fabric began beading wobbly
This wig looks good but it is a little small
I was unaware there are no pockets.
"These panties aren't bad. Not great, but not bad. If you're looking for something comfortable enough for everyday wear? Go for it. These would be great for 'that time of the month'. However, If you want too be comfortable AND want to look good? Skip these and buy in-store instead. These are not cute low rise bikinis, these are ""granny panties"". These are panties that you can get good use out of, and then toss out without caring or missing them.

Wondering about colors? I ordered the assorted solid color pack and i received two dark magenta, one light pink, one medium blue, one light purple, and one dark grey/nearly black.

Pros: Full coverage. True to size. Reflectively comfortable. Not too tight in leg openings. No bunches. No thread unraveling (so they claim) Colors aren't terrible.

Cons: Not 100% cotton as advertized. (50% Cotton 50% Polyester) Certainly NOT low-rise, as advertized. Not available in solid black packs."
"I've been buying this particular style and brand of pants for almost a decade - I really like them. Well I bought several pairs recently and they were great as usual - only problem is this particular pair are the wrong size. They say the right size but they are definitely (almost two inches) smaller in the waist. Since I didn't check them for almost two  months after I bought them - it's my bad - I had the local tailor take out as much as possible and I'll make thenm work.

So try them on..............."
These were not meant for me I guess.  Tried 3 sizes and wasn't able to get a good fit.  Very cute and I love my other Reebok shoes but just couldn't get these to work for me.
"The styling looks great, but they get HOT when walking a lot.  And where the toe is the inner part of the shoe sags down so it rubs on the top of my toes. Not sure if its a defect or not, but it doesn't bother me enough to return them.  They are average comfort and its hard to find a good casual style steel toe that I like."
I wish the straps were a little stronger and the suit a little longer. It fit well but my trunk is long and the straps didn't like that.
The colors are beautiful and I like the material but there needs to be a belt or a sash because of how the material falls. It is really comfortable but comes off a little like a maternity dress.
"these shoes would be good for someone with a wider foot. they are very comfortable and light. however, the strap seems a little flimsy like it might break after a few wears. I was unable to wear them for more than an hour because they were just too wide for my foot"
"This is a beautiful piece of costume jewelry. The ""stones"" shimmer and it does look very real. I received quite a few compliments on it. I used this as my replacement engagement ring while my real one was being cleaned. The only downside to this ring: it turns your finger green. Sad, but expected."
The longest part of the dress is not centered :(
"Disappointed that our bibs arrived with a dent in them (from how they were folded and stored for shipping) that will absolutely not come out!  They still work fine and do a great job, but I'm frustrated I can't get the bend out in the material!  Otherwise, they wash up well (dishwasher top rack too!) and don't cause any skin irritation for our son."
As an avid Keen fan I had higher expectations for these boots. They run true to size & did take a couple weeks to break in which was fine; they felt great after the initial break in period. The reason for the 3 stars is because the soles started to come apart from the rest of the boot 5-6 months in and completely blew out 9 months in.
"I purchased these to replace a very old pair of Van's that were purchased in 2008 and have seen some heavy use. However when I received these in from UPS. As I went to put them on with out even lacing them up I felt like I put a size 15 on. I have returned these although I loved the way they were styled. I am ordering another pair from DC but size 17.

My girlfriend who wears a size 8 we went to local mall and she ended up walking out with several DC shoes but all in size 9. I should of figured that it was like that for all sizes.

The shoe fits UK size 15 and USA size 16 I wonder if they really aren't just size 15's with the wrong label on them."
They're a nice looking boot and waterproof. Big around the ankles for that reason not very comfortable.
Love the fit. They started falling apart les then 2 weeks. So disappointed.
Beautiful skirt but too small.
"After reading the reviews, I ordered a half size down. The length was perfect but the shoe is narrow.  For one foot it seemed to fit fine.  For the other, it felt a bit snug but in all fairness, I have plantar faciitis in that foot, so it may have been a bit swollen at that time.  The heel seemed pretty stable.  Overall I bought the shoe because it was cute and I needed a cute shoe for a photo shoot and don't plan on doing a lot of walking in it.  Even though it is a bit snug, it will serve its purpose.  If I was planning on wearing them regularly, I would have definitely returned them for my true size."
"super cute, but a little small for my calves.  Not too small to wear, just small enough that there are gaps where it buttons together.  I'm 5'11"" and am 150lbs, with average sized legs.  If you find that asian one size items are often too small for you, these are no different.  They will be cute peeking out over boots though so I will still keep them."
"These gloves are huge,  basically for a man. I didn't recall seeing a size option for them."
"These just don't have enough support for people who need good arch support or support for pf, unlike some people stated.  Perhaps they work best on younger people with feet issues or people who are not heavy.  Part of the front around the toes also rubbed into my foot. They do look nice on and make a great dressy sandal for people with minimal feet issues."
Love the dress to small  my Daughter where's a size 7/8 I should have got a 9/10 and it's see through
"Too stiff.  Does not sit right on the torso.  But it is a nice top, just not the type I wanted and thought it was."
Fits should have gotten size bigger
I thought it looked great but was too small
"I changed the ribbon out, and it worked great."
This way not even close to being a size 6. We had to re order a size and half bigger . Other than that they are very light weight and come with pink spikes which my middle school daughter liked.
"Nice, comfy warm long johns, however, the waist band is weirdly large and won't stay up on my son, but it fits him everywhere else. Unless u have a large waisted child, i cannot recommend these. I will end up sewing the waist band to alter them."
Nothing fancy. It just looks okay.
"I swear this looks better on the mannequin than it does on me!  It seems small, but that could be because I have a large head:)"
"These seem to be well made sandals but much more bulky than the photo image.
For older men this is slightly dangerous
On one hand the sandal has support well made, but so bulky that is causes possible tripping.
Looking for a style with the strong support, strong sole but not bulky. Not sure there is such a sandal."
"Today I ordered two mediums of this dress, in black, because it was selling out of stock.
The previous reviewer notes the fabric was heavy and stiff in the item received.
No prior review or description on Amazon's or Merrell's sites convery the product is constructed of a heavy fabric.
Amazon could serve its fabric afficianado customers by listing the weight per ounce or pound, and flexibility of the textiles, or give some indication of drape, flow, or 'hand', before we order.
When my orders arrive, trust that I will supply a detailed review."
Light weight and not what i was hoping for..Not good for colder weather. Fine for Summer outdoor wear.
"I like the look of these sandals. Super cute I am a 7.5 or 8 and can usually go either way, but because of the straps in this shoe my foot often slides back in the sandal and my heel hangs off the back and there's about an inch and a half of space between my toes and the end of the front of the shoe. Because I can't get my foot to fit snugly in the shoe and these don't come in half sizes, I'd recommend these for people who are truly whole sizes only. My foot never fits securely into the thong part no matter how tight I strap the ankle."
I expected the color (green) to be somewhat like the picture but its a totally different green
"The dress is very cute, however it was just a little too form fitting for preferences for office attire.  I returned it."
The next time when I order I will go one size larger.
Decent for the price I guess.  My little Link fan loves it so that's what matters.
Cute but the size chart is a bit small
Good quality fabric and thicker than others.and the fit more high waisted. I would suggest buying a size up.
These are SO COMFORTABLE but they run small. And they are NOT wide. I had to return mine for a size bigger.
A bit smaller and less sturdy than expected.
These run very long.
"I have owned a couple pair of these in the past & love them....however, these are super small! Not at all the size that you will normally wear! Buy at least a size up!"
"These are made in china, cheap bags, nothing is sewn, all the seams areel heat bonded, not sure how they will hold up, but for $1 each.. they're ok"
"Cute, but not as warm as I had hoped. I guess if you want real warmth, you need to go with 100% wool."
This is a nice looking shoe but is so uncomfortable in the width.  I thought after wearing them a couple of times they would give but didn't.
Picked this up for a couple of 5k's and work costume party.  The green hair paint was craptastic at best-green hair spray worked much better (less running in misty weather and the quantity went further).  The white face paint was the best product in this set-it worked for 2 Joker events and was borrowed to use for Harlequin for 2 events too.  The black and red crayon sticks were mediocre-the black was not dark enough and couldn't overpower the white make-up and had a grayish hue when applied over the white make-up-black eyeliner worked better.  The red was just sad-it was much easier to use a cheapie 99cent lipstick to effectively obtain the red hue desired.
Is closer to a size 8 than a true 7 1/2.  I have this ring in a size 7 and a size 8.  At any given time the 7 is too small and the 8 is always too big.  No one usually carries the 7 1/2 so when I saw this one I jumped on it.  Unfortunately I think the ring is really an 8 because it fits exactly like the 8 I currently have.  The ring is pretty  and exactly like the other two I already own.  It's a lovely ring and I get tons of compliments on it.  At the price it isn't worth sending it back.
Good gentle cleanser. For what you pay though there is better on the market with out the hidden harmful chemicals.
"These are okay. I ended up using metal luggage tags for exterior luggage identification tags and so as not to waste these, used them for identification INSIDE the suitcase because they could be too easily removed or snipped for the only exterior ID."
"Great fit, however not as supportive as is needed for large bust.  I don't think that it will hold up well."
"Nice quality material, not the cheap see thru kind you sometimes get. However, it runs really small, I normally wear a 3x but got a 5x based on sizing chart and way small. Will have to return it."
I have very narrow feet and they were a bit tight.
"Not s good, thought it was better"
Purse  was made well but had to return as it was too small for me.
"Very cute, but cut too large"
"actually...not the best.  fabric is thin.  Seems that clothing is being more and more cheaply made.
I've always bought Jockey and have been happy with how much wear I can get out of a pair.
Now skeptical ...too bad"
this product is going down hill = come back to america
"Not meant for narrow, skinny feet. Nice color combination."
"I'll keep these jewelry organizers that I ordered because they serve the purpose, but they are very cheaply made and would not have purchased them if I had seen them in person."
"The stones were not as clear and bright as I would have liked.  Kind of dull.  They are small, but I fully expected that."
"These boots are GORGEOUS and I love the stretch backs, but the toe box was too narrow for me.  I usually wear a 10b, and I would definitely have needed a C for these boot.  Sadly had to return"
I would have rated higher if they didn't run a little small
"The size was perfect, as were the pockets, and I always love Baggalini. However, when you fill this one up, it tips over. Poor design should have been fixed before this version was sold."
it fit a little small and i don't like it that much. i got this at a reduced price for my honest review
Was larger than expected...
To big for me Id mate a mistake
"First this is not a replacement for a bra its not a real Cami. If you need to wear a bra under it please do.
I specifically got this for an island vacation coming up where heat and humidity are almost unbearable for most people.
This IS NOT FOR COLD WEATHER AND WILL NOT KEEP YOU WARM.
I am a breast cancer survivor and can't wear wires or tight elastic.
The  ""soft cami ""means shapeless and loose but for my purposes it works.
Its very pretty and looks even better in person.
It may be a perfect fit or slightly large its hard to say.
I am a size 6 but I always order large on Amazon because Amazon tends to run small. But this is large on me and it would be if it were a true fit."
"This shoe is cheaply made. When you bend your foot or stoop down, this shoe stays bent out. I have a narrow foot, much space on side. I
still wear it, at times, but it is not something I would buy again."
"The costume itself is nice, however my 10 yr old son wears size 12, and this 14/16 was quite snug. The back had to be left undone..because it kept coming undone anyway. I'd say it is more of a 10/12 size. Definitely need boots with this costume."
Very cute necklace but VERY tiny. This would be perfect for a little girl/tween.
"This robe is not what I had hoped it would be, wish I had listened to the other reviews of this robe.  The color is more of a brownish red, and not really a pretty burgundy.  It is quite flimsy, and don't think it will last long as it is poor quality material."
"Should be good for yard work, wanted something I could hose out after use. Something to cross a stream and then hang on the backpack to dry out. I don't think they are for all day use but the sole is sturdy with good traction."
"Like many others, there is no padding so it digs into your skin"
These run really small. Am hoping a half size up does the trick. Very light weight. Don't yet know how they wear.
the cup is too small
"after having read numerous reviews online about how the v3 falls apart at the seems, i decided i liked the look of the shoe enough to purchase it anyway. The shoe is very comfortable, and i can wear them all day. but those online reviews turned out to be true after only just 3 weeks. Amazon has sent me a replacement, so im hoping these fair better, but i remain hesitant."
"Still nice earrings, I would not expect too much from them.  It's not like they are meant to be your nicest pair, but they were a little bit bigger than you would like if you just wanted something to replace some old studs or other assorted earrings."
"super cute, but way smaller than expected"
"I really like another type of Carhartt cargo pants- the B260 line.  They however have been discontinued and when I contacted Carhartt they referred me to this style.  It is NOT the same.  The material of these is much thicker, which could be good for some people.  It will protect your legs more when moving around in the woods, etc.  But it will also wrinkle like crazy and not look good, even with ironing.  The B260s had velcro on the pockets, these have snaps.  They snap securely, very securely so this could be a plus for some, but it makes getting my wallet or phone out of a pocket more tedious.  If you leave them unsnapped they make a lot of noise from the snaps hitting each other.  The cloth also make much more noise than the discontinued B260s so not great for hunting.

I was looking for pants to use for work.  I'm a meat cutter so they have to look professional and be very durable but still comfortable with plenty of pockets.  The older B260s were fine for that.  These are too stiff, hold wrinkles, and have pockets that aren't as convenient.  So now I am looking for a new brand of pants.  Thanks Oba....err...  Carhartt.

However they do fit fine, and are very sturdy, so if you are working as some place not so customer oriented (meaning they are not trying to make big ugly meat cutters look socially acceptable), these might be fine for you."
Fits more like a long sweat shirt but cute.
Nice colors but some of them was dropping time had to be reset over an over again
"My GF was too excited to order this and wear it. But within hours of wearing it, she was tired to stand on this for long hours and was cranky enough to roam inside the office barefoot. Would recommend this for parties and functions where you don't need to wear this all day long.
You do want to tire yourself, do you.."
"Normally, I really love Bunnies by the Bay but when I received the Bunny Beanie and Bootie Gift Set I was a little disappointed. I was hoping to use it as a stand alone baby shower gift for a close friend having her second girl. However, upon receipt, it seemed a little, well, small and insignificant to give to such a good friend. The hat is cute and so are the booties but as other reviewers commented the booties do look big and will probably never be used. For the $23 plus tax I spent I could have done better. If you are purchasing this as a gift I would caution that it doesn't seem like a lot of bang for your buck."
"It's okay, the fabric pulls very easily - glad I bought it on sale."
"wearable but even though the mfg tag on the sandal says size 12, made in china.  my size 12 bass pro shop sandals almost identical also made in china have another inch toe room length wise.  otherwise ok."
"Its nice, but the chest cutout looks oddly placed. The woman in the photo has a really nice body. But not everyone looks like her and for the average woman, the breast area looks odd. I had my friends try out the dress and the consensus was that the heart shaped chest area was oddly placed."
Decent shoe at a super price
The toe of the shoe was a bit narrower than I expected - making it a little too snug across the toes.  I will be returning the shoes for that reason.
"Sizes are much smaller than in size descriptions. Had to request a much MUCH larger size, and I think it is for a very athletic woman. The zipper is on the opposite side. Wha?"
You have to be real careful when you put your purse strap through it. It still falls in the floor if your not careful.
"They fit, but not for a woman with an actual butt, they were big in the front, and didn't cover my butt at all."
Sou-sou.
"These shoes are cute and comfortable.  The size chart is not very accurate, as they run very small."
Hard to put on...
"These are very cute, warm pjs but fit a little small in all of the wrong places. I would order a size up from your normal size if you buy these."
"just put this way that it look very awkward. Does not look sexy at all when you wear it. However material is good,"
"fits perfect for a petite woman, being 5'1"" and 124lbs the medium fit me perfectly and is okay for the fall time, and a little bit of wind, but winter time temperature is not okay. The jacket has already started to tear apart in lots of places and the arm is starting to come undone in the sewing. Like, I paid 40 dollars for it to come loose after how long? No."
"Can't complain about it for the price I paid for it. Took a long time to receive it, however its super cute; especially the bow-belt that comes with it. You will need to wear a slip under or a neutral color bra as the material is pretty see-through."
Have used a similar product in the past that stuck to my skin well and was able to re-use every day for about a month. This product does not hold up to the same level as prior product. I can maybe use for about a week or two with daily use. Its cheaper but sometimes with cheap you get what you pay for.
"I normally spend $80 on m'Leggins from CAbi and they wear out in one season. These are super comfy from the second you put them on, have a ton of give (which is nice because I've gained weight), they're warmer (which will be helpful for my Ireland trip) and they're soft and I love how black they are. I will TOTALLY be buying more of these. Love that the skirt is longer than my CAbi ones but still shorter and several inches above the knee so you still look cute and stylish. Love these! Update: the first time I washed these the seams on the skirt TOTALLY unravelled and have huge gaping holes around the entire skirt seam that is supposed to attach to actual leggings. I loved these so much but after one wash and them doing that I will not be purchasing more like I thought I would. The thread wrapped itself around my other laundry and it was a complete nightmare getting everything untangled. Also, I have a washer that does NOT have an agitator so it washes with delicacy. These are definitely comfy and even more comfortable than my workout pants but one wash shouldn't make a product unwearable."
where the waist is slides up and is uncomfortable and the after a few washings the underwire on the sides come out
"They would be OK for very average size hands, but one-size fits all gloves seem like a dumb idea to me. They look OK, but in my experience the don't fit. To be fair, I wear an XL glove, and purchased these accidentally after asking Amazon to show me ""men's gloves XL.""  I would prefer that Amazon searches show me only what I ask for."
"What I bought was blue.  This shirt appears to be more of a teal.  Not a bad shirt, but I didn't appreciate slipping me a color I didn't ask for.  The picture of the shirt being advertised is blue, not teal.  When the retailer pulls a fast one like this chances are you won't be getting my business in the future."
"Great watch for the price, price doesn't reflects its quality. Great work watch"
"I wear think socks with these shoes, and they are still pretty big, to the point of slipping.  And they are not as comfortable as you would think being crocs.  Even besides the slipping discomfort, being on my feet all day they hurt and throb at the balls of my feet and my heels.  I am a server, and bought them because they are not supposed to slip, they are the slickest shoes I have ever had.  Horrid for walking through a kitchen all day.  And very dangerous.  Only good thing I really have to say about them is they are easy to clean."
"Again, as with another pair of these jeans in another color, the legs fit nicely - BuT- the waist is so very big.  Had to take in about 8"" which is not hard to do, but, somethings I shouldn't have to do.  When will someone realize that not all larger sized women are the same size everywhere.  I do have a waist line! Start making cloths to waist and inseam measurements, not what looks nice on the tag!  We all would be happy shoppers with fewer items being !
I kept these jeans because I need them now and stores in my area, which are very few, do not carry jeans in the summer months, so there was no choice.
Would I buy them again? Maybe not!  Probably Not!"
They lasted for about 6 months of house wear....so can't complain.
"Too big for 4-year old, have to return."
looks like a slim fit in picture...far from it...baggy
"I wore this once at my school for International Week. My class's country was Egypt.  It fit like expected, but was very itchy.  I was glad I only had to wear it for a couple hours."
but still a very warm coat
It is transparent fabric.
"This serves my purpose for storing watches.  Not all my watches fit into the compartments, but for the money, it is useful."
"I ordered according to the size chart but this bra does not fit like it should. The cups are not really cups but rather padding in a stretchy material. The straps are not adjustable so it is what it is. I think it would be fine for smaller busted ladies but it didn't work for me. Also, the one I received appeared to be a second. The stitching was off and some of the edges were not properly finished."
"I am 5""2 and about 170lbs.  I really liked this dress but I have to wear heels with it or i step on it. If your 5'4 or taller this dress is great, if your shorter then that i would not go with this unless you plan to make alterations. It fits nice, and looks good just to long."
Received a t-shirt with entire band--and had no time to make an exchange before my daughter's birthday.  She was happy with the one she received.  Thank Goodness.
Cute shirt is as pictured but runs a bit small if your busty
if you have a wide foot these shoes are not for you...
"The pendant was very pretty, but the description was kinda misleading.  For the price, it was a reasonable deal, and different from the mall jewelry available locally.  Didn't expect otherwise, just an observation."
"I ordered this based on an article I saw online stating it was suit that looked amazing on everyone!  I gave it a shot, but alas, it did not look right.  I'm 5'2"", 150lbs. 36C and I ordered an XL based on other reviews I read.  I originally wanted the blue flower print, but it was sold out so I figured I'd give the black flower print a shot.  It's definitely cute, but it reminds me a little bit of an old 80's print couch you would find in a house in Florida.  The top and bottom both fit well, but it was just the style that didn't work for my pear shaped body.  I think I may give a non-print suit in this same style a whirl and see how that goes."
"I love his shirt but it runs pretty small. I wear a 1x in normal clothes. I ordered a 3x and it is a little smaller than I would like. I will wear this, just not as intended."
Cute but don't hold up after many washes.  Wanted to provide warm footwear to guests so they wouldn't wear shoes in the house.  Suited that purpose
"Meh. Its okay I guess. Definitely very tight, which I think it needs to be for swimming in the ocean, but it kept riding up for me."
These are fairly cheaply made (fabric) and developed a hole after wearing about 5 times.  They fit fine though and they are light weight (so not too hot when working out).
width is small but the strap across the top of the shoe is super loose. So it doesn't work well.  doesn't support as well as you might think.
was expecting the top to be the color as it appeared online... it is not as vibrant but a duller blue...  though nice fitting top.
"Worked well for about a month now the clips give away, and I'm a small guy. 125lbs 5'6"""
"Great shirt except the neck hole is a little small.  Maybe if your baby has a normal head it's OK, but my baby's head is in the 97th percentile and this shirt is difficult to get on.  He's not a fan of me jerking this shirt down over his face."
These are very cute but after the first time wearing them the material on the bottom of the shoes are wearing off and it makes them look terrible.
"Be warned- they run a bit small in girth, but the length is rather long.  If that's what you're going for- super.  They are very thin- you get what you pay for, but a good bargain if you're in the thin side."
"I was excited to get these shoes but the pair I received looked like they had already been tried on and returned by someone and there was a large scuff on the toe area.  Fortunately, I have a suede brush and I have been able to treat the scuff.  I am keeping the shoes because they are versatile for my mostly black and grey wardrobe and I have been having a hard time finding shoes like this but I feel like I was sold a pair of used shoes for the price of new."
"wound up being too small, not what my Hubby expected since all his other clothes are the same size. Disappointed."
The only complaint i have is that the lining does not go down the sleeves. it is in the hood and chest like a vest but the arms are just heavy knit material. If i wold lave realized this when i purchased it i would not have done so.
I really like the fit but the plastic on the sides dig into my skin and leave marks.
THIS IS A WOMAN'S WATCH!  I wish it had been listed as such because I did not like the surprise of how small this watch was upon my wrist.  It's too bad they don't sell a larger version of this watch because it is a very nice looking watch and it was very easy to set.
"I liked the style of the boot, however I didn't like the shiny finish on the leather. It shows that it's a matte finish, but it is rather shiny."
"It is as i expected.  I am 5'8"" and 170.  I wear a 10 -12.  Eventho the other reviews said it was too small, i decided to take a chance.  The dress is too short for my height, so i bought some dark brown tight shorts that match the brown in the arm & leg bands.  I have thick thighs so the dress was very tight at the bottom.  Since i got the shorts anyway, i decided to take out the seams on both sides on the bottom.  Now it fits well enough for the parties coming.  The material of the dress has NO give."
Need some cushioning
"These socks need to be broken in, otherwise they affect blood circulation. The 94-year-old woman I bought them for couldn't keep them on long enough for the elastic middle to loosen through wear. She isn't able to walk much. May be fine for a younger person who walks more."
"A little pricey for the price to pay because of the limited number of pockets to provide useful compartments for storage,"
Was winter type fabric.  Not what I wanted at all.
I got white and they were incredibly see through. I like them I still wear them I just use a long top to cover my ear end when i wear these
"I ordered a size larger and it was tight. Also, they changed the photo after I ordered it so it looked dull and drab. I was looking more for a brown color that looked similar to suede."
They are of okay quality. They do show though. At least on my feet with my Coach tennis shoes. Maybe if my foot was bigger it wouldn't show in the back.  It did get smaller after washing. It claims to be a sport liner. If you are looking for padding there is not any in these. They get the job done.
Great but large
"These are alright for the price. I do think the picture makes them look MUCH nicer than they are - they aren't tight on my legs, but they still don't stand all the way up, there is a fold over the ankle that looks funny. Another flaw is that one seemed to be a different size than the other - at first I thought it was because they needed to be worn and would stretch, but one leg is tighter and the tighter boot also seems smaller on my foot. I still wear them, but I wouldn't order them again as I can get the same quality for cheaper at Gordman's."
they are of great quality but they are too thick for summer.
"Excellent product quality, beautiful but handle is too short for cross body."
"I'm going to give it just 3 stars because I DONT LIKE the belt material, it's really cheap (like plastic), but it's really good looking and I like it."
"Boots were great! Just fit a little bigger than expected! Very comfy though and I'm ok with them being a little bigger, I just wear bigger socks!"
I like them. They are prettier in the picture...
I gave this belt a #3 rating because the chemical they used to soften or die the leather is really strong and it actually gave me a headache. The leather is ok quality but the buckle is kind of cinchy. If you do order one get it one size bigger than you would normally wear. I might recommend it to someone.
Cute but the fabric snags rather easily.
"The glasses fit okay but the lenses are a little too big for the effect. I gave them to my husband who is going as John Lennon for Halloween and I ordered a different pair from another company. I am going as Yoko - hoping the pair I ordered are a bit smaller. Otherwise, they are okay sunglasses."
"Jacket arrived with broken zipper on left hand warmer pocket. No amount of tugging or manipulation of the zipper could get it to close.
Definitely not cool if you're wearing the jacket in even a light rain.

Perhaps the jacket was a return or just a defective product, who knows?
More trouble than it was worth to return it, so the local Goodwill donation box has it.

What a shame, it was otherwise a nice jacket."
Not as long as we wanted
"Looks great but the material is very stiff with very little give,  if I drop something it's over because I'm not gonna bend down in these"
"The shoe fits well, but is not well suited for the professional kitchen environment.  My husband has slipped twice in this shoe and now I am researching how to have the sole re-done to make it safe for him to wear.  Disappointed I am having to do this."
"After reading reviews, I ordered these. Many reviews said that they do not roll down and when I put mine on for my event, they kept rolling down at the waist. Couldnt wear them, as the roll would be obvious and so I returned them."
"I thought for Madden girl boots that they'd be a little nicer. I do like them. They are a little snug. I normally don't wear wide boots but I'm glad I bought them because otherwise they would have probably been tight. They do run a little small. I can barely get my foot in the bottom part of the boot. I'm usually a size 7 so that's what I ordered but if possible I'd recommend  ordering a half size up.
One other thing to note these boots aren't quiet. The chain on the back when you walk makes noise. It's not a problem but it moves around!"
Its really thin material and super long. I thought it was going to look way different.
I had bought a pair of the Easy Spirit EEZEE TIME TRAVELERS before and I lived in them until they are falling apart...probably 3 years.  They no longer make those so I ordered these.  The fit of this shoe is strange. It is tight at the instep and loose in the heel and just a little long. Not enough to warrant a different size..just one of those shoes that will never be  perfect.  They look nice and I got them for a good price. I would not keep them had I paid full price. They are making the bottom of my feet burn but I hope that is because they are new. I will never love these the way I loved my EEZEE TIMES.
The quality is good but they didn't fit as expected so I returned them.
"I loved the shirt. I needed it to work. I ordered a 5xlt. However the sleeves were way too long. The length of the shirt would have worked great, but because the sleeves were too long, I had to return."
Looks nicer in the picture
"First, I though it was a longer coat and not a short jacket -- and a medium fits me like a small -- I should have ordered a large.  But since I lost money on one return -- I didn't want to do it with this one. :)  So, I just kept it -- I can always give it away since it is such a short jacket - wouldn't help if it was raining."
For an XL it run like a small
"works , not spectacular but good enough"
I actually love how these look but the posts are thick and hurt my ears
By the picture I didn't realize that there were straps that go under the arms making it difficult to put on.
"I used this bag last summer. I was very happy with it. However, I agree with the poster who said the bottom sags. In fact, I am not using it again this summer as the sagging looks pretty bad. I think the bottom has to be lined with a more rigid material."
"Didn't like the material.  Thought it was going to be denim.  Also, the blue color will fade quickly.  As usual, a good fit.  Good price, but will return."
the wrist strap came off when i pulled the tag off. other that that not a bad personal umbrella. i would recommend a larger umbrella though.
Don't know
"I'd rate it lower, but they had excellent customer service. My wife only wore this 3-4 times before it started unraveling at the waist seam. She contacted the company and they were quick to respond and tell her it must be a lemon, and they shipped her a new one that day. However, the same thing happened with the replacement. She's planning to use Fabri-Tac to fix the seams and thinks that will work. Still, we're disappointed at the low quality."
they run small i'm 6.5 and they were a bit tight so i recommend going bigger not as comfortable no cushion inside but i guess if you like columbia wear you will like it i wouldn't buy it again so i return it
I ordered a 3 x thinking I wanted a very large comfy sweater (I am a size 18)-the sweater is not large at all.sleeves are a little tight and a little short and it cannot really close all the way..I kept it since it doesn't look bad and though snug it works with a decent shirt under it.
It's ok. When walking quick it doll does roll properly or keep up instead in vibrates and bounces around making it difficult walking at the airports
Not sure what my previous brand was.  I wear boxer briefs when I'm going to be walking all day long to prevent chaffing.  My last brand worked fine.  I still have chafing with this brand.
I bought these when I was on the hunt for good uniform tights.  They are okay but because they are more nylon than cotton they won't last long.  It is a good thing they weren't expensive!
A little see through. Not prom type dress...maybe for a nice summer cocktail dress.
"This is a simple and beautiful nose stud.  When it arrived, the post from the bend to the ball was too long, making it stick out too far instead of sitting flush against my nostril.  I used pliers to straighten and re-bend the post to make it fit exactly the way I wanted it.  I purchased two studs (white and yellow gold) and had the same issue with both.  if you're okay with DIY-ing your nose jewelry, I would recommend purchasing this item."
It's really bulky at first but eventually forms to your foot which is really nice lasted for a couple of months but slowly starting to get ruined like threads are coming undone and the sole is wearing out which is dissapointing but really cute and comfy got many compliments
did not receive the shoes that were in the picture (color wrong)..  wanted leopard print with silver trim... received leopard print with black trim..  sizing alittle small
"Nice boots but cannot wear as they are way to big. Listed as 6.5 but these are actually at least 8! Seem to be made very well and look great, i just cant wear them :("
"The shoes are fine, but the inner slipsole is glued, and with the water it loosens and moves, but then glues in a bad position, so it turns uncomfortable, until I fix it manually, but this happens again every time I wear them. I'm thinking in removing all the glue. They sould be glued in a different way, like by stitching it."
"I love them, they're my favorite color and I have been looking for them for a while,  I was excited when I received them then I wore them the next day at work and they were super tight. I had to take them off half way through the day because my toes were literally numb. I've been trying to stretch them out but not having much success but I will keep trying.  I'm glad they sent me half a size bigger instead of what I originally asked for or the review would've been lower but I still love them."
"Very heavy material. That made it nice and sturdy, but since I bought it for a trip to India where it was going to be incredibly hot, was almost too heavy to wear. Good quality though."
"I bought the shorts in white, and they are really too sheer to be worn out which is what I intended on doing. I suppose they're fine if you just wear them under skirts, but you can find cheaper ones elsewhere that probably do the job better."
"i USE THEM, BUT I WISH THEY WERE A BIT MORE ACCURATE REGARDING SIZE"
"Wife has worn these shoes through several iterations, but these did not work for her.  Regular size was too small, and even a 1/2 size up pinched her on the top.  Too bad."
These shoes doe run a bit small. But they are very cute!
Kind of cheap but good enough for how much is paid for the product.
"The fit was good. I'm 5'4"" so it's a little longer on me than I would like, but it fits perfect  in the body area. Also, the coat is thin. I wish it were thicker, but it'll work. The faux leather sleeves are a nice touch."
Only need my glasses for reading.  Now I don't misplace them.  Item works as expected.
They look a little cheaper than I expected. Red color is very very bright & some of the buttons aren't on quite straight. Good for costume shoes.
Did not stay up.
In the picture it looks better than it really is.
The color wasn't true to the website picture and the hat was too small. The hat was packaged well and shipping was fast but it will be going back.
LOVE LOVED this onesie. I washed them and put them on and discovered a hole in the seem on the leg. I'm going to repair it myself because I can but someone who can't would either have to throw them out or have someone do it for them. Other than that I love them! Super soft and comfy just not sure the quality is amazing.
The bracelet to fragile to wear and not very song metal.
"The design on this romper is super cute but the material ended up being too shiny than what is pictured so it went back. Fit looks to be on the smaller end. My son is 4 months old, 27"" long and 16.5 lbs and could fit into the 6-9month size."
"to narrow, returned them. Otherwise cute"
Its' OK
not quite the quality I expected from amazon.
"Waaayyy too big.  Mediums usually fit me perfectly (5'6"" muscular) but this was nearly down to my knees and like wearing a trash bag..."
They hurt my ankle.
"i was excited about purchasing this sandal and although i read that you should order up because the sandal is narrow, i still bought my regular size anyway because i have very narrow feet. however these were too small! Even though they are very nice. If i ever buy timberland sandals again i will definitely order a 1/2 size up!"
"Bought two packages of these. Very nice cotton, soft comfortable and good quality, but every-single pair broke apart at the right seam in a month or two of washes. Can be easily sewn back together, but unfortunate."
"This jacket was really warm and the fabric and material was great. But it was too large. I usually wear medium size and I ordered the same size. The sleeves had very bad shape though (they were puffy around the arm) and caused it too look even larger on me. It was something that was not clear on the model in the photos.
I returned it."
Good thing I bought it as an ancillary gift not as the main gift.  Its a little cheap looking in person.  But for the price its ok.
"The sole was pretty wide at the front, but goes slimmer and slimmer when it reaches the heel. It hurts at end of the arches when the leather around the heel starts."
"Good mailing packaging, but was dissapointed that about 30% of the gems had chips and/or deep cracks.  The quality is good. And the cuts were good quality as well. Its just that half of the good gems were damaged.  Ill be buying again in the future, perhaps this was a bad fluke. Hopefully the next order will be less damage. On the bright side shipping was fast and packaging was great. So I know that either theirr machines damaged the stones or they mix them semi intentionally."
A little longer in the leg than picture shows.
"I like this brand of clothing and have purchased briefs in the past - however, the quality seems to have gone down - these seem a little thinner.  They are still comfortable, but I don't think they will hold up wash after wash like they used to."
got 1 size larger than normal and they were too tight on my heels
"This is very beautiful shoe, looks very pretty. I wear 6 in clarks and never had any issue with sizing. But this one gave me extreme pain on both side of the feet near the small toe mound.i wasn't able to keep this on my feet for more than half hour. something with the toe box design. Fortunately I could return this, but I really wanted this to work for me since its such a cute shoe"
"The shoes are pretty stiff so it's taking some time to break them in.  They are not the mesh type but rather have leather or immitation leather for the body of the shoe.  I reaally love the ""easy tone"" shoes but prefer the mesh style more."
I needed a pair of gladiators to go with this outfit and I liked how the straps were spaced  out except for the ones in the front which bunched up when I sit. I just wished that it was made with additional straps so that the ones in the front were evened out.
"tight and stiff. Very disappointed.
UPDATE: being forced to wear this more than once, I have come to appreciate it. It doesn't hold on to lint and pet hair like my other shirts. It doesn't pill in the dryer. It is warm. It is still stiff and a little tight, but maybe I just need a size larger."
"LOVE, but stinks like fish. I have ordered several Scarleton bags and this is the first time I have had this happen. But I am hoping to get that smell out. IT is HORRIFIC! but a beautiful bag and quite roomy."
For the price it's good. Really note that model is 5'2'' bc Im 5'5'' and my butt would have been completely out.
"Looks oh so much better in the picture. The fabric is pretty nice feeling - but BEWARE - it's not washable or dry cleanable! -- spot clean only!  so if you sweat on it, just plan on throwing it away. The gown and hat were pretty plain. That's not a real belt, it's just sewn on the front. The sleeves were way too long -- I tacked up the sleeves' hems at the outer edges so the purple could show without my having to hold my arms up all night.  I had to take up the hem (I'm 5'4"") too. No broom comes with -- You should try to have some jewelry, props or additional costume accessories to be happy with the look."
I didn't care for the fabric in this tankini top although the fit was good.
"The product was pretty good for the price. I have a large chest so the design gets stretched a little. Overall the print is lovely, it sticks together once it comes out of the package but after a wash it's fine."
"I wanted to like these, I tried two pair.  The soles were very supportive, but the ankle strap became too uncomfortable when my feet swelled.  I returned them."
Good fitting shoe that looks good. It somehow isn't as good as good for walking as I would have thought.
the are too tight
Image is not as pretty in real life.
They r nice. Too much yellow tone highlighted in the set
I can barely get in it. I'd suggest sizing up if you have a large bust.
"Liked the looks of the purse, but it was too bulky/heavy, even without anything in it."
"Really cute, the only thing is making them lay/stay on your feet when you walk. They should of had another chain on them to lock them in place."
Straps could have been wider. I used this for my briefcase for work. The straps just became unbearable and had to retire it.
Seems light and a bit to large but well made.
Cute but tight around the tummy
love the fabric of these - super smooth and comfy.  but they're too small!
"Ordered a 2 and it said it runs small, I figured that should be fine since it laces up. But it is HUGE! the laces nearly tie shut! It's also extremely long!

Very pretty though, looks even better in person! Got lots of complements!"
"I wanted shorts for playing softball and these work fine but they fit slightly smaller than I expected - I even ordered a size larger since I wanted them to be slightly loose but they fit fit, and then they shrunk"
"I bought a large and when I received it, it didn't fit. I guess I need to change it to a xl instead of just a large."
They are not as soft as the ones that I buy at another retail store.
really cute but buy some cups to sew in for support.
Ordered my bf a large and it fit great until he washed it. It shrinks quite a bit! Get 1-2 sizes up if you like your shirts a bit bigger than snug!
fit a little small.
"It doesn't matter what size you get, these are totally see through! You can really only wear these under your shorts, not AS shorts. Also they rode up my entire work out so it kind of defeats the purpose of wearing them under your shorts. I had to constantly pull them down. A little small and could probably just be worn as underwear."
"Cute, but it is not something you can easily wash, also the ears do not stand up like they do in the photo.  Our son liked it for Trick or Treating though."
"The print and colors are really cute, and the price can't be beat.  However, it turns out that with this one, you get what you pay for.  This is an ill-fitting kimono that runs small and hangs a little lopsided.  I am really disappointed, as it is not worth returning."
"Get ""pills "" after two washes. It's like a bad t-shirt"
"Fits a little wide, so not good for those like me with skinny feet..otherwise a nice shoe like all other Enzo Angiolini's shoes are.  Nice sole and comfortable inside."
"It is hard to get placed so that it looks right and then I find myself checking it all the time, but its ok"
"While I actually like this shoe, I'm not exactly sure why it isn't offered in a wide size like all other styles of Birkenstock shoes. I like that is is light, easily cleaned, and is water resistant. But just wanted more of a wide fit as this seems to run in my opinion more narrow than a normal shoe. Other than that it is great."
"My husband is 5'7"".  I bought him this fleece to wear at work when the office gets cold.  The jacket fits fine through the body, but the sleeves are a little short.  I bought him the medium.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone taller than my husband. It was a good buy for the price though. Where can you find a fleece for $20?"
"It's a little heavy, but useful for what I need."
"It was so wrinkled, it took nearly an hour to iron it. There were no cufflinks. Good shirt, lousey packing and shipping."
"The hat was cute but I had to return as it is too large for my small adult head.  I thought ""Junior's"" sizing would be smaller, but it is the same size as my Women's patagonia trucker, which also comes down over the top of my ears."
"This bra fits good, it makes your breast look good. The only thing I don't like is that the cups are not molded as it was described when looking at the product description. And since they are not molded it seems as if the cup size is a bit bigger then it should be.
A molded bra I feel ( went from C cup to wearing a DDD cup after two children ) gives more support then a non molded cup."
The watch constantly freezes but my five year old won't give it back to me to return it. At least she loves it
Not nearly large enough. Found another pair same size that fit well. Sometimes just in the make.
"The material is more of a very soft/cheap t-shirt material. I thought it was more-so the stretchy fabric that many shirts are made from. So, although it looked okay, for the event it was ordered for, it was not quite up to par for my taste."
"I love these shoes!  They are very well made and unique. I gave them 3 out of 5 stars because I had to order 2 sizes up. I normally wear 5.5 but ordered a 6.5.  I tried the 6, but they were too small. Order up!"
Nice but they aren't as comfortable as expected.  Also don't match perfectly.  I didn't notice until I wore them outside.  They are OK though.  I don't think anyone will think I have on two different shoes.
To large to look real.
"Bought same size (L) as previous...but this pair much smaller. Sad cuz waistband tight/uncomfortable for sleep. Also waistband much thicker, not much give."
Larger than i expected for my head. It's comfortable and diamond white. I didn't get too hot. The front ends wouldn't seem to round out but I couldn't figure out why.
color is lovely. not confy for long wear.
"Ehhhh. I was a little disappointed with these. But it's just because they don't fit my body the way I like. They fall off my waste, and not because I'm crazy tiny (I'm pregnant, even), they just don't have much of a wasteband. They are also slightly too long (I am 5'4"") and the ankles are too lose for my taste. I had ordered a three pack of these a while back and they fit much better - must have been a different company, although it was the same image."
I ordered xlarge even though I'm large because tried the last shirt at Amazon a large and came as a boys size. This one's cut was very generous. I kept it because is a pretty shirt even though is as thin as a sheet of paper.
"I wouldn't call this a slim fit.  Otherwise, a good product."
runs a bit small for this brand
"I usually wear a L/XL, and they fit nicely. Not tight. I bought an 8XL by using the sizing chart. It fits but is a very fitted fit. I am 5'2"" tall and it reaches just past my butt. I'm very busty and will have to wear a top under it & probably leave the top few buttons open. The material is nice, a little heavier than I expected but that's ok. It washed up well."
Cute shirt but the sizing chart is inaccurate. I usually wear a size 6 and following the measurements on the sizing chart provided I followed it completely and bought a large. Huge. It is a gift for a similarly sized person and I will return it for a medium. Bust sizing on chart just wrong.
"They are wide, but I had to tighten the closure so the earrings would clasp shut. Not a good start people. Had I not had to do that, I would have given it a 5 star rating. Other earring I bought were similar only differences was my other earrings were heavier in weight, way less money and I didn't have to adjust the closure."
"These earrings I gave away as a gift, they was okay looking but NOT for me..."
"Cool item, but starting to rip after a couple times of wearing."
"This didn't work too well - one side didn't flip like the other, but our 7-yr old loves SpongeBob and he wears it anyway."
"I love the look of these shoes, but it seems to push your body forward with walking in them. I am hoping to wear them enough to break them in before my trip to Vegas."
i like this but as soon as i ordered and want to reorder they raised the price so i will buy no more. i was born on a Thursday but not last Thursday
"The fit is ok, but the jacquard fabric is really itchy. I could not deal and gave up. The back is ok, but i like satin tracings better for back fit also."
"This was my first pair of Buffalo jeans, so paying the price of not actually trying them on or knowing anything about the brand was a serious roll-of-the-dice. The pants actually fit great and are true to size. However, there is nothing worse than boot-cut jeans. Well, besides Skinny Jeans....leave both styles to the women and EMO kids. There was nothng that looked close to boot-cut fit on this picture. These pants are in fact a boot-cut fit, so if you're looking for a pair of pants to wear with your wreched Sketcher shoes, then by all means, this pair is for you. If you are grossed out at the thought of wearing womens style pants; skinny jeans, boot-cut....BEWARE."
it bunches in the middle which made it somewhat uncomfortable and it was noticeable through shirts.
just so so.
"They look very well, are very tender, but have to buy a size extra, usually my size 6 and left me really tight, are not very comfortable, the sole is very thin and if you walk long distances you will feel like you're barefoot."
"I purchased the Asian fit Chainlink sunglasses straight from Oakley. I was expecting the matte black finish to be high quality, instead it seemed like a cheap coating instead of the unpainted plastic found on the Standard Issue line of Oakley frames. The Chainlink's matte finish shows oil stains VERY easily. The weight is 27 grams, which isn't heavy but it isn't light. My M Frames (original 1.0) and Flak Jacket XLJ are only 25 grams and are about the perfect weight. I found the Chainlinks to feel heavy on my nose and the nose pads pinch into my nasal cavities creating some fatigue within a few minutes. The earstems have the Unobtanium material and it goes all the way to the frames which makes no sense, but the earstems are placed in a way that actually interferes with opening/closing the ear stems.

The Asian Fit frame fits my face, but the actual frame surrounding the lenses gets in the way BIG TIME. I used to think my Scalpels were like blinders for a horse until I tried the Chainlink. The sides of the frames pretty much block my view of the sideview mirrors on my car. It always made me feel nervous about passing a car because of the lack of peripheral vision. The frame on the bottom blocks a lot of the view as well due to the small lens size. Because the Chainlink is relatively flat, there is a lot of open space between the face and the edges of the lenses. When I walked around a windy beach with my Flak Jacket XLJ's (which pretty much hug my face even at the corners of the eyes) I still got some sand in my eyes. With the Chainlink, there is absolutely no protection on the sides - so sand/grit would easily fly in, and a lot of sun will be leaking through the sides. For the uninformed, the Asian Fit differs from the regular version only in the nose bridge and temples to fit heads that have smaller noses and wider faces. Everything else about the Asian Fit is the same as the regular version (same lenses, frame material, etc...) so my comments about visibility, weight, finish quality, etc... would still apply!

Bottom line, the Chainlink is more of a fashion set of frames more than anything. They are useless for any type of outdoor activities that require good peripheral vision or side protection. The matte finish feels cheap and shows off grease/oil stains very easily, and the earstems are hard to open because the Unobtanium/silicone sock material gets in the way.

Overall: 3/5 stars, I'm going to stick with my 6 year old Flak Jackets as they are lighter, more comfortable, offer more protection, and do not interfere with my peripheral vision."
"I like the fabric, the pockets and the extra pen slot on the left pocket, but the cut is too slender for a work or sport shirt. If I had the body this shirt is designed to fit, I'd be shopping at Abercrombie and Fitch. The sleeves bind at the armpit, and the sides are too tapered. So, I can only recommend this shirt for casual use, such as standing around without moving your arms much, and for slender guys without love handles or stomach bulge. Going up a size doesn't really remedy the problem because the shoulder seams would be off and the sleeves too long."
These shoes are fairly good.  I haven't worn them too much since it is winter.  I would have given a higher rating had one of them didn't squeak so badly.  Will probably not wear too much.
"The zipper broke at 3rd use, Is a little too wide"
"I don't hate this item.  The description says ""sexy dress"". It's sexy the same way a sweatshirt is and if I tried to wear this as a dress, I'm fairly sure someone would make some erroneous assumptions about my profession. It barely covers my behind, the bust is a bit tight and the sleeves stop in an awkward place. For reference, I'm five-nine and slim. For this to fit anywhere close to how it is advertised, you probably need to be about five to nine inches shorter than me. However, I always get compliments on it..... Although one shrewd observer did ask ""Is that supposed to be a dress or a shirt?""
The strip of contrasting fabric at the bottom is an odd texture, not unpleasant, just odd."
"I really loved this shirt, but after 1 wash and hang dry the skull face fadded. :( Aside from that, it's pretty true to size, and comfortable."
"Would be better is it didn't say ""CHEATERS"" on the side."
"Love the umbrella.
Holds up in intense winds.
Arrived in a huge box and once unpackaged the umbrella looked like it was dragged across the floor of the distribution center."
"My criticism is not in the quality, its in the fit. They seem smaller and longer than listed. They fit like a tall size. They're very long and they fit like a size or two smaller than the tag size"
"As some reviewers advised I bought these boots a number bigger than my usual size and they still fit a tiny bit small.  I cannot wear them with thick socks.  I had high expectations, I really don't know why... maybe the picture.  They are not really that cute but for the price I suppose they are ok."
"For once what I think is a Chinese product fits. I really needed an extra large but since they did not have one, I gambled and got a large. A little tight but when I loose that last ten pounds, it will be perfect. What I mainly got it for are those cool summer mornings and evenings. No lining, thin material... Just right for my needs. However, I do think it is overpriced for the quality of cloth and as another reviewer stated, it does not hang/drape the way it does in the picture. To be honest, it seems rather cheaply made. Another issue is the cloth buttons:  they were obviously a cost cutting measure; I'm thinking since there are so many, it will be an issue if one gets lost. Since the coat is overpriced in my opinion these things are an issue. It could be professionally sized (if they still do that at cleaners) and maybe water proofed. That will give the material more body and make it practical if it is a sprinkle. If you are buying this as a practical trench, it may not be durable enough to get caught in anything but a light rain. I do like the styling with the buttons down the side but in order for those to be more flattering, you do need to order the correct size which in my case right now would have been an extra large. All in all, I am happy enough with it but don't know if I would buy again for the price."
I love the design but it was somewhat small I'm a medium and I don't like my leggings hugging my hips too tight so I got an XL and they still hug but still totally cute and I can deal with it!
"The waist fit as expected but the legs are just like in the picture, very long.  Not sure why this is the trend but it seems many manufacturers are doing this.  I will have to cut and hem them otherwise they will just get dirty."
"For the cost, it is what it is. Good for short notice. The one issue is the hood is way small. Barely goes over my child's head but like I said for the price it is what it is."
"The ""light fawn"" color is a beige with cool undertones.  The ""boulder gray"" is gray with blue undertones.  The petite has an extra button in addition to the clasp at the top of the fly that the short petite does not have. The short petite only has a clasp.  The leg of the short petite is slightly more tapered than the petite."
"It's not even a year, and the shoe is falling apart. A metal holder for the lace has fallen out of the hole. There is a wide open split in the back of the right boot. I'm not even outdoors all day at all. I put the boots on, drive to work, and sit down at my desk most of the day, and this happens?"
quite wide and a little bit bigger
"Ok this shoe is gorgeous, fits a bit small, mostly on the narrow side, but the reviews did say that and i ignored them and ordered my normal size anyway so that's on me.  I took them to get them widened and looks like they will be ok so that's not too bad but i would consider getting a half size up.

The problem is i ordered this in premium black leather but got the black nubuck instead.  It's gorgeous, don't get me wrong, but not what i wanted and because i ship internationally, i can't send it for an exchange so i will be keeping it and will look for another black leather pump."
"I think these shoes are very stylish and they fit comfortably.  The problem is that they make disappointing shoes to do Zumba in.  They don't have much support.  In addition, I thought they would glide smoother over the floor for doing fancy Salsa moves, but they stick to the floor. So not really what I want in a Zumba shoe.  I wouldn't get these again."
The material for this product was good but the cups could provide a lot more support. There should probably be underwires to provide that lift that large busted women need assistance with. I'm a 38DD and after a child extra support is a definite must. The rest of it was good though.
Not comfortable in my opinion
It's someone small or I really need to lose weight. It's great of for teenagers
poor quality materials.
"Dress is very pretty and would have looked good on, unfortunately it was too small, didn't have a larger size!!!"
"I previously submitted a review for this hat, but I guess if you return an item it is removed.  Just in case others find it helpful, know that the sizing is small.

Knowing I have a big noggin, I ordered the largest size available.  The hat itself appeared to be well made, if lightweight.  The level of insulation is light, but probably fine for temps in the 30s, say.  The ear flaps looked like they would cover properly.  Appeared and looked, as clearly the sizing is incorrect.  I could barely fit it on my head (short hair, too), unable to pull it down sufficiently to test the ear pads, but if you have a small head it would probably be fine.  Just don't order it if you have a big head."
these are nice but they weren't the same size?
lovely ring rather large on a smaller hand sits very high snags everything  pretty to wear out tho get lots of compliments just to much for me for an everyday wear
"These are very cute pjs, but not the best quality. They aren't very soft and after just 2 washes, the lemon decal started to fade.
After a month, they looked very old and worn out."
"The glasses seemed fine, but the color of the lenses is actually more of a green, reflecting pink in certain lights. So disappointing. I'm returning."
"FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a discounted price on this product for my honest and unbiased feedback. Here is my unbiased review of this product:

It shipped and arrived very quickly and I was excited to use it until I opened it.  Although it was nice to have the storage space for cards and other items - especially my passport, I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the wallet.  It was thin and flimsy and not really what I expected since it's designed to hold a lot.  I figure, after a few uses, it will likely start to fall apart, which would not allow you to use it too many times.

However, the idea of a wallet that holds not only your passport, but other items that are important to a long distance trip is definitely a nice feature."
"THE BOOT IS LIGHTWEIGHT, READY TO USE BUT MINES CAME WITH A DEFECT IN THE FRONT OF THE FOOT WHEN I duck THE LEATHER TOUCH MY ANKLE AND CAUSE LITTLE PAIN ON MY LEG. THE INSOLE IS NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS I THOUGHT SO CAN RESULT A BIT HARD WHEN YOU ARE STANDING UP  FOR A LONG TIME BUT WALKING FEELS GOOD...... WORKS GOOD ON THE TERRAIN."
If you are looking for this stone in a larger scale- these are perfect EXCEPT the backs are way too big and you will lose the earrings- i know because it happened to me! Amazon was kind enough to replace the first pair (all I had to do was send back the remaining earring)
didn't fit as expected but giving to my niece sure she will love them
These shoes are advertised with a back heel strap. It didn't have a strap when I received it
I don't want to say to large... more like to tall... they are weird and I don't know how to describe it... but they are underwear so meh...
"This product came to me rather different than the listing describes. Yes, the watch was in the Pro Diver series, but it had a metal band (not leather) and a slightly different set of features than pictured here. Nonetheless, I was impressed by the watch's design and attractiveness on the hand. One should consider when purchasing a watch how large it is on the arm, as the proportional size matters. What I received was nice overall, but because it is not exactly what is pictured I'm quite hesitant to review it higher than 3 stars."
"A little small, but a cute purchase."
"I have skinny legs so I figured that all of the reviews stating that they were too tight would work out in my favor.  they are cute but are somewhat short for their size.  I cannot wear socks with them or there is not enough room for my toes and they smash my toenails.  OUCH!  Also, between the time I ordered them and delivery.. the store discounted them another 10.00.... I should have sent them back."
These are super soft and I love the thickness of them.  I do wish they were a bit stretchier though.  they do fit me but are a bit snug.
"Nice, a little tight."
"Nice shirt, good linen. No holes for shirt studs, will have my tailor add them."
"I bought a size 3, am 163cm tall and weigh 57kg. The hips fit me, but the waist is too large.  After hooking the ""secret"" waistband, I'm left with a gaping hole between the band and the jeans in front. If I don't use the waistband, I am still left with a gap.  The jeans do give my rear a lift which I like.  The 765 in size 3 was strangely too small."
"Love the style and the look but took off two stars because after I washed it I noticed a section of white knit about 1 inch long in one row.  Would not be so bad but it is on the front of the garment.  Cannot remove it since the yarn itself is white and not black.  Looking at options.  Poncho is lovely, and soft.  The ruffles add a nice touch.  Can be dressed up and dressed down.  May get another one in another color but this time I will check it closely and send it back if it has white yarn in a conspicuous area."
Its ok but i am not a fan v of the sleeves
"Shirt is fine, pants were tight"
Bought these for my boyfriend.  Had to return because he likes the relaxed fit and needs the bootie room to work in.
The colors and patterns are great but don't expect much in terms of quality. They are very thin and some already were coming apart at the seems in the heal section.
"These are very nicely constructed glasses that are nice but I think sunglasses should be dark enough to block out the sun. Read/bible Acts 2:38, Mark 16:16,17."
"Fit a bit smaller than expected, but good quality boot.  I would definitely try a different style in this brand!"
well made but a little small
I guess the boot is stiff and I will need to use in order to break it in.  I haven't had a chance to really wear the boots.
NOT WHAT I WANTED THE CUP OF THE HEAD IS TO LONG AND ITS NOT GOOD FOR A SMALL HEAD GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER
could be better made but not bad
"Didn't like as much as my other BareTraps,  but as shoes go - not every shoe is for everbody."
the size runs small. order 2 sizes up depending on the fit you like.
"A lot of room in the body but very narrow sleeves, weird fit at first but got used to it. It's soft and sheer material  so a cami tee is necessary for me. Looks great with jeans or shorts. It didn't shrink in the wash or dryer. No fading so far. I only took star off because I wasn't expecting it to be see thru.  Other than that it's a good alternative casual tee."
like it a bit hard to keep fasten.
The inserts move around too much for travel.
"This could be a nice polo shirt, especially for school unifforms, but it's let down in a number of areas.

- Material is quite thin.  This might be a benefit in very humid climates, but I wouldn't be comfortable with my daughter wearing it without an undershirt.
- Length is on the short side if the intention is to tuck it in.
- Pocket design is nice.
- Fit and finish is just mediocre. Seam stithcing and threadwork is passable.
- Tight under the arm, sleeve on the short side (not good or bad, just a design choice), while the shoulder is quite poofy.  Much poofier than in the picture.

This is just an OK shirt, but we're going to look elsewhere when rebuilding next years school uniform wardrobe."
"First of all these are so adorable. I use cloth diapers so they are a great way to keep your kids legs warm (in the cold months) and make diaper changes (and potty training) a cinch. However, we tried them on very hot summer days. They did seem to feel comfortable and did provide protection from the sun & bugs. I think they are more practical in the fall under dresses for playing vs. traditional tights.  My daughter is not a small toddler and they easily stretched to fit her. Overall I would not recommend these for the summer to protect from the sun as much because they still seem to ""overheat"" the child, but they are a cute accessory for when the temperature is lower."
These are really pretty and fit well but they are a little uncomfortable between toes which is weird since I always where this type of sandal.
"I would have given this 2 stars, but for the low price.  It does I guess what it is supposed to do - blocks the sun.  It does not look great - sort of droops. The fabric is also very cheap feeling.  I would opt for the speedo ones."
One of the backs actually loosened up and so now ive lost it.
Not what I expected but I can use it.
It's not quite as comfortable as my Birkenstocks.
"Price was great but unfortunately the size was too small and moreover, the style was much more matronly than I expected. Packaged back to return the same night I received it."
"these shoes are great for my issue with my heels, however not a good choice if you have a bunion.  ouch!!!!"
Robe was full of loose lint that became airborn when removed from package had to clean carpet other that that it is ok
skirt not as long as shown...its more like a mini skirt.
"Item is made too small for a XL, returned for a refund."
"Not as warm as I expected and there's not as much structure to the boot as I thought, they don't look like the picture portrays them to be! There OK!"
"The sizing is really off for this brand. I bought 2 pair at the same time, different styles by Propet. Normally, I wear 9 wide OR 9.5 medium. After reading reviews, I opted for 9.5 medium. The width was perfect (keep in mind, I wear a wide) but they were really short, so much so, that I had to send them back. I guess I should have ordered a 10 medium. I'm really disappointed."
Quick delivery an nice but definitely MUCH smaller than I expected
Runs large and back heel is quite stiff. Had to return.
"I would give 5 stars for the Monroe jeans. The 3 stars are because I ordered 2 pairs of jeans on the same page. One of them was the correct item and fit perfectly. The other one was a different style and was a bit too large and requires a belt so it doesn't fall down. Unfortunately by the time I realized this I had already cut out the tags and washed it, so it was too late to return it."
A little painful to wear.
"kinda cheaply made, sticking comes apart. VERY noticeable that this is not authentic"
Way too small.  Didnt pay attention to description where it claimed it ran small
I'm glad my daughter fit it and loved it so I gave it to her.  When ordering need to order two sizes smaller next time.
Cheaper material and runs pretty small
"This V- neck was two sizes too small, which in general is no big deal, I get that different companies have different size standards. But the material looked like an gym sweatshirt from Russel athletic, which is really hard to tell from the photos. Did not fit the bill for what I was after and looks a little cheaper/more casual than portrayed in the photo. 3 stars sounds about right."
"Very lightweight fabric, though it did hold up to a summer of swimming trips for my son."
"I only weigh 100lbs.. but I've always had that notorious ""pooch"". even as a skinny girl. OH, ONE THING- i'm a beyond annoyed about the false advertisement  in no way, shape, or form are these steel boning. they are so bendable, it is most obvious they are plastic.  with that being said, it was only $18. you get what you pay for. anyway, I am 5'4, 100lbs, 33/26/33, C/Dcup. I really was not sure whether to buy the small or the extra small. So I bought both and returned one. I tried the extra small on first, and it fits perfect at the loosest hook. in fact, this is somewhat of an update.. after wearing it throughout the day, I am now able to fasten it on the tightest hook. So yes, this material stretches. I have not washed it yet, but it should tighten up.  As it is only the material stretching. Anyway I returned the small, hasslefree. it is a nice cincher though, it gives my little frame a bit of an hourglass shape. this is definitely not for ""waiste training"", which is actually dangerous, this just nips, flattens, and hides your abdominal flaws.. while definitely adding some definition to your waist. this is very comfortable, and does remind me to sit up straight. honestly, I am afraid of warping the plastic boning. but that is good for me, as I am a huge sloucher lol.  this is absolutely perfect for posture training!!  this would by no means be acceptable to a corset connoisseur.. but for someone who wants to look good in a tight dress, this is what you need. It works much better than Spanx. I compared my spanx to this, and while the spanx was invisible under all clothing, the spanks still showed my ""pooch"", while this did not- the ""pooch"" is gone:). The boning hides tummy fat much better. Keep in mind though this is especially obvious (the boning) under certain clothing, especially tight, light colors. but it is basically invisible under tight black clothing, and it will definitely look fine under any other shirt or dresses.. given it is not skintight and nearly see-through. Other than being deceived by the ""steel boning"" claim, I am very happy. that is the sole reason I deducted stars. had they said upfront it was plastic, I would've left five stars. Great deal for $18 "
quality is ok.
Not what I expected. Wish they were more comfortable and not so wide in the calf.
THEY ARE OK COULD OF BEEN A LITTLE THICKER IT GETS A B B B B B B B B B B B  RATE
They ride up quickly and easily....
Very nice bra for a beginner but run very small. Had to return and purchase a larger size.
"As I put this shirt on for the first time, this shirt's seam tore. I'm going to hand-sew it up instead of sending it back.

The cut is flattering and the cotton is soft. It's definitely a junior's fit (hugs every curve); I ordered a size up."
"Nice skirt, needed to wash it twice to get the smell out. Also, wash with like colors! Other than that, I love it."
"I like the quality of this garment, well made and the sleeves don't go past my finger tips like so many shirts today.  However, it is ridiculously long: I'm 5' 8"" and 160lbs and this medium shirt drops past my crotch.  This is my 3rd Carhartt shirt of varying styles and this seems to be a theme with them.  I will try the small, but I think that will be too snug in the shoulder and chest."
Not true to size NB is only brand of shoes I buy these don't fit true to size
"This make up is very thick and can even appear cakey. It would be good for those who really need to cover up marks on their face. You do not need a lot in order to cover because the make-up is dense
It does not have a perfumed odor and the make-up itself is matte so it does not have a shine.
Those who want or need a heavy quality make up might like this."
"These shorts are ok- they're sort of a spandex cotton blend and have a bit of stretch. I ordered my typical size and they fit, but are tight- I think they may be junior's sizing. I would order a size up from your usual size- I usually wear a 10/12 and ordered a size large, but they're skin tight. ordered a pair of st. Eve cotton boxers from amazon at the same time and like them a lot more."
They gave me 50% money back and said the problem will be fixed by the factory. Double check before you buy cause if not fixed it is good for a girl and not a woman.
Way too small and narrow for a size 9. I usually wear an 8.5 but even these were way too small and narrow. Had to send them back.
Very comfortable and chic but stretches too much. Please ladies size down a half size.
These are not jeans as stated . They are very thin and not jean material. I am sending them back.
"I like this watch, and it's a good value for the price. It's attractive and lightweight with a good leather band. I was, however, extremely disappointed that the description said it had a date display; and there is not one! The picture of the watch did not show a date display, but I wrongly assumed the written information was accurate. I specifically wanted that feature, and that is the reason I decided to get this particular watch. Since I needed a watch for a trip I was making, I didn't have time to return it and get another. So, I  kept it. It's a nice watch, just not what I'd hoped for."
"The design is cute, but that cuteness comes at a price--it's going to bend your bills into a shallow U shape instead of keeping them flat.  I think it works better as a desktop novelty."
Cute but these are for children.
"... It runs small in the bust, if you area C cup or smaller you will be fine. Also the hem on mine did not flare out like the pic shows, it bowed in and made it look like I was wearing bloomers."
"They are nice, but the color is a little odd for me. Most of my clothing has a more neutral/earthy tone. These feel trendy. So, not my style, but they fit well (at the time I purchased them)."
I had an idea these would work well as a working glove. No. I also so thought my fingers would stay warmer if all together. No
I found this blouse on Amazon from Lotus Traders and I thought it'd be perfect for my casual wedding. It will be. It's a nice blouse but after I received it I went on the Lotus Traders website and found that if I'd bought it directly from them instead of through Amazon I would have paid $18.00 less for it.
Fits well.  Synthetic leather smell is strong and i have not worn it yet.  Airing out in the guest room.  Hopefully the strong smell will be gone soon.
Watch is smaller than expected but great otherwise.
This runs two whole x-sizes small. If you wear a 3x you will need a 5x and so forth. I am sad that I can't wear it because it is lovely. But the zipper also exploded while I was trying it on.
Went by their size chart.  It is very long in the torso and arms.  Probably needed a plus petite version.
Does not look like the picture its smaller and not full at the bottom as in the picture
Color didn't match white dress
"These shoes look cute on, and I love the color (hard to find good navy shoes)  however, they are sooo uncomfortable. I have to kick them off under my desk at the office because the criss-crossing top part of the shoe is waaaay tight and inflexible. They cut into the sides of your feet. I even put shoe stretchers in to try to make that portion wider, but they don't work. My feet are dainty as well, so these definitely won't work for someone with larger feet. It's a shame :/"
Quality shoe but sizes run too small need order a full size bigger than what you normally wear.
The quality is like a 5/0 it's very thin not like it photo bit ill wear it
"When it comes to price, I guess I cant complain. These handwarmers look cheaply made, and do not fit as snug as in the picture. Its not like I have really skinny arms or anything, but they definitely are not tight fitting as they claim in the description. I like them for what they are though, and are happy that I bought them."
Fits so large.... ordered a medium and it was way too big on me compared to over Shorts I ordered from this brand.
These are great leggings fit wonderfully but I am not sure what it is whether its the dye chemicals or what. I took them out of their packaging and the smell was unbearable.  I quickly took them in to the washer and washed them 5 times and my hands and washer smelled just like them. I would have given them a 5 star otherwise.  I ended up washing them two more times using Detergent Downey and color safe bleach to try and get rid of the smell.  I hung them up in an area where they could get a lot of air to dry each time. They still have that smell but not quite as bad. I am not sure if it will ever come out and if I can wear them.  Will try for an hour and see what happens. I am afraid to go near anyone with them on for fear of them feeling sick from the smell. It's a shame because otherwise they are great.
"This could be a delicate summer cover, but it is too tight (in the body and sleeve) and the end of the threads/seams are visible."
"These were swimming on me. They fit okay around the toes, but inches, and I mean inches too big around the ankles. I felt like if my feet were huge or swollen, they would be great, but they just looked ridiculous and made the shoe uncomfortable because nothing grabbed around the back of my foot. Unfortunately the next size down (7) was unavailable, so I couldn't try that to see if it would be any better. Too bad because they were really cute, and I love my other FitFlops (size 8)."
NOT SO COLORFUL  AND SMALL
Shorts fit fine but the material is a little too flimsy.
"I bought these to take to the hospital when I give birth to my son. Im not due for another few weeks, so I will update later on comfort and durability.

The slippers are really cute! My only problem is that they are definitely NOT true to the sizing labeled. I am normally a size 8-8.5 but find that slippers tend to be snug so i went with the large (sizes 9-11) thinking theyd be safe. My feet just barely fit. I do not see this size being comfortable for anyone bigger than a 9. There is definitely no way a size 11 would squeeze in there.

Id say definitely size up!"
Good idea but too tight on my 6 month old thighs.
Wash and machine dry well.  Good quality cotton.
Somewhat flimsy.  Not comparable to good shoes from other companies.
"Bought this on another site because they were having a sale and I'd recently gotten a different maidenform that I loved... I ordered the same size as that bra and it was way too small in the cups (band was ok).

It seems like it'd be a great bra in the right cup size, so ladies, consider ordering one cup from your usual."
Good color and fit! Only wish they had hemmed the sleeves and hem. The whipslitch just makes it look cheap.
"The same thing happened to me as the other reviewers.  I loved the boots, but one of the zippers was broken out of the box.  I am glad that I did not try another pair after reading the reviews.  If this problem could be resolved, I would love a pair of these.  The three stars would have been 5 stars if the zipper had not been broken."
Really on the small side.
"I figured that this bra would be like the white shelf bra I also bought.  However, this one has some kind of vertical supports inside the cups, which go right across my nipples...seems to take the fun out of wearing this bra."
"I read reviews saying that these ran small, so I ordered a half size up.  I'm normally an 8.5 M, or 39, and I ordered the 40.  They were still too small -- in particular, quite narrow.  I compared these size 9 to my usual Merrell Encore clogs, size 8.5, and the Spring Step were a good .5 inch shorter, and a good .5-.75 inch narrower at the widest part. My fear was that if I went up more sizes, they would still be too narrow.  My feet are a widish medium -- wide width shoes never work for me, but mediums can sometimes run narrow in the toes.  These are definitely quite narrow.  This seems odd for a clog!  It's too bad -- I like the look of these shoes.  Will be returning them."
I sent mine back. It was just ok. The fit was that of a normal t shirt and it was not soft. The arc reactor is plastic and wears on the outside. Mine was quiet and the light worked fine but just wasn't what I was looking for
its ok just extremely short
They're really long...
Ended up giving it away. Just wasn't right for me. Print was a little loud.
The reason for this purchase was because it looked cute but this is a very thin and somewhat cheap looking ring. No discoloration on my finger or the ring so far but I only wear it during the day.
"I am using these until I can find some that are more like bike shorts but for going out?
I can use these with only one tunic that I have which is more like a very short dress.
You cannot wear these alone. They are see-through."
"Didn't fit me, but pants looked fine.  I prefer a relaxed fit carpenter, but I was trying these for another color (my style is only in blue ever)."
Smaller than expected. Non slip gel on heel kind of thick.  Nicer fabric than similar one's I've purchased.
The color is a little off
"I gave 3 stars for quality,  these run very narrow and small.  Therefore, I returned ten."
"nice shoes, but found them uncomfortable, sometimes last rockport shoes i had were 8 and they fit just fine. this pair disappointed me."
"It's too small. I will have to return it, but they are very cute. I'm usually a 7 and I think I will need an 8"
"dont like the material it feels like cheap polyester easy to get dirty, don't like it gave it to my daughter. Also the color is not the same as advertised."
"Will continue to wear, and hope they ""break in"" a little for increased comfort. Overall, seem a little too pricy for the product."
"I bought BearPaw boots for my daughter because of the huge savings compared to the look-alike Uggs.  They do look the same; however, after a few weeks of consistent wear, the heels,which have a hollow interior, wore through, exposing the underside of the insole to direct contact with the ground.  If I'd known that these shoes would wear out so quickly, I might've sprung for the Uggs."
"Very nice shoe, I bought 2 size 8 which I wear they flopped on my heels, so sent back got 71/2. Still flopped on my heel,, so had to send back. I tried on a pair in tore with with same results, I think the plastic you are putting in them to keep their shape is stretching the heel out. Just my opinoion, But would love to have a pair of black and brown that didn't flop on my foot. thankyou Helen"
It bit larger than the usual US size 11. Go one size down.
Haven't worn it too much....not sure it's that comfortable.  The bottom band tends to get scrunched . Don't know how else to describe it. Maybe just have to get use to it.
Gets caught on jewelry so beware - order a size up
Nice material good for the office
It was not as cute on as it was in the photo. I'm 5'1 with a short torso. There also was no protective liner in the bottoms and had appeared to have been worn and returned. I also returned them. I really wanted to love this swimsuit.
I put them on today only to find out that the fit is smaller than expected. I ordered them within the rage given for my feet but I should have gone bigger. I like a snug fitting sock but these are really tight and thin because they are now stretched over my foot.
Runs really small. XL like a medium
I ordered my usual size and they are too long and don't fit right at all. The material is cheap. I thought I could shrink them by washing in hot water and drying on high heat. No luck. I will wear them at home. Very disappointed.
"I bought a champion sports bra a while back and it is my favorite sports bra I've ever owned so I wanted to get more of them.  When I checked through my previous purchases on Amazon it said this was the same bra, but it is definitely not.
This is a cute bra but it does NOT give you enough support to run in like the other bra does.  I'm between a 32C and a 32D so I need a lot of support.  I am pretty sure I was bouncing up a storm while WALKING so proceed with caution my large breasted sisters."
"These have held up for a couple months already, so that's a big plus for me."
"Overall the shirt is OK, bu the material is very thin... I wish it was heavier, but it works fine for working out at the gym"
"It's an attractive watch, yet it's very difficult to adjust the clasp so that the band fits your wrist properly. Once you are able to get it adjusted to fit, the fastening latch is prone to come undone while you are wearing it so the watch can fall off your arm."
One needs to order one size larger than normal for a good fit. Have not tested the pants in inclement weather yet.
"Pants are a comfortable fit - but the legs are too long for me.  I'm barely 5'7"" and my legs are a bit short, so I had to shorten them about 1 1/2 inches.  I washed the pants before wearing, but the creases from being folded were still there, so I had to iron them."
"I'm not sure about these, but I just got them before a trip so had to figure out what to pack and where.  Finally wound up using one for just undies and that worked ok.  They do help keep clean clothes separate from dirty, so that's good!"
"These were a tad short in my normal size. They seemed thick and comfortable. I returned them however, mostly because of the smell. Is that on purpose? It smelled vaguely like a gas station bathroom. They were cute on, but $70 for plastic sandals that smell weird is too much. They just look like plastic sandals. If you can get them cheaper, go for it. The smell might go away after a while? Stayed in my car after having the shoes in them in my garage overnight."
"It's a cute shirt, but it doesn't fit.  It is way to tight in the bust area."
"The snap on the coin purse part isn't always secure, and I've found change (and my husband's wedding ring, following a surgery) in the bottom of my purse.  Also, the bills compartment is very deep; maybe it's designed for larger bills than ours, but it makes getting them in and out cumbersome.  It's a nice looking piece, though, and I had already been through several worse ones when I got it, so I won't be trying again for a while."
"These socks are great in every other aspect...good fit, soft, stretchy, not too thick or thin, they even look cute. However, they pill terribly! So they don't look cute for long. Pilling on anything bothers me, it makes things old, even when the're not, and these pill after the first wear. If pilling doesn't bother you then you will probably be happy with these socks...if it does, I would look elsewhere."
"Material is nice, but the side is much too large.  It's loose, and not fitted like the photo.  I sew, and was able to make it smaller, but I would have returned it otherwise."
Very small.  Gets lost with the other charms I have on the bracelet.
"I normally wear a size 8 but the size 8s were huge on me - luckily they fit my friend's sie 9 fit perfectly, so I gave them to her. Definitely order a size up and be aware that these are very wide. However, they were extremely comfortable - I'm going to try to order a size 7 and see if those fit."
"fit as expected but I sent it back, it did not go with the dress I needed it for."
"Cute and warm. However, the size does run small. My 18 month old (25lbs) fits good in the 4t jacket except the arms are incredibly long. The sleeves actually go past the length of the jacket, unlike how the picture shows item. As per previous reviews, order ATLEAST one size larger."
"If you are looking to order theses shoes, order them a size larger than you normally wear. The shoes were very cute and I am sad the size I needed is out of stock."
padding on the heal bed makes them somewhat narrow.
"I love the shoe itself but it seems to run kind of small.  I've been wearing the same size in all of my shoes and my feet are still the same size.  If you wear a 7.5 in your usual shoe size, it is best to get a half size larger with this seller.  So next time I order, with this seller/company, I will need to order a size 8."
"This is a nice looking watch w/all the little bells and whistles.....but, it's not for me. Very light weight and small.  Can't see this one lasting long in my line of work. Casual  or formal, perfect."
It is what it says and looks great. I didn't wear it being as its huge. The picture makes it look so small. Once tied on the left over looks terribly bulky. I am not a small girl either.
"I like this dress, its really pretty and actually fits somewhat flatteringly.
But the lace part is so not-elegant and almost casual. The contrast of the silky fine skirt and the dullness of the stretchy top, its like they are from two different outfits.
I sent it back."
"works well and is really cool, made of cheap plastic but other than that a bit big on the wrist. order only if you have a large wrist. other than that its pretty cool and worth the money."
"I liked the pants; however they were way too big.  Generally,  I wear a size 8, which is usually just slightly loose. I am 5'5 and 135 + pounds, and was drowning in these jeans."
Not quite the overall padding I was expecting but the fit is comfortable.
The date on this watch didn't work.
Returned to amazon.
"I like the style of the shoe and the fold down top.  The fabric is much thinner than I expected, a sort of thin canvass. The fit is true to size but the fit around the top of the foot is tight. I wouldn't be able to wear thick socks. I was also hoping it would feel more like the Sanuk flip flops I have with the yoga mat insole but it much more firm. I'm hoping they will stretch out a bit over time because they do look pretty cool."
Put them in when I got them. Took them out to clean them a week later and the threads stripped and they won't screw together anymore.
"Vest was true to size and color was awesome! The snaps are hard to snap and unsnap. One drawback about light colors is they seem to show every spot, and the pink was no different in standing out with stains. Seller is OK, but make sure it will work for you as cost half the price to return it."
almost returned because they seem a bit large...but i was afraid the 7-7.5 would be too small  dw
Great shoe but it's cheap. It worked for my wedding but that's about all it worked for. Toe's a bit narrow on my 4E width feet so it's not bad but can't wear it very long. Great soles and memory foam!
Cute pants but order 2 sizes up. I am 5'4 140 lbs and I ordered a large. They were too small. Could get them on but couldn't button them. Should have ordered an XL. I will most likely repurchase my correct size.
"The zipper broke of after the first wash even when using a garment bag, I was rather upset. The boob compression for my HIIT/OTF workout was quite formidable but it's not worth the cost per wear."
"Liked it. I ordered a medium, in which I should needed a large size. That was my fault. But overall, doesn't scratch skin & looks good under my vintage dress. Came a bit wrinkled, though."
love the boots however I haven't even had them 2 months and the sole fell completely off the one shoe already!
"it doesnt feel it fits right but it is good product, fast delivery"
"Very nice shirt, worth the cost. Next time I will order a medium due to the need to try to shrink this one"
"Had to put some hem ribbon in the headband, but for the price, it'll work for what I'm going to use it for."
"Thinner than others I have, but colors nice. Runs small XL more like Med and sizing inconsistent in different colors."
I love the color .. Its pretty but to me it was actually tight around the ribcage. I would get a bigger size i think..
"Way too big so arch support was negligible. Had to send them back unfortunately. Attractive style, however."
I ordered these in two colors because the price was great. I wanted to wear them with skinny jeans tucked in but the jeans kept pulling out when I sat down or walked. Great shoes but not for what I bought them for. Returned.
the stones fall out
"Overall, it was an OK costume.  It was comfortable to wear.  A bit overpriced for what you get.  You can actually put it together by visiting thrift stores."
soft but not very well made.  I've already repaired seams coming apart.
"It made a cute gift. As to its quality, can't really say."
"The width is well perhaps wider than you might expect, but that is because Dunham is one of the few companies that makes shoes & boots true width & in every shoe or boot true length. That is until this pair which is like 2 sizes longer and they look and feel goofy. I take a 14 4e & my heel a d and they look like 16+ well i got mine cheap and they are for around the house and paid around $40, but had i paid much more i would have returned them."
"I love the style of this sweater, but didn't like the material it was made of and the sizing runs small.  I returned the item for a refund.  If you order it, order a size larger than you normally would."
a little cheaper looking in person but OK for a daily bag
"Cute gloves. Bows fell off immediately, though, so I had to use a safety pin."
"Totally disappointed. I own many Jambu's, but this shoe was short and also extremely wide with minimal arch support. They're cute, but that's about it- I have a suspicion that the Ambient light has something to do with the shortness-I could be wrong..."
The cap fits fine and cover all my thick hair but the elastic part that fits over the hairline leaves indents in my forehead.  I tried scooting it up a bit more the second time I used it but then it pulled on my hairline.  I didn't notice my hair being any better the couple of weeks I used it to sleep in.  I also used it one night on wet hair to see if my hair wouldn't be as gnarly as normal but it made no difference.  Sadly I cannot sleep with wet hair and have it come out looking nice the next morning.  I might use it in the winter when it gets cold.
"Fits well and cute, however the navy in the top faded onto the white giving it a dingy look. The anchor has also faded. I don't use the dryer and wash this on the delicate setting."
"This dress is very pretty and I've received a lot of compliments. I like how it fits, but the material is very thin and would probably be see through without the print. But definitely well worth what you pay for it."
My brown tee got holes and food spots wouldn't come out
"I have had this winder for about a week now and i really like it.  It is quiet enough to keep in my bedroom.  Turns gently in either direction, not a swinging motion.  I settled on frequency setting B (A, B, C, D are the options, basically A is lowest amount of winding minutes per hour , B is slightly more, C is more and D is most. I chose the automatic setting for direction. This keeps the time accurate without over-winding my watches.

I have a large (44mm) Hamilton X-Wind with a traditional leather band and an IWC Portuguese (42mm) with a deployment clasp.

I recommend this product.

1/12/2015 update: I sadly will be retuning this watch winder as the Hamilton X-Wind is too large for this winder.  The plastic puck that you strap your watch to is unable to seat properly into the winder, so it pops and snaps on each rotation.  This is too loud for bedroom use, which is where I have my winder.  This unit worked perfectly for my slimer/lighter IWC.  Again, this winder is not for large/bulky/heavy watches similar to a Hamilton X-Wind."
"Light weight, not much structure."
"I will be returning these because they slip on EVERYTHING, and I can't be slipping and sliding everywhere I go.  On the plus side, they fit very nicely, and are super light weight.  I added an insole to give more support.  I'm just disappointed in the slippery sole."
"Doesn't have as much room as expected. If change pocket is full, phone doesn't fit."
Product is OK.  Have used it for a few months - but zipper now broken and must be replaced.  Be sure not to add too much content as the zipper will tear.  Fairly compact (as I don't like to carry big wallets in my front pocket).
"I got these primarily for travel (Europe in a week, but just in general)--something that wasn't a touristy sneaker but that had some support still. I  bought them in store and they were my first pair of Clarks.

They're solid shoes but, after wearing them all weekend--the salesperson said they came with a 30-day guarantee and I could wear them outside, get them dirty, etc. and still return them--I am indeed returning them.

My first instinct about these was that they looked too much like hiking boots and also looked heavy, and I wish I had listened to my instinct because both are true! They felt comfy in the store but even after a short walk with my dog later that day, I realized the insoles weren't very cushioned at all and there is little to no arch support (I have slightly high arches but nothing serious--I don't wear orthodics or have a foot condition or anything). I asked the sales guy about insoles and he said you can put your own in, but that changes the support/wave motion of the shoe. Well, there's no way the insoles are cushioned or supportive enough for me, so I'd definitely have to put my own insoles in. Then, there is the stiffness and heaviness. I like that they're durable and waterproof but it's at the cost of feeling like a hiking shoe (not uncomfortable in the sense of blisters but just not something your feet would enjoy being in all day). They're also very heavy--while walking my dog, I could hear the shoes thudding on the pavement. For travel, I want a shoe that's light enough to pack and also to wear all day. I don't want a hiking boot that makes me stomp around and makes my foot feel imprisoned and stiff.

Even style-wise, I'm less happy with these the more I look at them. As I said, they look rugged and utilitarian. I'm all about comfort over style, but for this much money, I don't want to look like I'm going camping when I'm out exploring European cities. I got them in gray which is a nice color but they still looked very hiking boots-ish. It's nice they come with two different colors of shoelace but still (btw, only certain colors come with two shoelaces).

I will say that these seem well-constructed and Clarks' return policy for these is excellent--not sure if it applies on Amazon, so consider buying these in the store. My main complaint about these is the insole/cushioning. I don't have freakishly high arches or anything, but I do need support, and these have almost none. I could put arch supports on top of the insoles like some reviewers did, but I tried that and it felt bulky--plus, if I'm going to basically re-do the entire cushioning system of the insole, why spend all this money. I have sneakers and even hiking boots already at home--I got these because the ""wave technology"" was supposed to have cushioning and support and be easy on your feet while walking. These are actually less supportive than my sneakers or my hiking boots and have almost no cushioning. They may work for you if you need minimal cushioning and don't need arch support--otherwise, you will probably be buying your own insoles--and at that point, why bother with these expensive shoes? Might as well buy a solid mid-range pair with decent construction and then get your own insoles if needed.

it's also worth noting, as other reviewers have said, that these aren't true hiking/trek sneakers (not enough ankle support for serious hiking). So if you're looking for something that can work in cities and ""off road,"" maybe look for a more dedicated hiking boot.

Clarks seems to be high quality but these shoes are too uncomfortable, stiff, and unsupportive to keep for me."
"Thin and light. Any thinner and it would be sheer see-through. Good top for hot sunny weather or as a base layer in cooler climates. I live in Florida where  the sun sizzles any bare skin. This provides SPF 25 which is at least some arm protection and handles moisture far better than any cotton tee. Sleeves are way too long. Perhaps they are cut so one can hold them down while applying a 2nd long sleeved garment, or they are designed to cuff over a second top. Hard to say. Also, the torso length is about an inch shorter than an average tee. Kind of a strange fit. If you wear in tucked in it easily pulls out and if you wear it outer it rides up to expose your middle when you bend over. I have to cuff up the sleeves about 3 inches. I think this model is being phased out and we're seeing the last of what colors and sizes are left. I believe there is a newer version of this top that perhaps doesn't have these flaws. Also, it's priced a little high for a close-out product, if that's what this is."
"Really cute. I had to reshape the underwire/bra area, and fabric was a lil lopsided, adjusting tightness on one shoulder strap helped. A bit over priced"
I wish they were more assorted instead of similar colors and patterns.
Was disappointed that these shoes ran wide. They flop up and down on my heels. I would not be able to walk any distance in these but they are cute for wearing just sitting around.
"This may be an unfair review. The skirt is pretty. It is just so long, which, if you are tall is probably good news. The thing that I didn't like was how wrinkled the fabric was. I could just see myself spending an hour ironing this skirt and burning the material. Otherwise, the colors are beautiful."
"Meh! I would rather save up and buy the real deal, as that one lasts longer."
"Ordered the ""ballet pink color at it was salmon pink. It fit as expected though."
"Socks are good quality, just somewhat small"
"Similar to drugstore sunglasses, though maybe with better UV protection. The plastic feels cheap, the fit is so-so, and the temples/earpieces are uncomfortable. Without nose-pads, they also slide down my face.

They may be ""large"" versus children's or women's glasses, but wearing them, I had large gaps to the sides, and smaller gaps at the top. Much worse coverage than wrap-around sunglasses. The temples/earpieces sit poorly: a little tight, and not very comfortably. And they look awkward on my oblong/largish male face. Not good since the look I'm going for isn't usually ""those aren't really your sunglasses, are they? and they look cheap"".

Objectively, they are not terrible for the price in terms of UV protection and materials. But also, they are not very comfortable, and decidedly unflattering for my facial structure-- not something I'm likely to wear, so back they go.

I only award 3 stars because they're 10 bucks and have good UV protection (and a carry-bag), cheaper than most of what I could get at local B&M. Recommended only if you have a small/round (probably female) face."
"The ears were floppy & the belt was way to small, other than that the dress fit"
Three stars!!!material very comfortable but material a bit thin..
"The color is just not nice. Ordered the ""Vintage Black"" which is really an ugly grey."
Purchased as gift. Receiver doesn't like style. Returned
"I wear XXL in almost all of my jackets, especially work gear. This fits like a XXXL. Besides having to exchange it for a smaller size, its a nice jacket."
"i got in black. i am not sure how much i like the added design in the back.
i love my plain navy pair."
The material is stretch and it fit perfectly. The front collar is too low not as is showing in the picture.
It was good. As expected
Wig was a decent buy for the price. The bangs were too much though and I kept finding blue strands all over my clothes through the night. So not a great wig but worth buying for a one night party if you don't want to spend a lot of money.
"Cap was somewhat large and odd shaped, as a result of fit. Expected it it be more form fitting. Got it in black. I guess those with lots of hair would like the fit."
Ordered the 4x and they ran a bit small
"From afar it looks great, I have a fair amount of compliments from people.  The problem I see is that I use it as a real workout watch, and the material is a bit too thin for my taste, it felt like it digs into my skin some. For the price, I cannot complain. if you are using it as a fashion piece, by all means, but before this I had a Motosports with a good quality silicon band, and it never felt like it digs into my wrist."
I like the design the design of the pants and that they are stretchy.  They material is somewhat thin which I do not mind too much but I tend to overheat when at work. With 12hr shifts.....that is not good.  It's almost like parachute material.  I do not recommend if you are prone to overheating.  They wash well and haven't faded.
I ordered this and one of the emeralds as well. I love the emerald but this one came mounted differently than pictured with the necklace hanger on the flat side instead of the corner. Additionally the hanger came bent (easily fixed but still). The gem quality is amazing however for the price
"Very flattering and sexy, the pouch is a little on the small side, but then again most of them are.."
"Had to return due to sizing issues. The cups were too big and made my chest look odd, and the whole thing was a little short. Also didn't hold my tummy in as well as I had hoped. Would likely work quite well for someone thinner with just a little mommy belly to smooth out."
Shirt was great..... until I washed it and it shrunk.  Wash and dry with caution.
"They live up to their name.....to hot for me.  I gave them to my cousin.  She loves them with her boots.  We live in mid-Michigan where the winters are cold.  Being college students, we do a lot of campus walking.  They keep here feet toasty."
"It's ok, probably better for kids though."
Its ok if you want a nice looking watch for cheap that looks good from a distance then you sir will be happy with it. But fair warning won't last long it is a fragile skeleton.
"it's too large for my taste, sorry"
Didn't realize they were wide calf!:(
"Very 1928s. Beautifully designed and presented. Only regret that I chose the brass colour. I think gold-coloured would have been preferable. Nevertheless, am very pleased with ""lorngette"" look. The fact that it actually magnifies makes it useful as well as ornamental. JB"
I really like most everything about this back pack.  Pockets are great and the size is perfect.  I bought it to hang on my daughters wheel chair. ..it now holds medications. .extra g tube and syringes...backup  adult diaper...vinyl  gloves...gauze and her American  Girl  doll....and wallet.  HOWEVER.....she picked the. Blue backpack  and it has a TERRIBLE ODOR!!!!!  I have kept it outside hopping the odor would decipate but it hasn't  at all.  I even sprayed febreeze on it to no avail.  Not sure if I'm going to purchase another one...but not the same one...she loves the Color but when you walk in her room the smell of the back pack hits you...then I wonder if it's even safe to have in her room.
Sides a little high and rubbed the side bone of foot
"It runs small, but it's stretchy. The waffle weave is a little rougher than I'd like, and after 6 months it developed one small hole, but overall, not a terrible shirt. The collar is prone to flipping up at the corners, which is kind of a annoying.

I like the cut and fit, but I hoped for better material and construction."
"It was a pretty ring. I think for the price it was really nice. However, it made my finger turn green :("
"While I am going to keep this hoodie, I am a disappointed by the cut and cost. The wool material is very nice, but for almost $200 the design is sloppy and unimpressive. It is very very heavy, and warm, but not as warm as the 5 star reviews make it seem.  Comfortable and cozy around the house. Good as a heavy base layer, but not really all that."
"I remember wearing Sbiccas years and years ago and thought they were so comfy.  These, while soft, have almost no cushioning in the footbed.  If I hadn't gotten them so cheap, I would have sent them back."
I like it but too small...I ordered an xlarge and this looks like a top on me and I need leggings or something on under if I don't want my business to show!
"The size is perfect, but the material is really thin/light/flimsy. I like the 3 clasps on the back, but again, the material covering the cups is pretty thin. It gives my boobs a cone shape appearance."
these are well padded and initially you think they fit like a dream.  couple hours later not so much.  I'd say they run a bit short but if I had ordered 8 they would have slipped up and down on heel.  Thought inserts designed to keep foot from pushing against toe of high heels would work but it doesn't because it makes the toe area fit too tight.  I still love the shoe but am careful to wear it only for those occasions when a couple hours is all I need.
"The watch works as a real cellphone (without any smartphone).
This was the main reason I was looking for such a watch/cell-phone.
Unlike expensive iWatch which needs expensive iPhone this one can perform as stand alone cell phone.
And the price is unbelievable ($36 right now on Amazon).
I inserted my T-Mobile SIM card from existing phone and the watch immediately started working as cell phone without any extra settings.
I did cut T-Mobile standard SIM card to the size of micro SIM to fit into the watch (to do so I searched the web for SIM cutting template, printed it and cut my card to the proper size).
It was also easy to connect the watch to my car BlueTooth handsfree system.
Using if for more than a month and pretty happy with it.
The 4-star rating (I would give 4.5-star if possible) is due to battery life.
You should charge the battery every day even if you do not talk on the phone.
But it is still better then iWatch, you don't have to charge it every 8 hours.

UPDATE #1 as of Nov 18, 2015.
After 3 months of use the watch's plastic wrist strap has broken and there is no way to repair or replace it.
I am not going to reduce the ratings of the product as the watch/phone performs very well,
what I will do is I will buy the same or similar product in metal case and with metal wrist strap.

UPDATE #2 as of June 30, 2016.
My 2nd watch's plastic wrist strap has broken and there is no way to repair or replace it.
I am reducing the ratings of this product and I am not going to buy it again.
I recently bought similar replacement watch in metal case and with metal wrist strap, it also works as cell phone with SIM."
"Bought this 'cause I like Analog watches and the Casio brand, and wanted a retro-look brown case with white face. However, as a previous poster noted, it is way too complicated. I pride myself on setting up any of the 5 or so  Casio watches I've owned without using the manual, but not this one!

Also, I don't like the velcro band as it looks cheap, but some people may not agree. Also, the light function is not a good as other Casio watches."
Excelent . good. I loved...
"They are big and oversized. For the price, they are a great price.  I'm only giving three stars because they scratched themselves.  I keep these in their protective fabric cinch sack and when I took them out for the first time, the end of the stems had scratched the inside of the lenses. I consider that a design flaw. When folded up the stems should not make contact with the insides of the lenses. In this case they do.. and the vibrations of being in a pouch on a motorcycle were enough to scratch."
"works for playing disc golf, keeps tics off legs!"
"Made in Canada, the leather seems to be good quality - it's thick, yet flexible. Love the clunky buckle. Thanks to other reviewers, I ordered two sizes up [I wear 32"", but got 36""], and I agree that's the best idea -- a 34"" would have ""worked"" for me, but the extra length is comfortable, and the tab looks better. Actually, I'm surprised at how much a 2"" belt [instead of 1-1/2""] improves the fit - and the appearance! - of my 501s. Highly recommended!
14 Dec 2016: This is a follow-up to my original review, which WAS five stars. I wear this belt nearly every day, and it shows practically no sign of damage of any sort around the holes. It's thick yet flexible, and has remained black. HOWEVER, my husband just ordered one, and it is notably thinner, and has a shiny finish instead of matte. He's not sending it back, but the pronounced deterioration of quality is disappointing.

""TOXIC"" is a NON-PROBLEM: I used to live in California, so I know that the toxic warning label is a by-product of CA's *extreme* PC attitude. The simple act of curing leather with chemicals means it gets a sticker. All kinds of stuff gets needlessly tagged, even gas pumps [are you stopping driving?] and everybody knows it's nuts. Do you really think you are going to contract cancer from a belt!? Ill-informed paranoia, not to say ridiculous."
"I misread evidently and thought it was top and bottom, but it is just the top.  That was my mistake.  But i wear 12s and this 12 was terribly tight and i will need to return it!!!!  If you order, you may consider ordering a larger size.  I think though that it is a nice piece, if it only fit ...."
They were nice but too large where they would slide off my Face.
Good quality. However I had ordered the black one with red logo whereas the one I received was black on black.
Pilled up after 2 wears. Not happy with quality of this product. It is lightweight and comfortable.
"It shrunk a little after washing and it gets a little wrinkley, but it's cute."
"dress is even prettier in person. sexy, but appropriate for work function, too.  the 6 is a little small for me but an 8 would be humongous. sadly, it will go back."
the torso was short so it was like a 2 piece or a skirt that was wayyyyyyy too short
"These shoes are SUPER cute, however are a full size too large. My daughter is age 4, wears a size 12 shoe and these won't fit her until this coming winter. She wants to wear them so bad (has even tried) but they slip off her heels so bad and leave blisters because they are still too big. I would recommend ordering them a full size smaller than your child currently needs."
"Got this for my 16 yr old brother, he thought it was rad, but it is super big and no way to adjust it."
"After three babies in five years, there's a little bit of squish to my middle. I was hoping these would help slim down my mid section, but all they really did was smush my muffin top just a little bit higher up, lol. They are high rise, but they don't really help offer much help for me in terms of slimming abilities for me presonally.

They were comfortable enough, but the compression and height of the high rise brief just made my mushy middle more pronounced where the brief stopped."
"High quality boot, but very very loose in the entire shaft area. Maybe that's the style, but make it look like I was wearing a piece of armor, especially with the over the knee part sticking up and super stiff. Absolutely ridiculous looking, but maybe I just hav.e the wrong body type (I'm 5'2'', calf circumference widest point is 13.5"", got the 5.5)."
"She loved it, silver is already wearing off"
"I like the fit of this bra, great support but material is scratchy.  Will try washing to see if this helps."
"Fit was kind of weird, sat and cut kinda high in the front making it look like I had granny panties however my bf liked the lace and the opening proved to be quite convenient"
Had to return the item since the top seam of plastic boot bottom to fabric upper pressed onto my wife's big toe joint making the boot unwearable.  A longer boot would not solve the problem. Chose another brand without this design configuration.
"The swimsuit is very cute, but it runs very small. So we ended up giving it to my little niece."
"I love Clarks shoes.  Usually I wear the clogs (which are sooooo comfortable).  I immediately tried the Maggilyn shoe on when I received them, but the springy comfort was not there.  The Maggilyn is the Bendable style.  Sorry, but I had to return them. The size seemed to be right on.  I ordered my normal size 9 medium."
They're ok but not for me.  The toe area is very tight.  I can't wear them. They aren't attractive  either.  They have to go back.
"Just received these today, delivered to my front door.  (I love Amazon) - I  ordered a half size larger as I hate having my toes scrunched when I walk.  I purchased my regular size in Keen's and can't even wear them anymore because I've been dealing with scrunched toes for a year.  I had to find a new pair of shoes - we've had such a mild winter in Colorado  (western slope) that I was even wearing my Oofas with socks just so my feet would be comfy.  But I do not recommend flip flops all the time.  It's not practical.  Even for Colorado'ans.  OK - the shoe fits great.  Just as I suspected.  I read the reviews and everyone has said to order a half to full size larger.  Since I'm female ordering mens, I went with the half size larger.  And I'm glad I did.  I wouldn't say there's superior arch support but there is arch support, and it fits my size 10 (womens) foot perfectly in a mens size 9.  The foot width is perfect.  I thought my toes may feel squeezed because they do appear narrow to the eye, but they're not.  Must be the cosmetic designing.  They're a cool looking shoe.

I will update this review again after wearing this shoe out and about  for a few days."
"The comfort of these boots and the style are wonderful.
The problem is with the lingering odor.
When I received them I could not believe the terrible smell inside and outside of the boots.
Sort of like a chemical smell.  I went online and found some cleaning tips. Fabreeze, newspaper inside, etc.
It took days to even lessen the smell. I probably would not order from this vendor again."
Its very hard to get in and out of but it works
This shirt I thought was really cute. My husband loved it but once I washed it (I didn't dry it) the logo cracked!! So sad.
Still has a low rise. The elastic waist is sufficient.
"These worked okay, but still a little small for a tall, plus size woman."
"We ordered the 6 month size, which says it's for babies 10-18 pounds. Our baby wears size 3-6 normally, and he weighs just under 14 pounds. He's in the 8th to 10th percentile all around proportionately (as in, not chunky legs or waist, he's actually rather petite for his age). But, this  swim diaper can barely be buttoned on him. It's too late for me to order a bigger size, as we need it for swim lessons this weekend, and the swim school requires a reusable swim diaper over a disposal one. I'm quite disappointed."
"A nice boot. Fits slightly smaller than other size 13 shoes I own, but good if on sale when I wear thin socks. My wife doesn't really like them, though. She thinks they are ugly."
"these xw saucony shoes were very narrow, as soon as I put them on my 3 year old's feet he said ""shoes hurt"".. back to the drawing board for an xw shoe. too bad they don't make the saucony kineta in little kid or big kid sizes, they were his favorite, I was hoping these would be a comparable replacement but they are way too narrow."
Really beautiful  but both charms fell of right
"The shoes are well made and very comfy. However, as far as appearance, they did not look dressy enough for me, so I returned them.  I then bought the Ecco Flash T-Strap, which fit my needs."
Great shoe and is great to combine with basically everything
"If this wallet had a coin purse at the back, it would have been absolutely perfect."
I have a narrow foot and these were still a little tight across my toes.
This is the smallest 3 X 4 X I have ever seen. I ended up giving it to my sister and it fit her perfectly. She wears a size 12! The quality of the dress is good. It looks great but it's way way too small .
"Had to wash first, son said they were itchy...all better now"
"I returned it because online and other girls, it looked cute but on me it made me frumpy.
It was tight around the chest area, im 36D, so beware.
The flowers weren't as vivid but the green was nice.
The dress hit a little above my ankles, im 5'7"
"Difficult time pulling up the side zipper. It would advance to waist and then get stuck. It would slide up fairly easily when off, but not while attempting to wear the dress. After MANY attempts and frustration, it finally went up. The overall fit was nice, love the skirt, but the padding on the chest and the way it was draped was not flattering to my figure. Returned the dress and attempting a different style."
Too heavy .... Stiff . But well made
Beautiful dress but sized all wrong
"Buy one to two sizes up, these shrink very quickly"
meh. Nothing special.
I was hoping that the material would be 50% cotton and 50% polyester as that is what was recommended for the decals.  The weight is good and the item was well packaged.  Came a little later than I expected but this may be due to the Christmas rush and the post office was understaffed and quite busy.  I would have no problem recommending this company to family or friends but would suggest that they find out just what the material was before buying to be sure it was what they needed.
Not a good fit.  Ordered size 7...usually wear a 6 1/2.  Legs were huge.
"I used to have another Bloch shrug which fitted perfectly and had very long sleeves with thumb holes. I used to wear it in ballet class, but also with dresses / tops during the day. This shrug is ok for ballet class, but too large to wear with a dress. The sleeves are on the short side, and I am only 5'7""."
"Dickies shirts are almost always sized smaller. I bought an XL when I normally wear large and the shirt barely fits as a large. However, it is a good looking shirt."
This is a pretty case but rather flimsy.  The case closes well but the inside is not well made and doesn't hold the cards firmly.  I thought it would be made of metal but it seems to be made of plastic.
I ordered this two sizes larger than normal based on the reviews. It's still a bit tight on the boyfriend but not to bad. If your looking for a loose fit id go three sizes up.
It's okay. A little cheaply made.
"Thought the fit and style are as expected, the fabric is far too thin and rather see-through. We bought this ""Romeo & Juliet"" night gown for a stage play but it's so thin the girl has to wear a slip under it and it will not stand up to much use or washing."
The style is very cute.  I love the purple.  The shoe is a little wide on my feet as most shoes are.  The bottoms are very stiff. It would be nice if they were more flexible.  The shoes also make noise when I walk.  I would have given a higher rating if it wasn't for the noise while walking.
Beautiful dress! Looks exactly as pictured but WAY too small
"Ordered for my daughter size XL, it fits but its kind of clingy. Not the loose fit I was hoping for. Material is very thin. Will make a nice house dress."
"Although I liked the fit of this FitFlop, I have returned it and will rethink my choice.  The design of the shoe was just a little too much for me.  I thought the flower accent would be cute, but for me.....it was oversized and seemed to cover a good portion of my foot.  The sizing was right on target and the comfort was good, so I may do another search and try a different color/style."
"Not as well made as the original Dozier model.  Also, lacks arch support and sufficient padding in heel and sole for those of us with extra sensitive foot tissue."
I returned these but wanted to keep them.  These shoes were comfortable but the straps are made of a stretchy material and my foot would've been slopping around in the shoe before too long.  Very cute for the price.
"Was hopeful but these snag easy and the butt area is really see-through. You can even see the tag through the material in the back when standing. ..not even bent over. Great tummy control, not much leg shaping either.  I like mine really snug in the thighs. I also notice some shirts stick to them. I hate when shirts crumple up in the crotch area when you walk. Even with that being said they are nice for the price with the right outfit"
"These do run small, but a good shoe for the price."
"This cardigan would have been nice had it been smaller and more fitted. I just decided to return it, even though it goes back to the UK."
"This outfit is really cute and I love the kimono look. The fabric and quality is great. It's more of a cream and sage color. The strange thing about this is how high the sides go up on the hips. The length and fit was correct on my baby, but the sides of the hips were so high that you could see above his diaper straps when you caught a side view of him. It looks like the cut of a Jane Fonda leotard. Strange."
The previous version were much better these feel cheaper.
"Very cute! However I had to have alterations done.  The chest and shoulder area runs really big. Luckily my friend is an excellent seamstress and she took it in quite a bit for me. (I'm a 36-38 DDD and it was falling off my shoulders!) All being said and done, it turned out great in the end and I met a few big bad wolves."
"Very cute outfit,  however EXTREMELY too small!! I ordered an XL, and I'm usually a small-medium in clothing. It was very tight, with zero extra room. I do like my clothes tight-fitting but this was just too small. I am 5'5 137 lbs. I need a XXL in this outfit!!! I've never worn a 2xl in my life! Clearly these are not American sizes, which I already knew but did not think it was THIS different in sizing! I would suggest order at least 2 sizes up, or in my case 3 sizes up!"
My husband enjoyed the look of this boot and was excited about wearing them in the snow but after trying them on the grommets/eyelets snagged at the shoe laces and caused them to fray. The inside of the boot is a soft fluffy material that started flaking off and caused his black pants to have white spots all over. :/ So we returned them and are on the lookout for another nice boot to wear in the snow.
The little rubber things that hold the glasses on your nose fell off pretty quickly.
"Although these shorts have a great appearance, the inside netting that forms the underwear portion of the swimsuit, is too small.  Design flaw"
Smaller and tighter than expected.
"I was a bit disappointed when I got these. Was so excited to see they shipped so fast. Just to find out, when I tried them on. My toes hit the top of the boot. Which I don't like that. Especially in boots. If I was a person who wore my shoes to just fit. I would have ordered differently. I've never had a problem with this style boot. Until now. So just beware that they are small fitting."
It is beautiful except the belt is yellow and that part is not dressy at all.  I wish they used a gold-tone belt instead of bright yellow.
I wasn't impressed. It was baggy around the chest area and tight around the waist.
"It was cheaper than what I usually pay for a backpack but my daughter loves the Lion Guard and when I found Fuly and in pink, I had to get it.  The first week of school the mess on the side came off of the bag.  A little disappointed it didn't make it any longer but for the price I paid, the inside is still good."
This bra does not offer the support I was looking for.  Okay for smaller size cups
"It looks great, but the quality doesn't match the price. One of the snaps broke off when I took it off the first time. It's an easy fix, but I expected something with better quality."
"It's black and tan (not white or off white). So, it can only worn with black.

It's not heavy or large but fairly light and doesn't close in front even (as one might do when feeling a cold wind) when pulled together-and a ordered a larger size than normal. I wouldn't order it again."
If you want this dress to fit as short as it does on the model and you are 5.2 or shorter it is not going to work.  I am 5.1 and it came close to my knees.
"Ok you guys, you have to realize that these look like gas station glasses. If you are ok with that then these are awesome."
"OK, so yes it's very inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. Cute and it was OK for a party prop."
"Really thin. The top material (the netting/tulle) is pretty scratchy. Got to wear this under my wedding dress and it's too thin - won't hold up to the weight of the dress - and uncomfortable. Fits well in the waist, though. The tulle/netting at the bottom ruffle is soft, a different material. Returned.

Also - it comes in a Halloween Costume package!"
"A very good friend narrates books for Audible so I bought this to highlight some of her bestsellers (in the photo area.) It was a birthday present and before I was able to get the tote to her, the inside started cracking.  I was so disappointed.  I have to give her the gift since so much went into the planning but I was not happy about it."
Material deteriorates easily
Too small of a face for me but i still wear it on occasion.
shoe was ok . one shoe had discoloration compared to the other one. but other wise ok.
Little bulky with my boots but i like them they're cute and fit fine
I ordered this one because I could not find a lengthy cotton one for the summer. It serves its purpose. I was not happy with price but it is all I could find at that time.
"I love the jacket. Good material. Cute seams. Just too big. I followed other reviews and bought a size up and it's huge.
I normally wear a size L or XL. I bought 2 XL.
I am 5 ft tall 160 lbs. Large chested. Thin through thigh area. I'm going to take it in my self. I have a sewing machine."
"Really sexy but they run small, I got large and it fit like a small"
"Great, thought it would be a little longer and more of a trench coat than a zip up hoodie. Still cute though"
Size ran a little small for me.. I wear thicker socks and they are a little small unless I wear thin cheap socks
Good quality but hard for me to get past the ankle with a sturdy sock on.
The shirt fits loosely which is great for chubby people.  It soaks in sweat well and is great for active sports.  Just choose a color that you won't regret.
"I've found the Anita nursing bras to be a good balance of price and quality, but this one is not my favorite. It is true to size and fairly comfortable, but it fits oddly. Which makes my shape odd. The shoulder straps are also very far apart and felt like they were falling off. I have a small ribcage and large chest, so this might work fine for someone with different proportions, but it sure doesn't work for me. It's going back."
nice but a bit small. I ended up returning it
Would been a good pair of pant if the legs weren't like bell bottoms.  The picture is deceiving.
I LOVE my Gel KINZEI 4's....time for new pair so ordered the 5's- they are half size smaller. My big toe rubbed the end. My advise order 1/2 size up. I have had several Asics and this will be first time I've had to do this!
They are very comfortable but the pad for memory foam is a little short. Not worth sending back for.
These were smaller than I expected.
pinched the balls of my feet
"I love MBJ fabric.  Love.  However, the picture is very deceiving.  The shirt is actually quite short.  I am 5'5"" and it hits me right at my waistline.  Wish it were about 3 inches longer."
Should get a size bigger then your foot.
These shrink very easily and ball up!
"Bought this as a gift for my dad's girlfriend.she loves it, it's pretty good size too"
This dress is great and I love how heavy the fabric is.  Unfortunately there is a spot that is lighter than the rest of the fabric right above my belly button.
Would like to exchange for medium but don't know how.
"I ordered the Clear/Purple/Pink/Blue/Black assortment.  Upon receipt, in lousy light, it appeared that I received 2 white and 3 black.  Went right out to the deck to check them more in natural light, and this is what I see:
-the pink looks more milky white with a light hue of pink
-the purple looks more black, not even close to the amethyst color expected
Financially not worth it to return them, at the special price I ordered them at; would cost probably half the amount just to ship them back.
Kind of disappointed, but they'll work."
"The fabric is comfortable  and stays put. My issue is that I wear a crew neck when I want it visible (unlike a v neck). The neck line isn't as nice as it was when it first arrived. I've washed it around 6 times and I suspect it will continue to degrade. I might try a Tommy John one next (their underwear is superb, so their shirts might be, as well...just very expensive)"
"Looks like ""pleather"" but is actually a shiny fabric. Aside from that it fits well for the price and I will definitely wear it."
button color is Not favorable
"I must have gotten the wrong impression but this isn't a shirt - it's a dress!  But it's too short to be a regular dress, so maybe it's a shirt?  I'm confused. Too much trouble to return.  Oh, well..."
"Too bad. Would of been 5 star, but the sizing is really kinda off. I'm 5'9"", 25""/26"" waist. These pajama pants in my usual size Small turned out to be too baggy(especially on the waist) for me. And what I can't believe is, it's too long for me too. I had to check carefully if I got the wrong size, but no, it clearly says size Small on the tag. I would of exchanged it, but there is no XS size option. I decided to keep it to complete my pajama set because I really like the top, and I like the material and the comfort of them."
"I prefer pants/ jeans that sit low on the hips, but these were just a tiny bit too low resulting in a muffin top. Just not flattering on me, maybe more for someone with a slim middle section/ different body shape.... I did love the material and was sad to send them back."
"O.k. ring that is fairly attractive, delicate and well-made, even though it wasn't really what I expected. Still, a great purchase overall."
Made weird bulges.
"I wish I could rate it better but honestly I expected a better quality.  Maybe I should have just paid more if I expected more.  Otherwise, it's ok.  I noticed it run just a littel small."
"If you are the only one using these, they might be great for you. Unfortunately, they were a bit flimsy for use as part of a kid's costume. I fixed them once during the run of the show, and they are sitting with props needing repair now. They look good. If you only need them for one night or you'll be careful, they could be perfect, but if you are hard on things, then I'd look for something less delicate."
"Okay, needed some warm long sleeves. These fit huge! Toddler wears mostly 18 month - 24 months  and these are huge on her. Sleeves too long, and snap area hangs down off her. Should fit in the next year or so. Other than size issue the quality is just okay, a few snaps are already coming off."
They're ok but definitely not super comfortable
this is a little bit loose. will look great on someone with a curvy body
"Nice, but they are a bit heavy for me. My ear was sore from the weight so I doubt I'll wear them often."
"I don't know what is happening lately with Amazon, but they are saying in my orders for ex that this item was delivered Tuesday and actually it arrived 2 days later (Thurday). I don't like this because i am a prime client and i choose express prime items, because i want them delivered in 2 days, else i would buy the same item cheaper and arriving when they want. It is not the only time that happened this.
The boxers have very nice texture, cotton, alive color and they look comfy. I will add later my husband's opinion."
The metal part broke after first wash.
Love the style. Runs a tad small. Suprised that there is literally no lining or weight to it. Not at all for warmth a jacket for looks and layering.
"Be warned... they are very difficult to put in your ear by your self. Very small, very hard to close the circle properly. They are exactly what I wanted but very hard to put in."
"These things are huge. I have a 34 waist, and ordered the medium, and these balloon out all over the place."
Fist these boots do not reach anywhere near my knees. I'm 5'10. Then the right shoes is tight at the ball of the foot. They also get hot inside. Otherwise the height and sole are good.
My son reports that these are slightly snug. His significant other says they look good.
"Decent shirt for the price, kind of sloppy looking. The material is thin and rayon. You must wear a nude or white bra underneath or the color will show through (this is for the white shirt). Fit as expected. My daughter needed a white shirt for a band concert. That's about all it will be used for. And even though it's rayon, it DOES wrinkle."
odd waistband
"my bag was a little smaller  than the image.  The straps are different.  They are not as wide, and they're shiny. They make the bag look cheaper. Also, it did not come with a coin purse.  I thought I could use the coin purse from a  Baggallini bag I already have, but this one didn't even have the tether to attach the coin purse.  I'm so disappointed.  I needed the bag right away, so I can't even send it back."
"the product works ok,,,i expected a more brilliant shine......"
"Very nice outfit, fun and provocative, but runs 2 sizes too small"
"Doesn't seem to minimize at all, and it only has a 2-hook clasp, rather than the 3-hook pictured. I specifically chose this bra because I thought it had 3 hook and eyes, and so I'm disappointed."
"The Medium size is too big , but the quality is good"
they weren't what I expected the designs aren't even the same they are just plain and so of them have weird stuff on them
amazing product sad it was a little small but gave it to a relative
"Too small.
L is equal M slim fit."
Pretty snug for a medium and I don't like how the pointed part of the collar does not lie down flat on the front of the jacket.  Ended up not liking how it looked on and gave it to my 22 yr old daughter.  She doesn't mind that it looks that way.
no padding at all
"Got this outfit for the Halo fanatic at home for Halloween, and this is close enough.  The helmet is in two piece that your supposed to put together and it works well for those with giant heads. Won't hold up to excessive play like most cheaper costumes but considering it was $20 compared to the $40 or so dollars for a full Halo gear, it was great."
"The shoe is Cute and fairly comfortable. They run a tad short. I am breaking them in or they are breaking my feet in...not sure which yet. Won't be walking any long distances in these, but will be fine for going out.  Love the yellow!"
Love these. But not to long after having them the material of the straps started to separate. The leather or pleather from the inside material.
"These scrubs are VERY soft and comfortable. I love the pants but unfortunately they were too large for me. I am 100 Ibs and 5 feet tall and they were too large around the waist, legs and they were too long for my height. I ordered an XXS. I wish they would have fit because they were very comfortable."
"Not for 12+ size, but I can tell they would have been nice for the winter."
"Very tight around the hips, and I'm only 125, 5'5. Its more of a body-con dress."
"I have regular width calves and have never had trouble fitting them into boots of any kind, but these were slightly too tight, even when I extended the top as far as possible. I would not recommend these for people with wide calves. I ended up giving them to my sister and buying a different pair of boots for myself."
"It is nice, but it did shrink a bit after a couple of washes. Maybe dry it hanging and not in the dryer."
"very comfy, but the material on the top of your foot is really soft and pliable.  It would be easy to trip or slip in these.  Love Crocs, but trying another style.  Not stiff enough for me."
"I bought these for my son to wear to school when he starts wearing snow boots, that way he won't be using these outside.  He wore them twice and they already look like crap.  He must have went out to recess with them on.  Ugh!  The shoe is really soft, so it flattens easily and loses shape.  It's a very nice looking shoe. But my lack of stars really comes from the material being too soft to hold good shape.  :/"
The bottoms fit pretty good but the top was very stiff and not at all fitted.  It was sent back for a refund!
"I like this shirt, but I can already tell I'll like it a lot more in about a year. Its still pretty stiff.
One complaint: you can't roll up the sleeves unless you roll them past your elbow. I think this shirt needs a second set of buttons on the sleeve, such that the wearer can only roll up the sleeves halfway, which is what I tend to do."
I sent this back. The fabric just didn't hang right for me.
"Length of the product was a little long, but I'm ""short-waisted"" and a little hard to fit in that respect."
I like the necklace but the clap is to close so it is very difficult to close. I put an extension.
These aren't too bad. I didn't expect them to be see through but I guess I'll just wear a longer shirt with them. I would recommend them as a last choice but definitely do some other shopping.
Not very substantial material...it's quite flimsy but it does the job.  They stack nicely in the drawer and serve the purpose of keeping it organized.
"These are really nice, but I have to return them.  They are too small.  I wear a 6.5 - 7.5 so I bought a 7 not wanting the space boot look.  Needless to say they are too small.  My toes are at the end and there is no way I could wear them.  So sad."
Okay  for thexample price
The size listed was not comparable to other Carhartt pants of the same size. I have other Carhartt pants and though I could simply order the exact same size and twy would fit. This pair seemed to be at least 2 sizes smaller than what they normally are.
"Really cute top but very thin and obviously low quality, I returned because I felt that they were too thin to go to work in"
Took too long to arrive but nice shoes
"The top is MUCH bigger than the bottom. If you get an XL like I did, the boobs are like a DD but the waste is like a medium. If I ordered a size smaller it would fit my boobs but not my waste. I have a 36 D cup size for reference and wear a size 12 in jeans"
The collars are a little weird with extra fabric along the seams especially at back of neck
The cups are a bit small but still a good product
"This dress fits great, however, in the picture it looks navy blue...it is NOT!! The material is very thin which is nice for summer, but the color shown in the picture is not correct. It is royal blue!"
"Nice petticoat; first one I ever ordered, so not sure what to expect; kinda short; lot of fluff; would have probably ordered a longer version if it was available and minimize the tulle abit."
very lightweight and will serve the purpose of King Triton's trident - after we paint it and put a dowel through the hollow tubes for added strength
I really wish SOMEONE would learn & understand that linen shirts are for leisure not a dress shirt (in my book)
This was a freebie. To big for my taste.
Very cute but larger than expected
"Nice quality, but much too narrow."
Too big on me.
"I love the style and fabric; however, I ordered an XL, and the waist and and hips were very small, and the length was WAY too long. I am 5'8, and the legs were at least 4 inches beyond the floor."
Nice sweater fits really small.  Ordered my normal size and should have ordered 1-2 sizes up
"My son has huge, smelly feet. These fit him well. They were snug but not too tight, they didn't spin or bunch. However, he didn't notice any difference with foot sweat or stink once they had been on his feet for an entire day at school."
Much larger than I expected.  I ended up cutting the blue shirt out so it wouldn't swallow my teenager son.  The vest and poncho were better quality than I expected.  If the sizing was right I would give 5 stars.
"It's just what I wanted. It arrived several days before the delivery date too. And that's amazing considering I'm about 70 miles out of town in Alaska. It's so warm, it really keeps away the drafts and chills after a shower. I should of ordered it long ago.
 After having this robe a while I thought I would come back and update my review. As other reviewers have noticed it does snag really easy. I was brushing my hair and the brush bristles hooked on the loops and they unraveled. My pomeranian put her paws on my leg and they unraveled. The sleeves have gotten snagged on things and they unravel. You get the picture I guess. This is a really nice warm robe but it won't look very nice if you wear it much unless you just sit there in a nice soft chair with your feet up. All and all I would buy it again but I think considering how easily it snags it should sell for half or less then it does. A person could make a much better quality one for much less themselves if you have a machine and basic sewing skills."
"Purchased in late September. After a trip to the YMCA, they took on water and now randomly flash. Inappropriate to wear to school anymore.  Cannot turn off! Frustrated and dissappointed!"
"Cute slightly thicker leggings/tights, but they pilled horribly after ONE wear.  After washing they look worse and somehow thinner. They're really tights not leggings. They have that weird tights crotch and some kind of bands of thicker fabric around the thighs."
Cute just runs big
"I own six pairs of GoWalk Skechers, and they fit like gloves. I just couldn't believe the same company would make a shoe that was so drastically larger in size. I was a moron. I should have read all the reviews before purchasing. These are at least a whole size too large. They may actually be a size an a half large. I would recommend buying a size smaller when purchasing."
a little small for the size I order
Nice boot but 2 sizes too big
Good but run small..
One size does NOT fit all!!!!!!
"I have never found Polyester very comfortable.  This is 100% Polyester and it seems to have all of the worst qualities of Polyester  sort of inflexible and scratchy.  I don't know how many washes it will take before it softens up a bit.

It looks nice and I suppose that matters to some pre teens."
I always wear a XXL for the loose fit and comfort.  This jacket has kind of a snug fit for a XXL.  Too bad it doesn't come in a XXXL.  I like the windbreaker otherwise.
"Fits well, good material. They can be unfolded if you need a little more length. I always love socks that state the size on the sock itself.  However, I wouldn't call these ""non-skid"".. the only traction at the bottom is the writing saying the size.  It's fine for my hardwood floors and cautious 2 year old, but if you have an active dare devil of a child, you probably want to look at the non-skid socks at Buy Buy Baby where the entire sole is a thin layer of traction bearing plastic."
Didn't think they would be so hard and big. Gave them to my granddaughter to use.  My fault. New and still in the box
I like the color. However everyone is right about the sizing. I typically wear a medium and I bought a large for this color and bought and XL for the 2nd shirt. I wish I bought both XL.  If you wear a size bra that is DD and over you need to but 2 sizes up. I gave this shirt to my 13 year old daughter who is skinnier than a tooth pick.
"The only patterned maternity scrub top I've found.  It's cute, but really long.  I'm a petite person so this almost looks like a little maternity scrub dress, lol.  A little awkward."
"I picked up a few of these and they're pretty ok.  At 5'9, 185lbs with a muscular and toned build, I picked them up in a Large.  When I first put them on, the fit is nice and form fitting.  However, the one thing which prevents me from giving them a higher rating is that after having them on for a few hours, they stretch and lose their form fitting.  I don't think they're worth the price, really.  I much prefer the C-IN2 Zen Tanks to these.  Yes, they're pricier but much better quality and an amazing fit for an athletic physique."
"This is a super cute bag with great pockets and functionality but it really is a preschool size bag.  This will not work for any child that has a normal sized American folder or picture books.  It is great for maybe a paper, an orange and a sweater and to make a toddler feel cool, but don't get this for elementary aged kids."
I tried the 9 first and i had about 3/4 of an inch gap behind my heel. So I tried the 8.5 and it was way TOO SMALL. The 9 is huge and the 8.5 won't fit? Something is wrong with these sizes... The shaft of the boot is rather large also
"I liked these shoes a lot and they are really beautiful! Unfortunately they were a bit tight around the ankles, I tend to get swelling there, so I had to return them."
"Even though these are wide width, they're still tight across the ball of my foot and not too comfortable.  I'm a little disappointed.  However, they're cute."
"It should have had the girl first,then the weed and a slice of pie. Haha.
CHICK-N-POT PIE HAHAHA HA AHAHA"
Looks cute and works like its supposed to but it tears very easily.  Not sure if I tore it within a few days of wearing it or if I just didn't notice it was that way when it came.  Rubber feels great against my skin and Ive gotten lots of compliments aesthetically.
a little small but nice sweater
I purchased this for part of a Halloween costume and ended up returning.  It wasn't terrible just not exactly what I needed.  The quality is what you would expect for the price - definitely cheap looking and the rhinestones will likely fall out after a shot period.  I think it's fine for a costume but not something I would wear out on a regular night.
"Shipping was great and the shoes look beautiful, but they are so stiff that they are REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE!"
"Very cute, the material is a little costume like, and thin, but still very cute!"
"Sorry to say but not great. They don't breath. I have never had stinky feet (not even wearing slippers barefoot). But wow these made my feet smell. I tried powder in the shoes, febreeze, everything. It has strips of shiny plastic or whatever it is and it looks weird. Which I could put up with because I only needed them for work. But because they made my feet sweat and smell so bad I don't wear them anymore. Had to get new shoes."
"Nice bag, holds lots of stuff.  Be careful if you carry heavy stuff...the handles untied at the worst time (late to a bus and was running).  Easy enough to fix, but now I am afraid of this happening again."
They are extremely comfortable but to short and a little small. I ordered more in the large and fit was much better. Still slightly short though. Some girls have very long legs and these are made for the short legs.
Pleased with them even with the length longer than I expected. I have roll up the cuffs some to keep them from getting frayed on the bottom. Would buy again.
"The socks are fine, comfortable, but they are too large.  I wear a size 8 shoe and they quickly flop around on my feet."
For a large it is very small. Make sure to order a larger size than what is normally needed. Color is fine
"One can see the panty lines. I m 5'4, 120lbs, ordered size small, fits me to the tee. I just need a looonng jacket that can cover my butt when i wear it, then i would enjoy wearing it."
"Great fitting, but developed holes quickly after three months of almost daily use. Half of the pairs already have holes and had to throw away one because my big toe popped right through it."
They just aren't Skechers. They are not as comfortable. They're cheaply made. The heel had an 'edge' that kinda cuts into my heel.
"It's a beautiful shoe, but I can no longer wear heels this high!"
cuter on picture....looks white on pic but is actually off white/beige
This is a basic lite weight lifting shoe meant for the novice weight lifter but if your a serious cross trainer you may want to invest in the reebok crossfit crosstrainers...
"the calf was WIDE, like I had room for two hands wide"
Careless
These are a bit snug and tend to slide up when wearing them. I bought them to go under my t-shirts in the fall/winter and find that I have to air dry them AND make sure to tuck them in my pants.
"This seems like a great sports bra and I wanted it to work so badly but the sizing is tough. I'm a pretty standard 36C (Victoria secret sizes anyway) so I ordered a 36C and it was too tight around the band. Painfully tight. A sports bra should be snug but this hurt. So I figured I needed a size up. The 38C was HUGE! I returned it. I found some other sports bras by Champion that are awesome and run a little more true to size.
This would be great for someone who is a really slender 36C.

Sizing issues aside I'm glad I tried it because the bra is great for the price, has good fabric and construction, and seems like it would provide great support. Also a bonus is it isn't a racer back (those hurt my neck). It's prime so I had free returns so if you need something that runs a but small I recommend trying it out if you can get free shipping for your return."
People rave about these so I decided to try them. I have plantar fasciitis so I was looking for relief. I found these to be like walking on marshmallows. They are too soft to provide any real support.
"Made a little small, should go a size up for comfort if possible."
The have really big bands on them.. My daughter still cannot wear them because they are so big.
"I purchased the L/XL size, but it was still too small.  Definitely a very bright color!  Hat scrunches up well for packing.  Even thought this is he largest size, the fit was just too tight."
"I wanted an easy flowing dress to wear at home. This is perfect. My only dislike is the neckline, which is too big. It shows my bra straps."
"If these were $10-$15 they would be a goodbye. The memory foam is good, they are cute, they have a cheap soft for on the outside, but on the inside its like a fleece fabric. I wore them for a few hours and my feet didn't get warm, I have pretty cold feet so I need something to actually warms my feet up. They were comfortable so I was tempted to keep them but I need something to keep my feet warm and for $20 I expected a little bit better quality."
"It fits well and the material falls very nicely and it's flattering enough, but the bottom wasn't hemmed. I don't know if it's on purpose. Since i'm pretty short it wasn't too noticable, but it's worth mentioning to future buyers."
"Product runs small in the chest area. The breast openings stay open so you have to wear something under it or else you are exposing everyone! Otherwise, it is a cute, well-made nightgown."
"Great design, shirts fit WAAAY too small, go up at least one size."
I wear a small to medium in shirts and mediums in skirts. I ordered the M/L size thinking it would fit perfect. It fits like an extra small. The sizing is the only complaint that I have because the material is very soft & comfortable. It is very thin but warm at the same time which is good if you don't want the bulky look. I would probably order this sweater again if they make it in XXL. Good luck.
Had to return. Too small in the arms
Comfortable shoe just runs a little bit big.
"Not good quality. Didn't Fit well, NOT Much SUPPORT With Straps or shoe. Dissapointed."
Nice but no insulation.  I gave mine for gifts.
"I bought 2 colors in this blouse.  The lake blue was nice and the length was appropriate for the size, xxxl.  I ordered up 2 sizes due to other reviews.  The peru not so much.  It was significantly shorter and smaller.  My lake blue one almost 30"" long in center from shoulder and edges dropped another 4-5"".  On the peru color it was only 25"" long in center and dropped to about 29"" on edge.  The overall blouse was at least an inch shorter on the sleeves as well as width of tee was an inch smaller on each side.  So it is a crap shoot on what size and length you will get.  I may return the Peru color for another color just to see if I get lucky and get a longer one to wear with leggings.  This is a thin jersey silk type tee.  So it is clingy, but I love the colors, I just wish the quality control actually checked sizes.  But when they don't give measurements that is always a concern."
"I was mistaken when I thought they weren't delivered. They were. But they're so small, I overlooked them. Make sure you use a ruler or some form of measurement before you order."
"Well, they work okay I guess, but they are awkward over prescription glasses, I would only do that if I were pretty desperate. I also tried just wearing them stand alone but they don't fit well and don't stay in place very well. They are inexpensive and they do a good job with blocking the light when you have them on and properly positioned, and they don't seem to be terribly/cheaply made"
"Great for having a fun variety.  They stand up well and are good for the price, but if you want a serious quality bow tie, this probably isn't it."
Shorts are a little long but button tops with shirts are hard to find.
Just ok......that says it all.
"I'm usually a 6.5 in heels and 7 in flats, but these were a little snug."
"I love the cute style, however it is cheaply made."
not as much support as I had hoped for. I wouldn't rate these as any more comfortable/supportive than average. Better than a flip flop
Okay sandal but fit a bit snug (My feet are wide though. The sole isn't very comfortable either. A bit bulky looking as well.
Sizing inconsistency
"They are cute shoes but the toe is more rounded than in the picture. They were way tight when I got them & I thought they would stretch with wear, but no such luck. I'm hoping that shoe stretchers will work."
"Liked the fit, cute design, plastic buttons look cheap"
"While the ring looks lovely and the stones are quality cz,  band is heavy and solid sterling silver,  all the stones were loose and rattling when it arrived.  I tightened then with small pliers,  and now they're fine.  Can't give it 5 stars, but still decent for the price."
"I bought a red top just like this one a couple of months ago and loved it; however, I can't wear this one in black. The reason is because it is at least two inches longer and wider than the original top. If it is a one-size top, shouldn't the sizing be consistent? It is a very cute top, but the sizing is just not consistent, so I had to send it back. So sorry!"
"I used this 30 years ago, and it was the best.  For some reason, it did not work on my New Balance running shoes.  Maybe my fault by not letting it get to tack before clamping.  But as I recall, it was the best and saved a lot of my shoes."
"shoe  too  tight  at  the  front  strap  and i  had to
return them,  though very  dressy,good  feet  support
well  padded"
"Cute cut and nice style, but the fabric is SO uncomfortable!"
"Not a swing dress by any means. It does fit and is cute, though not as expected. Material is also not what I thought it would be. I hope it doesn't fail me when laundered. I'm keeping it as it's an addition to my wardrobe."
"I really liked the colors and designs these purse hooks.  I have used one of them a few time, but unfortuantely I broke (after about 10 uses).  It cannot be fixed, the arm broke off.  I was going to give the remainder of these to family as a small token ""thinking of you gifts"" but if they brake after a dozen or so uses, I may just hold on to them and use them till they are all gone.  I do not want to give a gift that will be no good after a few uses."
"Initially it fit the way I wanted it to.  Unfortunately I tossed it into the washing machine- cold wash, cold rinse and then lowest setting on the dryer.  The shirt shrunk considerably in length.  I had ordered a much bigger size than needed but shirts should not shrink when you follow the washing instructions!"
"Smaller than expected. Have to give it away as a gift. Too bad. Love the colors, style, design."
It's ok.  Kind of bulky in my opinion.
"oh, these fit good.  only issue is extreme fading after just 1 wash"
"Hat is TOO small. Adjustable band BARELY adjusts enough to fit my 7 5/8 head, but then the HEIGHT is too small. Sits on my top like a beanie, and hurts my head.

PS: Apparently this cap is known as ""low profile"", which I guess means it's SUPPOSED to be short...hmm, maybe I'll give it some more time?

UPDATE: I've come to like this hat more and more, however, as I've worn it through most of the hot weather of summer, the color on the front of the bill has started to fade. At first I thought it was just getting dirty/dusty from my fingers putting the hat on, and taking it off, but I've washed the bill with sprayed plain water, and it's definitely losing its color. This isn't horrible, as it kinda makes the hat look ""saltier"", but it would be better if the entire had was fading similarly, not just the tip of the bill."
"They were very cute shoes, and I love that they came with a second set of laces. I'm not quite able to pull them off (a little too edgy for me), so I returned them.

Watch the pricing changes! I had to make a modification to my order and accidentally canceled the entire thing. When I went to reorder them two minutes later, the pricing jumped $15. This made me change my rating from 4-stars down to 3-stars."
"I had been pining after these boots for a very long time and decided to finally bite the bullet and order them. In terms of quality, they are (mostly) outstanding. The leather and soles are solid in every way.

In terms of comfort, I agree with most other reviewers in that they are a bit stiff at first but do start breaking in as you wear them.

As for sizing, they are definitely true to size. I'm a solid 8.5 and they fit perfectly (with a regular and also a thicker sock).

Only thing is that I couldn't ignore a nagging sensation in the heel of my left boot... sure enough, when I pushed down with my fingers, I could feel a nail poking through. Darn it. I really wanted to keep and love these boots but it seems to me that if I'm going to pay this much for a quality boot, that I should have received a quality boot.

They'll be sent back shortly... thankfully Amazon has an amazing return policy. I may risk buying another Frye product again, but I'm a bit skeptical. At the same time, it's hard to ignore the other (very positive) reviews."
"I guess 3 out of 5 is not bad, but it's not enough to motivate me to buy this set again.  I might, however, buy a few of the items separately.  The products are made of good ingredients, most of them natural and organic.  Organic fruit acid complex, peptides, DMAE, alpha lipoic acid, Vitamin C and CoQ10 are some of the ingredients and you will *not"" find parabens, petroleum, propylene or butylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfates, pesticides, phthalates, artificial dyes or fragrances. And the products are not tested on animals.  All this is a big plus in beauty products.

Now as to what's in this kit:

1) 2 oz. Green Apple cleansing gel.  This is a very runny gel so you must be careful when squeezing the tube not to get out too much or have it run away from you.  As for its effectiveness, it seems to work OK. It has a foaming action and the skin feels clean after use, but mine also feels a bit dry.  But then, that's why there are moisturizers.

2)  .5 oz. Green Apple peel, full strength.  Another OK product.  Apply to your face and leave on for 10 minutes, rinse off, and there is a definite exfoliation effect without excessive harshness.  As with the cleaning gel, I also found this to be a bit drying.

3)  .25 oz. Green Apple Age Defy serum.  This is also OK but, unlike some other serums I have used on my skin, this one dries my skin somewhat.  Again, there are moisturizers included in the kit so no big deal.  However, the moisturizers included here are the two products of the kit that I do not like.

4)  .5 oz. Green Apple SPF15 moisturizer.  This is for day use.  It moisturizes and protects (somewhat) from the sun.

5)  .5 oz. Green Apple Age Defy moisturizer.  No sun protection.  This is for your nighttime moisturizing treatment.

Of the 5 products listed above, the two I did not care for are the moisturizers.  They left my skin feeling like it couldn't breathe properly, and that was even when I used just a small amount.  I am used to clear serums and oils, such as rosehips seed oil, and like the way those moisturize and absorb into the skin much better than these two Green Apple products do.

So my bottom-line opinion is that this kit is not a necessary addition to my bathroom cabinet.  I'm happy enough with the peel but am just as happy with a good scrub product.  And as for the moisturizers here, they're a ""No, thank you, I have my own favorites already.""  However, a Juice Beauty product that I am especially happy with but not included in this kit is their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juice-Beauty-Stem-Cellular-Repair-Eye-Treatment-0-5-fl-oz/dp/B004I14JD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Repair Eye Treatment, 0.5 fl. oz.</a>.  That has a definite place of honor in my cabinet."
"Not very durable, so go easy with it.  It's great for smacking bugs though."
"The coins were difficult to get out, though I loved the smallness and compactedness of the coin purse. I ended up returning it."
"The shirt was nice quality.  It was a nice soft flannel.  I am 5""10"" tall and a 42DD,  and I was looking for a tunic type shirt to wear with stretchy pants and my back side would be covered.  It was not quite long enough, but for most it would be (I just have this problem because I am taller) but the chest was certainly not big enough.  I couldn't button it without it looking like I was ""breaking out"" of the shirt.  I felt the shoulders were kind of tight also.  I could have sized up, but it would have been too wide and would have looked too big.  It was nice, but not for my body type.  I also thought the button up feature on the bottom was kind of strange.  I would have never used them."
"this ran really small, I ordered a 3t, for my son and before washing it was too small. After washing-according to the instructions- it had shrunk enough for my son in 18mo clothes to be able to wear."
"Unfortunately, one of the arch straps came apart and I had to return them. It was only the second time I'd worn them, so I didn't have a lot of history with them, however, up to the point it happened, they were fine. I've never had a FitFlop, but am attracted to some of their footwear, and I'm sure I'll give them another try. I'm giving the company a 3 star because the return/refund was smooth and other reviewers have good things to say, so I choose to believe this was an anomaly regarding the overall quality of their footwear"
"I bought a toddler size for my 17-month-old, and it's too small/ short. So I returned it and exchanged for a small size which is the only other choice. And it came in the mail today, fitting children age 4-6!! How come they don't have anything in between? Unbelievable."
Very hard to see anything g when the sun is glaring overhead. They do look nice.
not skinny but nice material
The mask is cute and made well. The reason it didn't receive a higher rating is because I did not like the ribbon they attached to it to keep the mask in place. The ribbon is flimsy and unravels very easily. The mask did not feel secure while wearing it.
"received this shoe per scheduled with no delay. nice pair of shoe per my other rockport. In total, i own 4 pairs of rockport shoe and they are all good shoes. This particular model however has one strange feature, the sole is oversize at the side, meaning there is an extra sole to shoe space of about 5mm across the whole shoe on all side. Maybe the designer meant to have it like snow shoe, providing maximum area to stay on surface of snow. overall quality is ok"
"It's thin, but could be absorbent with the lining around the front.  A bit snug.  I haven't used in hot weather (it's minus 12 degrees right now)."
The arms were odd proportions.
"It was a pretty watch, but HUGE! I sent it back because it was so freakin heavy on my wrist and I knew it would be uncomfortable for me, but if you are expecting a very large piece of jewelry maybe you would love it?"
Like the way it fits and looks.  Not liking that it's only water resistant and not waterproof.
"it's okay for a party with a red dress code.  I wish the pants were a bit longer, but the fit was great."
"I only gave this 3 stars because the shirt itself is fine. However it fits EXTREMELY small. I couldn't even get it over my head and I usually wear a size L, I ordered a XXL because of the reviews and it was still too tiny. Gave it to my neice. If you are VERY petite this is a good item but unless you usually wear a XXS beware of ordering this item."
"Good quality material, more like plain grey than dark grey, somewhat smaller (than the one I bought; I bought two large sizes in different style). If not the colour it would make a four star."
The cut of the top is cute but it's so sheer and see through. It's also difficult to make out the skull pattern.
"they shrunk in the wash and the quality is mediocre. worked well enough for her while she fit them, but i can't save them for the next baby."
"I love these shoes and have purchased multiple pairs in black as well as brown but his version with the lace pattern I'm not fond of.  I purchased this version because I am no longer able to find the black maxi calf and wanted to like these but no matter how much I try they are just not for me and they are far less versatile than the black maxi.  I really wish I could find the black maxi, would buy them again."
"I have other Merrells in size 9, but these are much too large. They are being returned."
Nice but too small and the posts are too short
I order gold plated got a received a silver color overall not bad product but I am disappointed that I ordered gold and got sober non marked lol up set
long and fits well but very very thin quality dress. Its basically see through
"the back of the shoe kept breaking down and turning under when trying to get this shoe on. Then when I did get it on, the shoe didn't hit my arch in the right place."
"Pretty earrings, but one has the clasp loose so I have to be careful to tighten it gently whenever I wear them."
"I can't wear these as high waist pants, right where the waistline should get smaller it flairs out. Not enough to readily fall off but they do need to be folded over on the hip so it fits right."
"These are only ok.  I really like Stride Rite, the shoes are flexible and appear comfortable.  My problem with this shoe is that it is difficult to get on/off.  It doesn't open wide enough.  Maybe my daughter just had fat feet, but it was just very difficult getting these on (especially on a wiggly toddler) so she didn't get very much wear out of them at all."
"I wanted to like this but couldnt, poor craftsmanship. The bottom felt like if i were to accidently walk on a sharp stone it may lose air. Not worth $40 , i sent it back."
"The boots are very nice looking. However, I found that they run very narrow."
"Didn't fit Properly, returned."
"THIS IS NOT A CARRY ON !
In every airport I was asked to check it in.
It's to fat with out anything in it.
Had to check in LA, Chicago,
London, Paris and Madrid ...
Useless
The bigger one was completely ruined coming back from Chicago on the 1st trip
Wheel and all ...not a good design for traveling"
Out of also 10 items only 1 was great most I never got .
"This bag had some nice aspects and some not-so-nice. I liked the colors, but it was much smaller than I like my handbags to be and the metal near where the straps start has a very odd shape. I returned this."
"Very adorable colors and patterns, but the fabric was thinner than I had expected."
Like the shoes but they seem more like size 8.  Ouch!  Have to decide if cost of return is worth it.
I'm a 160 lbs 5' 4 female wanting to wear these around the house -- they are a little bigger than expected but do the job sort of. I should've gotten a smaller size but these will do.
"I ordered this pair hoping it would be comfortable for a lot of walking.  However, it was not.  It is very pretty and I love the color.  I used it around the house and outside too to break it in but it wasn't like my old skechers.  For short walks or short wear time it's okay but not for extended walking or wear times.  I still have hopes it get better."
"Because of the height of the heel needs at least 1 inch platform to help with balance, walking a little shaky"
lenses pop out easily.
"This dress is soooo cute!  I was extremely disappointed that it was too small.  I normally wear dresses in M or L and XXL was too small for my chest.  Had to send back, but if you don't have a larger chest just order up a size or two.  It is really pretty!"
It's dyed green Jade.  Looks like a piece of plastic.
"the top of the costume does not quite look like the top in the picture. it has an uncomfortable elastic like a sleeveless shirt would and the stripes that go across in the picture are not like that in the product i received. The wings kind of look like the wings in the picture, but i thought that they would have shiny specs instead of darker grey specs and lines. the skirt is perfect though. I have detached it and intend to sew it onto an elastic band so that i can use it with a shirt that i sew to look more like the one in the picture."
Much too small and not true to size. If you want to buy this I would recommend going up one or two sizes.
Longer then I expected. Had to punch another hole for some pants. Probably my fault.
I gave these away... Not a good brand for me. They were very small.
"I am 5'3"" and 120 LB. I ordered small size but still it's smaller and I think medium is perfect for me. Material is good but very thin."
"The shoes looked beautiful, however I returned because they were too large.  Unfortunately, the size I needed was a lot more expensive, so I chose a different shoe."
Soles are wearing down faster than I thought they would
"These are going to take a while to break in around the big toe. Love the look, and the cushion under my feet."
"I like the shirt but the material is a thin and the shirt was a little smaller than expected, I suggest order one size up from what you normally buy and you should be good. I think also the shirt shrank in the wash so there's that too."
I knew this would be small but it was barely readable for my mom.  We got it for her on her birthday and she had to put on her glasses to read what it said.  A little disappointing.
"I am giving it a 3 because...on the package there is a warning.  They are obviously not BPA friendly, I will attach a photo.  The lighter tag already shows color wear on the green dot.  Doubt the color will last long with my travels, They are however sturdy.  The black baggage attachment  has two holes where you press the knobs into to secure it.  Label is nice; place for name, address, landline phone, mobile phone and email.  If you just want a colorful tag then this is it.  If you don't want cancer warnings then look elsewhere."
"Small in width, had to stuff a wine bottle in it for a week to try and stretch it. The length was ok but its a tight fit. Not sure ordering a bigger size would be wise."
Not very warm!
"They fit great but I am just not sure I like the look. Something about them I am not happy with.  As for the boot size or fit, I have no issues"
I really love Bernardo sandals. They are pricey but worth it. They do run a size small though.
"Got these for my son, who always has worn 33"" waist. He s 5ft 11in weighs 155lbs, he can t  these over his hips! Sizing is Not accurate, beware!"
It is a bit large for me.  But I am keeping it.
"Seemed nice enough, but for something that was supposed to fit up to a size 12 in girls, there's no way. My 5 yr old Granddaughter who is NOT chubby, was pinched in the waist & was way too uncomfortable. The drawstring was useless as the elastic was just too tight & small. Boo."
It's ok I guess It doesn't really look like the pic it's really really long & I found it to run kinda big I'm 5'4 115lbs got a small
"These were returned, as the shaft was too narrow.  The C-D footbed was just perfect, and very comfortable, but I will need a wider calf.  Unfortunately, I did not see that these came in a wide-shaft option."
"I ordered 2 sizes up based on the other reviews, however, It probably would have fit better if I just ordered one size up. It was a little too big."
much much much smaller
"So when I got these I was sooo pumped... But as we were handing them out we discovered that many had broken backs. Most that the backs wouldnt come off. So all and all, and given the reason for me buying them, I'm alittle disappointed in them"
"Looks like you get what you pay for with this product.  They should work for trips, though the material seems cheap, and the stitching looks like it won't last.  I returned the 2nd set.  I should have saved my money and bought stuff from Blue Ridge Overland Gear."
"The sandal is fine, but a bit narrow.  Wider sandal (or even option to buy a wider size version) and this would be a 4* for the wife.  She does appreciate the heel protection that is typically not included on most sandals."
just ask one number up
the material is very thick and heavy for a short
"Worked for halloween, no idea where they are now."
i iike it just that i think the price should have been less. many compartments ... beautiful colour
"Thought these would fit like the Go Walk Skechers I bought this summer. These are tight in the toes. I'm going to send these back.
Not sure if I should go up a size. I wear a 10 and there aren't 1/2 sizes after size 10, so I would have to order an 11. I liked the style looked nice. I have 3 pairs of the summer styles and really like them."
"I got this for my wife for Christmas and we are only a little bit past Christmas now and it is already broken. My wife has had wallets like this before and always has a good amount of stuff in her wallet but actually had less in this wallet then she had in her last wallet which gave her no issues at all. I was very disappointed when she came home to show me the bottom of it ripped, I realize you don't want to over fill it but it shouldn't be ripping that easy, Like I said she had less in this one then her last one which is actually still working fine and will probably have to go back to that one.

As for the look of the wallet, I think it looked really good and she loved the design of it. I have no issues with the way everything looks on it.

I don't think I would go back to this brand, it could of been that I got one that wasn't up to par but after how quickly it broke I am disappointed."
"Individually I like the manicure tools in this set.  The metal is high quality, the finish is beautiful, and they feel sturdy and well-balanced in my hand.  The nail clippers are sharp and worked well on both my finger and toe nails.  The cuticle tool is two in one.  It works both to push the cuticles back and to remove stuff from under the nails.  The tweezers is amazing; it can pluck out even the shortest hairs (although I do wish it was a little longer).  But the nail file was a big miss for me.  I found both sides of the file a little too coarse for my needs.  My fingernails are thin and tend to flake, so the coarse grit of the file just ripped my nails instead of smoothing them.  And the scissor In all honesty Im a little intimidated by the scissor.  It is wicked looking.  It is super pointy and super sharp, and in my klutzy hands it is a disaster waiting to happen.

But my biggest issue with the set it the ash wood box that holds all the tools.  The box is attractive and well made, but the thing does not open for cleaning.  The metal top is glued to the tall wooden box, and there are holes in the metal sized to fit the five different tools.  There is also a spongy thing at the bottom of the box to keep the longer tools from hitting the base and getting damaged.  Im not a germaphobe or overly afraid of bugs, but two seconds after realizing the top wasn't removable I started to wonder what was lurking in that dark, airless box.  Bacteria, mold, mildew, spiders, termites.  Anyone else live in fear of spring time termite swarms?  Those bugs go everywhere and get into anything.  I really, really wish the top was removable.

So all the items in the set are high quality and attractive, but I will only end up using half the items in the set.  Given the price, make sure you can use all the pieces before you make a purchase."
Looks nice and seems to be decent quality but they don't fit. I think the size is pretty close but I can't get my foot all the way in. I would order a size larger. I wear 11.5 boot and I thought the 11 would fit but I was wrong. It's more like a 10 or 10.5
"I bought this swimsuit for doing laps at the pool for exercise. I usually do a variety of different strokes over the course of a 40-minute workout. These shorts do pretty well for most strokes, but when doing breaststroke they bunch up on your leg in an way that restricts movement. The shorts themselves are light-weight, feel durable, and fit fine; but I wish they were designed in a way that they didn't grab your thigh when doing breaststroke."
I actually like the shoe but they need to be ordered a size down.  They run large.
"These are the most comfortable slippers I have ever owned. I have been wearing them everyday for a month and the comfort is still the same. They are warm and rather wide, providing lots of space for your feet. I would recommend wearing them with socks however because of how warm they are, they will make your feet sweat :/ My 3 stars review is due to this: After only wearing them inside for a month, it has already ripped at the seams and the sole is coming out. They are amazingly comfortable but kind of cheaply made. For this reason, I won't purchase these again and I doubt I will want to buy another pair of Mukluks anytime soon."
"I guess it's a vendor thing. I bought a pair at Fred Meyer that fit great - bought same size through Amazon, twice, and jeans are huge and really bag out. Had to return. Color is great, tho."
"I had to wear bandaid for 3 weeks, took a little getting use to, back was too tight on heel at first, but that was all better in 3 weeks"
handle too short  for this bag
THE SHOES WERE ATTRACTIVE.  THEY JUST WEREN'T RIGHT FOR ME.
It was not a relaxed fit.  I was hoping for a comfy sweater to wear over leggings.  It was okay but Cheaper than I expected for this price.  You can buy better for $30.  Returned it because I knew I would never wear it.
"I saw all these reviews to buy larger than your size so I did. It was definitely too big. A beautiful dress, but the shoulder straps were sliding off and it was too roomy."
"It's a nice comfortable material, it's cute on, I just need to stitch it up a little in the chest area because it leaves little to the imagination."
"Not the colors pictured. I wanted more dark colors and not as many patterns. Otherwise, they fit well and hold up after washing."
"So one person wrote a review that they light up, one person that they don't light up? Very disappointed the ones I received do NOT light up. Why Amazon would give one kind to one person and a different kind to the next is really annoying because I bought these hoping they did light up! If you zoom in on the picture it looks like they have the little lights on the side, mine did not have them! May return, disappointed! Otherwise a cute shoe with no lights."
"This shoe fits a bit small, and the arch support isn't great, not like Reeboks normally feel.  Feels like a cheap imitation, but i did keep them and wear them, but they're not comfortable for long walks."
"I wanted this vest to work, but I'm sending it back. I agree with the other reviewer (maybe more than one) who noted that the armholes flare out strangely, as does the top of the armhole at the shoulder. It's as if the vest was made for a football player to wear over shoulder pads. Not an attractive look. I loved the red color, it's primary red, and the quilting is thin, which I loved. The neck is pretty high, and the fit is slim. Hope this helps others."
not much to it. good for a prop for a costume but not for everyday play
Zipper malfunctioned returning product.
Somewhat narrow in fornt.
"The shoes have the look that I wanted. I looked at what others were saying about size and was able to get the correct size. These are short and narrow. I agree with the other reviews on the lack of cushion. I have wide feet with a narrow heel, so these are OK for my odd feet. The statements about the narrow heel are true."
"Very cute, wish it is leather."
Very sexy beautiful dress BUT was too big on the back/sides just fell off my shoulders. I'm 5'3 130 athletic build (small boobs) lol. Everywhere else looked awesome but too big on sides and shoulders :(
Love gowns for newborns especially first few weeks when too tiny for sleeper. However these have elastic bottom that does not give much which makes it difficult to put on and change diaper.  However when laying around perfect.
size is larger than expected.
"The dress is very pretty!  I'm 5'9"" and it was a little shorter than I expected but not entirely too short.  What ever you do, do not dry this dress!  I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it shrunk up so much the armholes were tight!  I had ordered two sizes and kept the larger size.  After going through the dryer it fit like the smaller size.  I loved the dress so much I wasn't ready to give up so I ordered it again, washed it in cold water and air dried it on a hanger.  I hope that works as I have not tried it on yet."
"After one wash, the stiching has already come out of the waist band."
"I had to return this but I'm giving it 3 stars anyway b/c it was made well and looks just like the picture. It just runs REALLY small. I'm 5'10 around 200 lbs, usually wear a XL but this XL was way too small. The straps at the top weren't put in right, they were crisscrossing so I undid them but was unable to get them back in the loops.

All in all, if you order go up a size."
"The second time I wore these shoes, the right heel ripped almost clear off from the rest of the shoe. So, inspect them carefully before going far.

Otherwise, the soles are comfortable and the fit is nice, so walking a few miles in these was very doable. They doubled as casual and dress shoes for my trip, which makes them a very functional choice (as long as they are intact)."
Not a lot of structure.
"I love the shoes design great shoes for office. I got compliments daily, I order size 11 and it came little to tight, after few weeks they were just fine. However, after one year the heals were worn down."
"jacket is well made, it's a nice jacket, but the size runs small."
I received this ring and beside the pearl being smaller than I expected the luster on the pearl was not very good. The pearl was great in uniformaty but I purchased a white south sea pearl pendant around 10-11mm and the pearl in the pendant had so much nacre that I just couldn't keep the ring. I did however order another pearl ring at 9.5-10.mm and I am hoping it turns out to be better. I hope so because it was the last one available on Amazon! Thanks Amazon for showing some nice pieces!
"I bought these for my Florida vacation to wear on beach and in water. Shoes were a bit big even though they did not fall off my feet. However, the sand constantly collected in my shoes through the side hole area of these shoes. Every time I would have to wash out shoes and constantly dump out sand from wearing them. I ended up throwing them out the last day we were on vacation because of it."
"One ripped right away. I think they are very delicate, to say the least.  I wish more came in the package, but the idea is right.  When there are no other options out there that I have found, it is hard to bite a gift horse in the mouth.. is that the saying? haha"
"The shoes are cute and comfortable (but a little too big, so had to return).  I usually wear a size 7 or 7-1/2, but a 7 slipped in the heel.  Beware of purchasing from this site, as you have to pay to ship them back.  I would have never ordered from this vendor had I noticed that when I ordered them."
"Love the feel of the material.  Fit like I thought it would.  However the first time I wore the leggings received a ""run"" in the crotch area.  I would expect that to happen  with a pair of panty hose but not leggings.  I'm bummed!"
"good and fashion handbag, preaty, modern. its very confortable, big, cute, and nice. good option and good price, recommend this item"
"I like the look of these, but, for a man they seem a little small. They take a little bit of work to get them on but otherwise they look great
they lock on very nicely. also a great price."
"This bag is VERY big, I don't know if I missed that somewhere but it is extremely large, it hangs down to my knees and i'm 5'7"""
I don't know how to reset the time. Pls help
"The Right hand fit as expected, Had to struggle to get the left one on. Since it was a winter item, it sat in my closet for a couple of months before I tried them on. It was a sized item and I had no reason to think the left hand I measured. wouldn't fit. My bad for not trying them immediately!"
It gets me to my car without my leather shoes paying the price but they are too heavy for all day use.
"Its fix little bit tight  in chest, but I know that I have bigger tetas42dd I bought it large, one size down, next time I should have the normal size xl,i pick the color blue and they send me a turquoise, they should don't write blue ,like in the picture is really, at lease they send me a wrong color, i don't want it cause I had a lot of clothes at this color "
"My grandson takes size 5  Bought size 6 to make sure he has enough rm to grow  According to sizing chart size 6 should have fit him w/rm to grow  Pants fit fine but the top is tight  However he loves it and told my son, his dad, that's ok...I like it tight...LOL!  He's just happy he has Batman PJs."
Not a cute shoe but very comfortable. If you are thinking of buying these i would size down a half of a size. Very comfortable to wear and I honestly don't think these shoes would ever wear out if you wore them everyday.
"first of all the delivery n service was good but the clarks didnot keep up to the standards the leather seemed to be really cheap quality suede even a drop of water was like a stain on it which took alot if rubbing n polishing to take it off
plus the sole were so thin tht i had to take to my shoe maker n get an extra pad in humnn i would nt suggest these shoes for someone whose got sensitive feet well i just gave 3 star for amazon but im nt at allll satisfied with the shoe"
we'd probably love this shirt if we could get it in the size we need.
Wanted to use for nighttime reading on the computer but tint is much darker than I had anticipated. Made it challenging to read the screen.
I like the look  I accidentally ordered the wrong zodiac.. wanted Scorpio  but thats ok I guess.. The only thing I don't like is it has two snaps and only one that you can use. The bracelet  comes off easily....
the quality is below average. the front zipper broke in a couple of months
"Pretty nice quality, but size was barely correct; very short compared to most belts of the same designated size."
"SIZE UP! I ordered the 12 month size after someone gave me the 6 month size. The 12 month pants were smaller than the 6 month!!! Otherwise, they're great!!!"
"The shoes are cute and fit well, but I accidentally rubbed up on something and it took a huge chunk of plastic off the front of the shoe."
Ok too heavey
Not US sizes
These shoes are OK but I guess I got a bad pair. In one shoe there is some sort of bulge under the bottom at the arch that feel like a big lump. It is very annoying when walking. I guess I'll have to take it to the shoe shop to see if they can fix it.
"Very cute suit, but I thought the way it was designed that perhaps it would provide some support for my boobs and it really doesn't. I can't wear it. There really isn't any support. I thought if I tied the top a little tighter it would help. It doesn't. If you've got big ones, this isn't the suit for you. I knew I was taking a chance buying swimwear online, but the suit wasn't terribly expensive and I did buy another swimsuit the same day that I'm happy with."
The ring looks very nice but was to big for my husbands finger even though we ordered his size. Also it was much heavier than we thought it would be.
"I ordered it in a large...this large is more like an extra small.
the jacket is beautiful, but it looks much better in the picture...
it's much prettier in the picture...but I'm keeping it to see if I can get it enlarged by a seamstress..."
"The rhinestones fell off upon removing from package. Not just 1 or 2 either, but not a big deal- I like it better without."
"I ordered these for my mother, but she said they were too small (and she only uses Dansko shoes these days), so we returned them. The arch support wasn't enough for her job. Good try, but she went for a more expensive Dansko shoe instead. :3"
"Fits good, looks good but it's a cheap material. The neck rolled up in the front after one use, I didn't dry it and laid it flat so this wouldn't happen but no luck."
I ordered a small and a medium in this shirt to wear while I was in labor and as a nightgown afterward. The medium was big and the small was too tight and short. The fabric was fantastic and I loved the snaps in the front as well as the sits in the legs for ease of movement. I really wish this shirt would have worked out!
"Good shoe, but too tight I have Nike Air Max in the same size and there are perfect"
runs very big
"They are smaller than expected. My brother has heavy legs and they cut into his calf's and left marks. Too much of a hassle to return, I will donate to some charity."
"The colors are ugly but I guess the point is high visibility.

I also do not like that you have to remove the strap to see the address. People who find your bag may not know this. I prefer the old style, which had a slide out feature instead and didn't require dismantling the luggage tag to see the address and contact information.

That said, for the price paid for 2 of these, it's not worth it to return them for me."
"The belt is this sort of sad rubber mask kind of material. The robe is okay, but the hood is not very large and is open at the back. The shoe covers -
 Does anybody ever use the shoe covers? They're never any good. The wig was okay.

I got this for my daughter's halloween costume this year, but I ended up returning it for a nicer, better quality costume."
Bought it for my father in law. Good quality and the sole looks to be very comfortable. Unfortunately tight at the toes.
Just OK socks.  Expected them to be higher quality for the cost.
Cute jacket. Blue is just like picture. I am usually a size 4 for jackets and I ordered XXL and it is TIGHT in the breast area. Disappointed. Too expensive to send back so I will wear it open with a pair of jeans. Looks like the pockets are fake I'm too scared to try to pull them apart and find out that they are. Otherwise it is a cute jacket. Company needs to drastically change sizing. Also make real pockets and breast size is off.
"I was very pleased with a similar blouse I had bought on this site. So, I was very disappointed that though I ordered the same size this blouse is snug, not comfortable."
Husband says they are heavy & uncomfortable. But they're cheap & work.
"They are nice all weather shoes. They dry quick, don't get stinky, and breathe well. These shoes are just difficult to put on, you really have to stretch them open to fit a foot in, and the velcro could be better too. The end of the velcro strap tends to lift up often. I'm not sure I would buy them again for the price and minor flaws in design, but they work for now."
"I returned this shirt, as it runs a bit small.
The fabric, as another reviewer noted, is thin, especially in the white.
It looks nice, but you might need to wear a camisole top with it."
The straps seemed to fit okay but the ankle and heel area did not feel secure so for that reason I returned the shoes. I am giving it 3 stars and not 2 because they were very cute shoes and leather felt soft and nice. I do have wider toes and narrow heels so this shoe may be perfect for a normal foot
I didn't like.
"Love these shoes! Size wise, fits as expected, but the strap on the front was too wide for me, so I had to return them. Otherwise, great quality!"
"At this size, I was hoping it would have been clip-on rather than pierce. But it's nice."
I liked the color and style but too small. I gave it away as a gift.
Gorgeous fabric but it is HUGE.
"The actual color of the boot ended up darker than the photo. I was quite diappointmened as I liked the light brown color in the photo verses the very dark muddy brown I actually got. Otherwise, the boot was really nice! I returned this boot for the cognac color instead."
These are super light and fairly sturdy but they do appear to have really cheap zippers.
"Returned, not crazy about fit."
"Just ok, not really my style. Alittle old lady ish for my taste. If your looking for a comfy and loose shirt, it's perfect for you."
This is definitely a toy. Don't buy this unless you're looking for part of A costume or for your little kid. It is definitely a toy. but as a toy it's fine you can have a lot of fun running around the house with with your sheriff's badge And your cap pistol...
Beautiful dress. Way too small. I reordered two sizes bigger and am waiting for it to arrive.
"I think overall the costume is cute and sexy for how cheap it was. I was a little disappointed in sizing...Since there was no size to choose from I assumed it was ""one size fits most"" but the packaging size is labeled petite/small. I am 5'6 in between a small and medium ( size 4/6) with most of my weight on lower body. The material is stretchy so it fits.. I plan on using the wrap to hide the torso area where there is no breathing room or extra stretch/ruffles which I would have liked. This reason (the sizing) is why I give it a 3/5. I plan on keeping it as a safety but I ordered a completely different costume just to compare.
*************************************
UPDATE as of November 6, 2015: I now see that the advertised item is depicted with the Sizing - ""SMALL"". Good idea..
Just as an FYI - they had not done this previous when I purchased back in 2013.

Glad they have updated this and provided this information!"
"Not the worst underwear in the world, but not great. They're very baggy, but at the same time have kind of tight elastic around the leg openings, so they're like... to big and too small at the same time. But they are reasonably comfortable. I'd rather wear these than plain old classic tighty whiteys. They're okay for the cheap price I paid."
"This one is a bit large in the cup. Otherwise, I like it fine. I will keep it."
"I am a little torn....On one hand, the fabric is a decent quality and they are very comfortable to wear. On the other hand, detail of the print is very poor (I think because of the fabric type) and the shiny nature of the fabric highlights every bump and ripple. Let me go into more detail:

FABRIC:
- good, medium weight, very shiny
- Lycra or spandex (exactly like bathing suit material or 1980's workout suits)
- 4 way stretch (stretches in all directions) that has LOTS of stretchiness...easily to twice its size

STITCHING:
- Thread is very weak. These did not fit tight on me and after trying them on there are broken threads in the seams, that will need to be RE-STITCHED.
- This seems to be consistent with all the pairs of Chinese printed leggings I have bought on Amazon in the last month.

PRINTING:
- Very muddled. I did notice that the seller I purchased from (Sunnydate) has 2 versions of this same design. One version, you can see the detail of brush strokes and streaks of oil paint, the way it forms waves like icing on a cake. The version I received does not have any clear detail, and the lines are all blurred.
- This is my third pair of printed leggings....the other two designs I bought, Gustav Klimpt 'The Kiss' & Robot Skeleton, they both were MUCH more clean lined and clear. Those two have subtle shading and very fine line details.

THE FIT:
- Nice long waist, no plumber crack on a full butt and thighs.
- Very stretchy, will fit a more ""average"" size American woman

My measurements, for reference...
- Waist : 26""
- Hips at Widest: 38""
- Around thigh at widest: 21""
- Height 5' 2""

From reading other reviews, it sounds like there are a couple different versions of these being sold under the same heading. Keep that in mind when ordering."
I have had these boots for about a year now and they have held up well.  The fit is OK.  Compared to some other New Balance Boots I had these are not as trim fitting.
"Decent quality for the price. I'm 5'1"" 120lbs and the small fit me perfectly. The pants are soft and comfy to wear. Had one flaw in that the pockets weren't sewn in completely so there was a rather large hole in the right pocket. Plan on sewing it myself instead of returning it. If it weren't the minor inconvenience of having to mend it myself, I would have rated it 5/5."
"Eh, my son wears a four and these are on the smaller side especially after being washed and dried.  Not to mention they were taped and I managed to get the tape residue off of two of them, but not the third"
And a little on the thin side....
So I'm giving this 3 stars because it runs so small. I bought an xxl after reading the reviews and it fits perfect with flow. It is so cute! If I didn't read the reviews I would have given it 1 star for being too small. I normally wear a large in flowier tops.
Got this for my daughter that wears a medium in everything and other reviewers sounded like it fits as expected but it actually is a bit on the small side. It is a little bit tight on her chest and stomach area but arm length is slightly long. She wants to keep it rather than get a large because she says she would rather it a little small than baggy and arms way to long. So it is what it is I just hope the seems hold up because it is so tight.
"It is fine for a few cards, but I have several cards and this doesn't hold all of them. The description of the product is accurate so this is my own fault. I thought I would be able to cram a few more cards than advertised but that ended up not being possible."
Sizing is off by 3. Other than that. Looks as posted
I Love It But Its Slight To Small In The Arms To Wear As A Long Sleeve. And Its A Tight Fit. I Am 5'7 And I Wish I Would've Ordered A Large Instead But Nonetheless Its Cute Tied Around My Waist
"Expensive for plastic, but will serve it's purpose for a costume prop."
Probably would not recommend this as the hair is too thin. They could have used half again as much and charged a bit more. That would have made it a worthwhile purchase.
Dead ringer for mini Boden buuuuuut corners are cut with fabric quality. Thats fine for me right now- I have babies under 3 so I spend my money on smocked clothes. I use these for daycare and play clothes- it won't wreck me if ketchup or paint stains it. When they grow out of precious baby clothes Ill transfer the budget for smocks to Boden clothes- they simply last longer and resell!
The dress fits nice but I have long arms and the sleeves are kind of short.
"I was disappointed that this shoe is not comfortable right out of the box. The straps are very stiff and kind of sharp feeling. Hopefully, they will soften up as I continue to break them in. But, I don't like having to break shoes in a little at a time."
"Cute clogs & love the color but my son is always in between on the sizing.  He wears a size 10 shoe but these are too large (clog 10-11) and the size down (clog 8-9) is too small.  I wish they'd offer whole sizing instead; 8, 9 , 10, 11, etc.  I feel like customers would have a better chance of finding a fit.  My son has always wanted a pair but it never works out!"
"Returned these shoes - too wide~!  Otherwise, I would have liked them very much."
The big problem : I can't open it! So I can't wear it....
"This was 1 size smaller than other Keens [Newport, Arroyo} I have liked.  The sole is not made for much out of water walking."
I like them but they were alittle small and felt like it was sliding off down to my heals
This is a great jacket but be careul when ordering. I first ordered a size large for a man that usually takes a medium. It was too small. I had to order an XL. So that was 2 sizes up. I thought I was being safe the first time. My opinion is ordering 2 sizes up.
"I like it
Cost is very high"
Very nice but really small more for like kids not for teens
Expected better for cost.
Too big. Didn't do much
too thiick
"I bought these knowing they would be tall, but oh man. They're fun for a while but if you know you are going to be standing for multiple hours then I suggest something lower and more cushion. With that said, I love the cork and nude together and wear them a lot because they match almost everything."
"I was looking for a casual watch to wear when not working so I could minimize the wear and tear to my more professional / expenisve work watch.  I saw this watch at a large national retailer recently for only $30 so I decided to take a gamble on it.  I haven't owned it long enough to tell you how it will hold up.  Overall, I like it so far.  Personally, I think it may look better without the white Tachymeter writing on the bezel, but that is justmy opinion.  It is a casual watch and I do feel a little bit like I am wearing a high school kids watch given the appearance.  That being said it seems like a decent casual watch.  The hands / dial of the watch glow for a very short time when exposed to light, but the indiglo feature is great.  The watch looks really cool when the outline of all the dials and hands are lit up in the dark.  If you don't have good eye site (or glasses) the dials will be hard to read.  They are functional, but for me more decorative.  I won't use the features of the watch other than telling time, date, indiglo.  I may use the alarm, but it isn't likely.  I think the watch is a decent size.  The leather band is thick but I found it comfortable.  Again, to me it is a more casual or sport watch... a little but of a youth watch, but I still kind of like it.  If you can find this watch for under $45 then I say go for it."
Super cute but not for us...we needed a wider shoe and these weren't even regular in my humble opinion.  So if your childs foot is slim...these should work out fine but mine aren't and so these were wasted money.
This product runs smaller in size.  Had to send back and order next size
"I ordered two of these, one for each of my daughters to wear on 50s day at school. One was perfect, but the other had a rip in the seam of the skirt. I didn't have time to send it back, so I mended it the best I could. They were both very wrinkled, but you have to expect that from any costume like this that comes in a box. I used a steamer to steam out the wrinkles, and they looked very nice once I was done. I am not sure how other people have gotten the hats to stay on, but I wound up sewing them to headbands. There really is nothing on the hat to help pin it in your hair. For what I paid, I was okay with the costumes. My daughters looked adorable in them when all was said and done."
"I wanted a tote / purse that would be nice to carry extra items.  This is sort of a cross between a large purse and a small tote.

This is a lightweight, thin bag that has a somewhat leather-like feel to it.  It has a texture with bumps on it.  I do like that it zips up, which is a must for my bags.

The end of the zipper is not attached to the bag, so if the zipper pull is near the end, you have to use a hand to hold the end of the zipper and then pull on the zipper pull, which is not the easiest design.  Also once you have zipped the bag, there is a strap that crosses over the top of the bag and slips in the middle of the metal ""H"".  I wish instead this was just a magnetic closure, as it is too much work to do two enclosures with two hands.

The bag is nice to have for extra items when I don't want to use a regular grocery store tote bag or that kind of thing.  This isn't a heavy duty bag, so I would save it for lightweight items, maybe a book, microfiber towel, that kind of thing.

I received this bag in exchange for my honest review."
Pouch nice. Weight thought would be heavier for the price. Weight of the Disney's ponchos cost  $10
Nice looking ring but not durable the pins that hold them together fell out I am contacting the MFG to Replace.
Nothing special about these.
"size fits okay, but I did not realize they were more of a ""hip hugger"" than waist and I like the latter so can wear a belt"
"I bought two of these naval rings. I love the way this looks on, however the screwball broke in half on one ring within a week. I cant afford to go through one ring a week no matter how great it looks on. Sadly, I won't be purchasing this item again."
Should be called super-skinny pants.  I recommend you purchase these pants about a size or two larger than what you'd normally wear.  The pants are stretchy and really hug the leg.  Really nice pants though.  Will return for a larger size.
i should have ordered size up
"I would have put 4 or 5 stars except setting the date mechanism is beyond us!  However, it's a nice watch, easy to wear.  The strap has many holes set both for people with smaller and bigger wrists than I do (and I am a larger person)."
Does not provide the support I expected.
The dress is Extremely cute however it is a tad bit tight!
"I didn't expect the stripes to have metallic threads. I wanted plain classic old school tube socks, not shimmery socks. Still, they seem to be well made. I plan to gift them to my friends 12 year old. I'm sure she'll go crazy for the shimmer."
bought for my husband and unfortunately they are too small.
Noice sunglasses however they're really tight.
"I am 5'8"" 130lbs and this suit was too short for me in the torso making it unwearable.  Too bad, it's a cute suit."
"Pretty and larger than expected.
However, does not exude ""quality"" costume piece so even though I bought this reduced price, it still seems over priced. Made in China tag matches my disappointment.  Very thick backing says cheap!
Nice for a young person but not a serious gift idea."
"The boot itself is a great boot. The reason for the 3 stars is because they fit very small. I normally wear a 7 or a 7 1/2, but these fit like a 6. I returned these and bought the next size up. The 8 is just big enough. Wish they had half sizes :("
"The material makes it look sort of band uniformish. It looked better in the photo. But, it's alright. I'll wear it."
"These shoes are adorable and the color is fantastic and bright. However, they are not as comfortable as I would expect for the price and quality of the shoe. They are stiff and while I can wear them for a couple of hours, I am constantly aware of their presence on my feet - a low rating in my book. Great shoes fit well from the start and do not need ""breaking in"" to be a better shoe. That's a misconception about shoes I do not believe."
they were a little tight around the waste but they were very soft!
"Cute necklace. You get what you pay for. No regrets. Note of advice, if you want the necklace to lay flat as the picture shows you need to wear it as a choker. I tried to wear it about mid point upper chest area and the top string would not lay flat. The resin beads would flip over. I would say the last 25% of the extension part of the chain will keep the necklace from laying flat. I think because it's so wide it can't go too far down the chest without buckeling. I got nice compliments and another woman borrowed it on my vacation. I actually purchased it for a vacation for a specific outfit. It worked great and worth the price even if I never wear it again. But I think I'll try to wear it again. I just have to find the right outfit."
Runs about a size and a half too small but other than that... very cute!
"This shirt is really long, but not overly big in the shoulders and bust. Glad I went up a size to a 2X. I really don't know what I was thinking buying a linen shirt? So this was my bad and not so much the actual garment. Linen is an unforgiving fabric...and I hate ironing or steaming."
"...you need to know what it was made for.

I took this to England and quickly discovered two things: one, the 30l stated capacity is misleading as they include the theoretical capacity of every pocket in that, you will only get 1000 cu inches or 16 liters in the main pouch, and two, the numerous external pockets(and ultra! American styling) were the honey to pickpocket bees everywhere I went(Waterloo station was the worst.)

In the air, as a single carry on travel bag, its' nemesis is weight limits. I could have gotten all my stuff in it but AirNZ limits bags to 28lbs. it held 34 easily.

In America, or in school, none of that should be an issue, assuming you can get past the ""EXTREME!"" styling. It's well built, with nice thief approved smooth silent zippers, and comfy straps. It will cart up to a 17 in laptop and a tablet in the padded back compartment(each get their own section) with room to spare."
"Runs small, sleeve's were really short."
"Good product, a little bit wide"
"I bought this lovely set to wear to my daughter's wedding.  However, when I took the necklace out of the box, the chain had a knot in it.  :(  Now I will have to take it to a jeweler to see if he can get the knot out.  Otherwise, the set is beautiful."
"This is the first pair of Encore Breeze I have ordered in over 10 years (more like 15). Did they change the style or something? They used to cradle my foot in comfort, they used to stay on my foot! Now the back seems to have gotten smaller/shorter and my foot keeps flopping out of the back. The size of my foot has not changed, the only thing I can think of is that the back part has gotten ""lower""... Anybody else have this issue? Since I find keeping these formerly great shoes on my feet, a big distraction, they're going back. Gave 3 stars because the front part of the shoes is still very comfy. But for $90 that's far from good enough. Back they go."
This also fits as expected and like my other orders they have plenty of color choices.
"I wasn't crazy about the fit. The legs were a bit large. I wasn't crazy about the fade either, it looks dirty. It seems to me these jeans would be best for small butt, big legged girls."
"I ordered this in a size 10 after reading the other reviews, I normally like my hoodies a little bigger to wear long sleeve shirts under so I go for a large. I probably could have gone for a 12 in this one. 10 fits with room in the belly but the arms are kind of tight once a long sleeve is under."
i bought an extra large because most dresses from asia fit smaller. i am very hippy and have a smaller upper. i wear a size 10/12 dress. the bottom of dress fit well but the top had extra material that bulged in the back. will have to get it altered.
doesn't look much like hair.
The zipper came apart when I zipped the dress up.
ran small...for a child under 5.
"Even after washing many times,  these are still stiff and scratchy. Not really good for a 3 year old with mildly sensitive skin."
"Fairly comfortable, though the straps are very thin. Somehow I missed that there  is no padding in this bra. I will keep because it fit well."
"It's cheap but it jingle jangles and that's why we're all here, am I right? It was a gift for a belly dancing class for my cousin."
It wasn't as cute as i expected it to be
I'm sure this dress would look great if you get the right size. I returned mine because it was too big for the size that I would usually wear.
"The pants are fine, and the size is as expected.  The shirt is way too small and is nothing like the picture.  It looks like a womens shirt and size."
This shoe didn't hold up in the heel area.
I ordered my normal 38 because i am a 7.5 and have worn 38s in other alegrias but these were to large. Very comfy on the foot bed and great fun pattern but they kept slipping up and down my heel and I knew that i would not be comfy all day
"I have 2 pair of Ideal Fit Dockers shorts that I had purchased previously,  a couple years ago I would guess. I really did love how they fit, so I went looking for another pair. I bought a size 10 which is the size that I have in one pair but when I received the shorts, I could barely put them on and they were so tight through the legs I knew they would not work.  I returned the shorts and got a size 12 and while the shorts will work and I know they will stretch a little bit after I have worn them, they are still a little tight considering I went up a size. They seem more like the shorts version of skinny jeans. The cut and fit of the Ideal Fit Dockers has changed considerably and I know longer find the fit to be ideal!"
Runs Large
I like the size and look of this bag. I do not like the handles. They are very stiff and are difficult to get comfortable on my shoulder.
"Love the dark gray color and the style of the shoe with heel height is sexy, but the shoe runs a bit small!"
The design and shirt replicates the picture. Just the make of it is cheap with strings hanging. The ties that holds things together are too long. Fair overall
Very flimsy can't remove wrinkles. Disappointed.
"These boots are very narrow, when you first put them on. They need a little breaking in. And the quality is just ok. cheap boots."
"I like a lot of support and this is a ....light to moderate bra,comparative to the built in bras in a cami.  I get more movement than I prefer. If I am doing something light maybe but I never wear this bra to my heavy Aerobics or even my Zumba classes. I would be all over the place. I don't think I would buy this again."
Color is definitely not like pictures way more lemon lime than lime green ordered lime green not even close to pictures that are showing on here way more yellow than green beware
Got an 8 my foot isn't consider wide but isn't slim either but I would recommend going a half size up just to be on the comfortable side.
i was not a super fan of this tank...its ok its pretty snug but it is one size. it is very stretch but the fabric snags so easily...it was all snagged up after one wash./
"Too dark, almost black. This was cheaper but should have ordered navy not dark navy"
looks cute but way to narrow
"The bow is barely sewn on. The legs roll up constantly. The top won't stay tied. The bra inserts are oddly shaped, very disappointing"
"I got this pair for my daughter who wears size 13/1. She had complained about the metal ends that holds the studs in the back She would have loved to wear it as she loves heels and this matches my shoes but this the fit on what we receive was more like a 12.5 as it was tight in the front. However, the material is nice. It's shinny and perfect for a girl who loves heels."
"Well, it took 2 months to rip them off. Stink like hell. All threads are torn. Get something better quality if you want to wear at least season those for juniors. They run like crazy."
Its cute but I have an issue when it comes to zipper because you can't unzipped all I need to do is just step on it when I wear it
"Very cool look, but they are very narrow. I ended up not really being able to use these."
This shirt/pants is ADORABLE! I was sent a smaller size than I ordered so I will be returning..  maybe I can order again and get the right size.
After certain uses little fibers pops up.  Feels like wearing fiber glass used for houses. I would not recommend. 3 for the style.
"I ordered the small and it is still quite a large, bulky box.  It only accommodates a necklace and earrings, so no place for a bracelet and/or ring.  I find it very large for just the two items.  The chain to the necklace has no place to go except to hang down and wrap around. you can't pull up the flat piece to put the leftover  chain.  Not for me.  I was in St. Maarten and they gave me a great little box about 4x4 that held my pendant, earrings, and ring.  I then circled the bracelet around the edge of the box.  I sure wish I could find some of those.  Great if all you want is to present a necklace and earrings.  I do not recommend it for storage of a set, especially if you don't have a lot of space."
"The pattern is not bad.  The material seems good.  It's pretty loose around the hips, though."
I thought it would be softer from the look in the pictures. It is a nice length and color though.
It was okay.  There was no shape to the waist.  It was a little boxy.
It was the color I wanted & the fabric was very soft but unfortunately it was way too long for me. I'm 5'4 & it came down to the middle of my shins. Wish it fit because it seemed to be greatb in quality
"They did their job, but the blue rubbed off on one of my lighter-colored shirts. I figured out that I should only allow dark colors to rub against the sides until they can be laundered. I found the large size ideal for packing dresses and my bottoms."
Too stiff....hurts my feet ....cannot wear them. I think they are pretty and exactly what I wanted as far as looks go.
This is a good buy but the arm band was too small. It didn't state what size the band is so I assumed that it would be standard adult. In the description of the merchandise they should inform the buyer what the action size is or at least state if it's a men's or teenager or state a wrist size. other than that it is a good buy for the price.
Fairly nice glasses. Quality not all that good depending on the intended purpose.  It fits me well though.
"These are a cute shoe, but I ordered a 1/2 size larger based on reviews and I should have just ordered my size. They ended up too big and the quality was not what I was looking for so I ended up donating them."
"I ordered a size up because of reviews, but it was too big. And it was not soft at all. Even after washing and putting in dryer it was scratchy, and still too large. I put it in my donation bag. The only good thing was the beautiful blue color!"
runs big!  Great skirt
Well made but too big around and not long enough.
"The material is nice and stretches well without being constricting, but the stitching of the seams is inconsistent. One pair out of the six I ordered were worn once, washed once and immediately tore along the seam underneath the crotch. The other five are still holding up after a few weeks of wear, but the fabric along the seams of a couple of pairs overlaps far more than on the rest. I also find the legs to be too short. These are much more ""brief"" than ""boxer"". Overall, they're not terrible, but I'm already looking for longer replacements."
"I got this watch and it looks great and kept perfect time for about three days.  The chronograph functions all worked correctly during those three days.  On the fourth day, I noticed that when using the timing function, the second hand didn't return to the 12 o'clock reference position when reset.  I tried following the directions in the manual to reset the reference position to 12 o'clock, but nothing happened.  It now comes back to slightly past 6 o'clock when reset.  The fact that they have a procedure for reseting the reference point suggests this might be a common problem.  The watch does still keep time well, but I use the stopwatch function a several times a day and need it to work.

Called the factory and they said it needed to come back to them for adjustment.  They didn't even verify that I had tried the procedure in the manual for resetting the reference point. As is the case with most customer? service centers these days, I could hardly understand the person on the phone and he wasn't any help.  I decided to return the watch instead of trusting the service people to fix it. If they are going to put timing functions on a watch they should work longer than three days.easy a

As always, Amazon's return process is pretty easy to navigate and I've had good service on the few returns that were needed."
"The jeans were great quality, just not the right cut for me. They seem to be extremely long and large bell bottom. Seems the measurements do not match the size chart at all.  A big difference.  Too bad, as I said they were a nice looking jean."
"I need a pair of shoes to wear to a wedding, and these shoes did the job.  They are a bit snug in the toe."
"The outside is nice and appears to be pretty well made and I really like the color.  However, the inside feels like cheap plastic and it not very well made as it started splitting as soon as I opened it.  Just do not have time to deal with sending it back so will use it until I find a better replacement."
This shirt was a lot thinner than expected but the size fit as expected and would buy a thicker material next time.
"This sweater looks a little shabby and cheap after the first wear/wash. Most of the stuff I get from them is really nice, so I will keep trying more of the brand."
"Thinner fabric than expected. Mittens soaked through within 5 minutes of snow play as there is no water resistant lining. Adequate for traveling to and from your car, but you'll want a much warmer hat for outside walks or play if it gets below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Fit was as expected on my toddler."
"This shoe will be alright for those used to padded zero drop shoes, but for those used to no padding at all it feels like too much.
The toes box shape is nice and wide, but the toe box overly tall in size 15, which fit my 14 foot. I could wear heavy wool socks in there and it still would be too tall for my feet.

Also because the bottom is not flat it inhibits feeling the road with your toes. So while the shoe is technically zero drop, it's not really in application as the front portion is tapered. This is the same on all of the so called zero drop padded running shoes.

I bought some Soft Star Primal RunAmocs instead, ahhhhhh sweeeet !

The shoe runs 1 size small in the large ones at least. I called Top and this is what they recommended and they were correct."
Poor quality with bad smell
its nice for the price but the latch on band looked a lil beat up.
"I ordered 10 2E but was sent a 10 wide.  Not wide enough.  I returned them.  Amazon told me they did not have a pair of 10 2E to send me as a replacement, even though I could see them available on their site.  Today (months later) I can still see 10 2E in that color as available.  Not sure what the deal is but I found something similar elsewhere.  Their loss."
"The shirt is extremely thin. I am not returning it, but I wouldn't purchase another"
Happy with product however leather separating from rubber sole. Lasted 1 year
"So the item runs extremely small and i ordered a size up. Definitely go by their size chart and not your normal size. The product is extremely good quality for the price. Once my return is completed i will be ordering another in the proper size
Edit i reordered and ordered black unfortunately they sent hot pink and the quality doesnt appear to be as nice as the black. Returning"
Does not fit my 11 year old like I expected it to.
Not as full as pictured. It was effective minimally under the dress I had in mind for it but it still worked. It would have been nice to have it be a bit fuller though.
Top has a different fit to it as far as the sleeves go.  I like the tops that don't have the shirring.  this works for under a sweater.
Ordered up a size as recommended and i had to enlist the help of my friend to get me into it. Couldn't pull it up over my butt. I was fine in it once I had it on but this bathing suit is no good if the chance of my ripping it is 99% trying to get it on. Returning.
"like the shoe but a bit to small, I am a size thirteen but should have gotten a 14. Currently not wearing and will be donating them to one of the charities that collect clothing. I like to look of the shoe and compared to the shoes that they are asking anything over $60.00 this shoe measures up. Not the size but the shoe seems to be well constructed as well as having a nice look. They did feel comfortable but on my feet they were just a bit tight."
Looks good for the money.
"Doubt it'll last past first use out. My bottom hems weren't even sewn. I won't be even able to wash it. I'm 5'9"", 150lbs got a M. I'm also a cup, so some how top was tight. V shape ended at knees and hem infront half way down thighs."
Will send back for next size
"the look of the shoe is nice, and the material is light and sturdy. But the sizes are misleading. I would recommend going up a size."
"Great appearance, convenient strap on handle for hanging and nice leather handle. I only gave it 3 stars because the horn is attached to the inside of a spring by only pressure fit. It will detach if it is hard to extract it after use. It is simple enough to re-insert it, but that should not be necessary. My recommendation to the manufacturer is to attach the horn in a more secure way."
Nephew loves it; however the band is already showing signs of ware and tare and it has not been that long since purchasing it. I would buy another bc the nephew loves it so much.
Just too much going on...
They fit really well but their grip on the bottom is literally felt. Pretty tricky for people who are clumsy like myself!
The black dye was all over my feet and was hard to remove. I ordered my normal size but they are a little too big.
"The watchband itself is more than adequate, and looks good on the watch for which I purchased it. But when it arrived, the plastic case the product came in was cracked, and the pins which ordinarily come with a new watchband were missing.

These things in themselves are no big deal, but they made it obvious that this was not a new item. I'm guessing it was a return, but there's no way to know, because the vendor - Amazon itself - didn't say so.

If I had known that, I probably would have bought it anyway, but the fact that it was not mentioned made me lose trust for Amazon."
"I think the center seam going straight down the front makes it look like I'm wearing it backwards, but turning it around so the V is in front leaves a lot of camisole showing so it's not a great look either. I may wear it that way with a corset, but can't envision a whole lot of other opportunities to use it.

I'm 5'2, 150#, size 12, and a large fit well."
"This is pretty, but maybe a little more expensive than it should have been.
It looks nice, but it is part of a gift, so I don't know how the quality is yet."
"I typically wear a size 9.5 in Clark""s shoes and ordered a 9.5 in this shoe. I regret i did. When i tried them on, the toe box was tight and unforgiving. I tried to wear them to work, thinking i needed to ""break them in"", but that didn't help either.... I'm not sure if the sizing is off on this shoe or what. This hasn't discouraged me from buying more Clark's."
"I like the idea of these.  I put them in the shoes I wore to the airport recently and loved the ease of slipping them on and off through security.  They feel too loose, however.  They are looser than I like to wear to work and I think running with them is going to be a no go.  The tool they came with to help get the laces through the holes is totally useless, but I was able to get them through without it."
Average at best. Good to wear around the house
"A similar product from another companylasted 9 months (try to swim 5 days/week for 45 minutes). This one in about 3 months. Nice fit, comfortable, not overly tight but I am already in need of replacing it. Last one was O'Neil I think. Tighter, stronger material, but lasts longer.."
"Fit perfect, quality excellent except I do not like the feel of the material against me. Reminds me of sandpaper feel inside, even after a few washes."
Really nice but seems larger than a 1ct. Also very thin band which makes me feel like it's more obviously fake.
These could almost stand up on their own!! I guess the upside is they will probably take longer to wear out... they are really stiff as a board!!
"This is a cotton polyester blend, eyelet.  Cute but runs small.  So the advice given previously was correct.  Order one or two sizes large.  I'm 5 foot 7 and it is about knee length which is difficult to see in the photo.  I thought it would be longer.  it is sheer"
I normally wear a size 6 but ordered a 5 due to reviews. One shoe fitted perfectly but the other was too big which is weird because they were both the same size. The package did include shoe inserts so I will use those for the one that was bigger. They also included a shoe bag which was nice.
"I bought these identical (supposedly) socks in the past and reorder another pair, but these socks are different than the others. They have a blue line around the toe and seem to be thinner and shorter????  They fit good, but the others were better quality?  What's up???"
"I ordered the medium in white. It fit like a large. I'm 5'2"" and 34C. Not very flattering since it's not curved at the waist. The picture doesn't show the shirt as see through but it is. Even loose fitting on me, I could still see my bra. Very mediocre."
I love the looks of the boots online but in person there was something just a tiny bit off.  The ankle hole is way too large making them look a bit clunky and making it difficult to wear jeans without them bunching up about the tongue of the shoe.  Also the arch area seems to pooch out a bit making the boots look too wide.  The leather is a bit stiff but otherwise appears to be of a nice quality.  I have some other Clarks Artisan boots which seem to be of a nicer quality and are far more comfortable so these were a bit of a disappointment.  I do like the shading and the grey is a beautiful color.  If I hadn't purchased them at such a low price I'd probably return but as it is I don't have any grey boots so I'll hold on to them.
"It's always hit and miss with button up shirts for me, a woman with a bit larger chest. This was a miss. And the style doesn't allow for having that many buttons open on top with a layer underneath. Returned."
"These shoes are cute and comfortable! They work with a dress or pants, office or pleasure!
However, the very first time I wore these, after about 3 hours I took them off and my feet were black from where the material dyed my feet! I immediately washed my feet, with soap, and only about half of the dye came off. Now, I have black strap marks on my feet. Not very happy with that!!!! I have owned lots of Danscos and have never had this happen!!! :("
"I ordered a 10 based on the size chart. It fit well in the waist (I have a 31"" waist) but was too big in the top (I have a 35"" bust)."
"Very nice shoe from a design standpoint, but very little durability. It almost broke apart in a couple of month of intensive wear."
"im 5'3, petite with a 32 D bust and I ordered a small.  The coat fit but if i zipped it it was very tight across my chest. If  you are above a C cup id suggest ordering a medium and up."
"I ordered a 9 size which is what I normally wear. I should ordered an 8 , it was huge even when I have others pairs of corso como that fits pertect."
"I've purchased metallic puma shoes before, which are incredibly comfortable for long walks, so I figured I'll be getting the same thing thing. No so!
These look great, I get a lot of compliments, but they have no cushion.
My feet hurt after wearing them for a few hours.
I bought half a size up but that's not enough space put in gel inserts. I suggest you buy an entire size up for that."
Tend to slide off my feet.
"Its nice I like it, but its too big looks almost like a mens ring."
Ran small.  Returned it.
"the boots arrived quickly, they had a very heavy odor but that went away fast, one shoe feels a bit wider than the other but over all the boot is comfortable and I was glad I had them for my winter event."
dont work all that well
"So these are lightweight and squishy which is great.  I ordered the 5 and the 6 on Prime Wardrobe so I could find the right size.  I wear a 5.5.  But there are no half sizes.  6's were too big, particularly too long in the toe area. The 5's were a little tight but I went with it.  Tight as in the thong portion between the toes pulled a bit.  These were great for awhile until I walked home from the store a mile from my house.  The straps where they meet on the instep (top of the foot) sit right on top of a vein in my foot.  From walking that distance it put so much pressure on the vein that it injured it and now I have a nasty bruise on the top of my foot.  Not nice. I think if they had a 5.5 it would have been the better fit.
I got the tan sole with tan straps color and it's pretty.  I like how they look."
"Very cute and works but some color is already fading so it isn't very high quality. I also wish more colors were available, like a baby blue."
I had to return this pair of shoes as they were too big.  Return process was very simple and efficient.
Just tried them on.  How can one give decent review on clothing w/o wearing for awhile?
"Very comfortable BUT when you first wear these, they will dye your feet right where the straps are.
It's freaky when you go to take them off. Just be aware. Once they've dyed your feet, they won't do it
(that much) on any future wears."
The bottoms are good size but the material is thin so I ended up wearing 2 bottoms. Also you have to try and figure out how to tie the top. No instructions or guide!
I love the style and design but I had to transform into a necklace piece because they are extremely heavy and hurt the ears after a day's wear.... still get compliments on the piece....maybe a replica a little lighter for the ear lobe would be great!!
"Definitely geared toward larger heads. I wear a 7 1/4 hat, so I'm between a Med and Lg in most hat ranges, and this thing goes down my nose, even when pulled all the way to my neck in the back.

If you wear L/XL hats, you should be good to go. If you wear Med or smaller, look elsewhere.

That said, the material is good. Warm without being suffocating."
Fit small had to return
"I love my regular FitFlops. These are cute but the back strap is weird. I am a 9 but even with the strap as small as it will go, it is still so loose that I can slide my foot in. I guess I would recommend going down a size. Otherwise comfortable."
They are way to small pretty uncomfortable and feel cheap. I bout a pair at Walmart for 14.99 that look 100 times better than these and also fit better
It's a really pretty top but I wished there were more material on the top and sleeves. I didn't feel too comfortable in it.  I don't mind showing cleavage but I had to be careful because the shell of my bra was showing which I thought was weird fur a plus size top.
This is a great parasol for Jolly Holiday Mary Poppins. However there is not way to stop the parasol from sliding open when not extended and out. Had to add on a ribbon with Velcro so it would stay when down.
I'm a size 6 to 8 petite and the S/M in this poncho barely fits so go up in size if you prefer more room.  Not the best quality but will work for throwing on with jeans on the weekend versus a sweater.  Soft and nice tan color.
I ordered a size M in the color black (I'm not sure if there are other color options). I was debating between a S and a M because I tried on a similar item at Express and the small fit just right. But after reading reviews about the neck piece being tight and the sleeves being short I went with medium. I wish I hadn't though. I am a 34D and I weigh 126lbs (and I have a small neck) but I like my clothes to fit snug. The bottom of the shirt doesn't hug my midriff and the sleeves are still short and they aren't tight around my wrists. The neck piece is also too big now. I am hoping that after washing and drying it will shrink a bit. It fits exactly how I expected a medium to fit... I just should've gone with a small. But overall it still looks great. (I may attach a photo at a later date).... Also! I just realized that the size is M/L. The tag says it but online it didn't. So I have to assume the small would be xs/s.
The H3 wasn't that bright. Also the wrist band broke.
"I still like the jeans, however they fit a little loose....where it counts the most. The jeans could have been more form fitting. Then I would have given it 5 starz....."
They fit comfortable but really don't like the squeaky noise they make when I walk.  Other than that it would have gotten a 5 star.
"It feels kinda cheesy, but a least it fits. Could've use more support around the mid section, but still covers ""problem"" areas.

Not a fan of the loose threads, but c'est la vie."
"They were too big, so I gave them to my daughter. I tried to follow what other reviews advised, but they were still tool big. I normally wear a 6 , so I should have purchased a 6. Next time I'll know!"
"this is a nice quality belt,"
"I got these for my daughter and they are waaayyyy too big. I have a different model of adidas that I like very much, but these are not as padded. She likes them for gym class so I'll be exchanging for ha half-size smaller."
Very small earring
"Cute blazers, but the sizes are off.  I ordered 2 colors in the same size, and one of them was too tight to button and the other was way too big!"
"This is a beautiful wallet, and great quality.  However, while the photo indicates that a passport will fit in the zippered portion, it only BARELY fits, if you stuff it in there, and then you can't get the zipper back open once it is in.  I had a moment of panic when I realized my passport was stuck in the wallet and I was not sure I would get it out without destroying the passport cover.  In the end, I returned it.  This would be a great buy for use domestically, not a good buy for international travel use."
Item was beautiful! I could not wear because it was uncomfortable for me.
The material gets caught on the teeth of the belt latch so it isn't as easy to take off and its longer than I would like.
"Like the style, fabric and cut but the seams ripped right away."
"at first, it was great and comfy, but after start walking I felt like the right pair has a small stone inside or bump inside it which is annoying while walking.

and I could not request for a return because of the high cost of international shipping :(

but in general the material and manufacturing is excellent"
I did not like how this does not have any padding at all.
A lot larger than expected. My daughter just turned two but she won't be able to wear these for a while
"I like the looks of the shoe but they stretched out after two wearing's. I wish I wore them around the house more, I would have returned them."
"I like it, but.... it is a little tight.  Maybe my calves are a little too large?"
"I like these and it's really hard to find nylon panties but they aren't holding up very well. It does say they recommend hand washing, but that is a little unreasonable, at least for me, so if anyone else chooses to throw caution to the wind and wash in a machine, they may not hold up long for you either. It probably wouldn't prevent me from ordering again though--sometimes when things like this are made, batches vary from one to another. I like to wear these under my work pants so I don't get panty lines."
Great item for gift bag
I am happy with this purchase - the sizes  of this purchase is disappointing
"I bought these to go with 1 specific outfit and they are perfect for that.  The shape is a bit weird, they don't ""fit"" as formed as I would like - as in the front of the shoe doesn't slope as close to my foot as I'd like, they are very wide, almost to the point that I was considering sending them back (granted I have a pretty narrow foot) and lastly the top edge of the shoe rubs badly on my leg.  I have to wear thick socks or make sure my jeans or leggings were to go inside them.  Also, you might want to put some insoles in them as the bottom is very hard, and provides no cushion at all.  All that being said, they serve their purpose and complete the look of my outfit so I'm happy  :)"
"These socks only last about 6 months. They fit well, and they are fairly cheap, but every single one had a hole in it by 6 months, which doesn't seem like a long time to me."
"the chocker looks good, but the broche is very cheap and hard to open."
"As others have said, the cups run big on this product. It's otherwise not bad. Reasonably comfortable."
"BEAUTIFUL shoe but I had to return them because they were too small. I wear a 8.5. Ordered a 9 due to other reviews. It was STILL too small. When I tried to get a smaller size, they were sold out. Even went so far as to contact the company directly. They discontinued the shoe. Who discontinues such a popular shoe?"
This shirt would rate 5 stars if it only had a pocket big enough to be useful.
Nice well madr
"Came quickly. basic tee, fits fine, i just wish the sleeves were shorter, but that's just me. I wanted really short sleeves to wear under another short sleeved top. Not a defect though."
"The bag is nice and big enough to fit all the essentials. However, the zipper is not secured at the end and is, therefore, hard to open, especially with one hand."
"Three stars, what can i say! I didn't give it 3 stars because the print wasn't cool. It just didn't fit. Even my boyfriend wanted to where em! but again they did not fit!!!!!!!!!

PROS:
great material
cool print
durable
sexy

CONS:
did not fit
runs small"
"Don't think this would last past one winter, the pro is its longer than the standard size version that goes to the XL. I went with the XL, but still unsure if I would keep the other one due to the extra material near the back puckering. I probably would have kept the 1x if it wasn't so much material left as since I have big boobs, this was a better fit, however I can get away with the XL"
These are comfy legging but didn't quite fit. I have a big booty and these leggings were see through in the butt! I was also looking for more of a spandex material and these are a blend of cotton and spandex.
"The belt is very nice but too small, if it was bigger I would have kept it."
"I absolutely love this brand of booties and its all my baby wears, but I wish I had known the regular knit ones run a size small compared to the fleece ones. We had 0-3mo in the pink fleece. I just received this black pair of 3-6mo and they are the same exact size. (See photo) I will try stretching the black ones when wet but these definitely will not last until my baby is six months old. I shouldve ordered 6-9 mo."
freaking love these but they run so small I doubt I'll ever fit in them
"I tried to use these for work, however the heel cause blisters. They're cute and would be comfortable for a short amount of time"
"Unfortunately, it arrived with a tear in the arm and because there wasn't time to return before Halloween, I sewed it myself. An easy fix, but when you pay for something you shouldn't have to. Overall it was really cute but the pants were a little too short and I wish they weren't a blue/purple velour type material. However, for just one evening, it did its job."
"These are really long.  I'm 5'3"" and they go down to the top of my thighs."
"I don't think this is minimizing my bust as much as it claims to. I am wearing a 36DD and it seems like the right size. Nevertheless, I wear this bra most days. It doesn't show under my button-down shirts or my more sheer blouses. It is comfortable and stay put."
These run wide for the brand. My daughter says that the shoes are not that stable.
"It says silver tone so I'm not sure of the exact make up of these, but I did expect them to at least not turn my ear black. I love the look of these and they don't feel cheap, but after wearing a few days, one of my ears had a reaction to them, turned dark and scabbed up. I am allergic to fake earrings and since most companies make hypoallergenic ones now anyway, I haven't had a reaction to an earring since grade school. I will maybe put some clear nail polish on the back and see if that keeps my ear safe because they are really cute, cheap, and I love the size of them."
"For the price it's ok , but it runs very small."
I love this brand but this style gives me terrible blisters!
"These are OK for the price.  The suede is rough, probably good for shoes but what i didn't like was the rubbery heel.  Would have been nices with  leather.  They fit a wide foot well though and i've worn them a lot."
The size is to big on me
They seem well made but fit weird. If out for a walk they just don't fit well around the hips and waist I ordered two pair but will donate both - spend your money on a little better pair
"Was not what I expected. This is more like an undergarment for pants, not stretchy legging pants that you can wear with shirt. I sent it back."
Waiting for winter
"They do their job, but there is more glare on them than on other night driving glasses.  Kinda defeats the point of the glasses.  But they do improve night driving and because of that I gave them three stars.  If had to buy again, I wouldn't.  In their favor, they make me look like Bono.  Which is cool.  So if your goal is to look like Bono, these are the glasses for you.  If you goal is to see clearly at night without eye fatigue, get something else."
"Ordered large, shorts fit well but top is very tight"
Fabric is stiff and uncomfortable and stitches were coming undone at hemline...not very good quality materials used.
"I loved this shirt and planned to buy more in different colors, but it seems to stain easily and two holes popped up pretty quickly without me doing much."
First of all the color is definitely not the same as listed on the web.  It's a dark plum color and not light lavender like the picture shows.  Also it's not a slouchy style and is more fitted when you  put it on.  It is nice and thick though and seems to be good quality.  I was just disappointed in the color :-(
Fabric is kind of cheap and lumpy.
it was ok. I didn't get the little wallet either.
SO SO...
"Cute purse, but smaller inside than I thought it would be  Hard to fit just the basics.  Okay for a luncheon or dinner where you only need your keys and phone, but not much else.  Kind of difficult to ""pry"" open the inside to add your items.  Nice to have the two straps for different wearings."
"I really wanted to like the dress more, but it is VERY stretchy and tight and sheer. If I really did wear this on my wedding day there's no way I could wear anything underneath it, but then you'd see that too! It is a very crisp white and soo pretty but it just doesn't look right. (That's just on me!). Size fit as expected."
"way too big for LARGE, sleeves are way too wide also,It feels like I had wings when I tried it one. Seller accepts return at your own expense, That blows. Quality is good though. TO  wear to I need to ate 10 burgers a day or NOT!"
I only wish that it came with it's own t-shirt as the front is pretty low and I had to put on a T-shirt but it showed so it did not look as good as it should have.
I ordered these in the same exact size I always wear in all my other Cole Haan loafers and this was too short and too narrow! GORGEOUS shoe! The sad thing is I was afraid to even order up a size because it was too drastic of a difference in my normal size. Again...a beautiful shoe!
i have a really large head and got the biggest size possible it's a bit snug but it does stretch a slight bit.
"Kid liked it. But, like most minecraft stuff, you're paying for the name, not the quality."
It's lightweight t-shirt material & easily becomes a bit baggy.  The color is nice.
"I wear a size 9W.  The width was great, but it was too long.  I didn't feel like they were big enough to try 8.5 W."
"It's a nice-looking robe.  However, even though the tag says ""Cotton"" it really appeared to be something else.  It's a very heavy material and a robe appropriate for winter and not a summer cotton robe, which is what I was expecting and wanted.  It'll just hang in my closet until colder temperatures arrive."
Shirt fit well but after three wears is already pilling.
"Color is not as vivid as shown, and the bust area runs small, even though i ordered one size up from what I usualy wear."
"ok, top entry is tight, works ok if you don't need to carry much in the purse part, otherwise things are pretty packed together"
The jeans did not fit-I bought several pairs of others the same size 4 m  and only these Lee were too tight
I don't know...maybe my build is just funky but doesn't look good on me at all. Choose correct measurements but fits awkwardly and is hard to walk in because its tight around the knees.
This bra is comfy but has no support.
"A little small, can not dry!"
I plan on returning this as it is too small for me.
"The fit of the dress is really nice, just as pictured. But the lace part looks cheap; like a middle school home economics project or something.  In some parts of the embroidery, the lace does not cover the white satin all the way, so some of the white sticks out on the side.  And on the bottom of my dress, the lace was not cut evenly, so the white sticks out there too.  I like how the dress is not too heavy.  It's really breathable and comfy.  But unfortunately I'm returning it.  I want something more elegant looking."
"too small; very thin, but it's really cute"
"First off, let me say I *do* overall like the shoe. It's an adorable style and the shoes are mostly comfortable. But I wore them to an outside event, and due to my heels keep getting caught in the walkway, the material on them were shredded by the end of the day. A little wear and tear, understandable, but completely ripped material? I had to cut, file down, and then paint the heels with blue nail polish to be able to wear them out again. (The rest of the shoe was fine!) For the price that Leg Avenue charges, I would expect a little better than this - not much! - but a little."
"Cheap and runs VERY large. Dirt shoes up very easily too, within a few wears of walking around they looked horrible."
"I love the shoe but it is a little to narrow in the toe area.  The heel is comfortable, the style is great, leather feels good, looks like a $50.00 shoe, HOWEVER, it is not a truly wide shoe.  If you have just moderately wide toes, this shoe is not for you.  I am using stretchers."
"On the tighter side, recommend ordering a size up"
Nice looking i had em for about 2 weeks and i use em for work . Not as comfortable as i was hopping . Arch support not as good as i had with my kswiss .
"Way bigger than I wanted, but it's my fault for not reading carefully."
"I ended up returning it. Why? Because the seam was sewn so crooked that the pelvis was off connection by an inch. It was so bad that the top of it looked confusing and you couldn't tell it was supposed to be a skeleton. I ordered a large when I'm normally medium just because of how snug leggings usually are and it had some extra material to it - I liked that. Also the material was thicker than normal leggings, and why I ended up ordering another pair with hopes that it won't look as bad."
Cute but too flat for me
"These leggings are extremely comfortable and are ""butter soft"". Beware that they do run small and may not accommodate any comfortably over a size 8 or 10. I will have to return them a they are not comfortable for my size 14 frame. I am also 4'11"" and the length it's perfect, so for those taller who want them to hit the ankle these may not work for you.

This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
"Returning it. 3T is definitely like 2T. I have too much clothes to compare (and 2 y.o. twins who can't fit into 3T). :)

Other than that it feels soft."
Color did not look natural.  A little pink
Lightweight.  Comfortable at first but not good for the long haul.  I think I would have been happier with a larger size -- and I did size up with this order!  Little arch support.  Cannot wear for more than 2-3 hours at a time.  Disappointed because they are cute.
"Quality is fine for these shoes, my main problem is they are a universal size, one size fits all.  I guess the manufacture does that for less inventory, but I'm a size 12, and it's was to small for my feet.  They ended up promptly in the Goodwill Store so they can benefit someone.."
loses elasticity quickly.
"I ordered a much bigger size than I needed =(  I was really disappointed, but my mom adored them; so Instead of returning I gifted them to her. Nice they were able to be of some use and I didn't have to go through a return hassle. Really loved how long they were ! would recommend, especially for taller gals."
"In general, I like this bra, although it's not quite as supportive as I had hoped. It feels like the fabric gives a bit as the day wears on, and I wind up needing to tighten it to get the same support in the afternoon as I got in the morning. This also means the garment needs to be washed after every wearing, which I hate to do with bras (I'm guessing most women would agree).

The bra is quite comfortable, however, and I appreciate the seamless structure and smooth fabric. It does hold sweat a bit more than all-nylon bras do, though, so not a great choice on a hot, muggy day. It's a bit of a full-figured bra, so it's not going to look great under anything really sheer--keep that in mind. I like it under t-shirts for casual wear and light exercise."
These fit very awkward and even the medium looked like a large on me. Not a flattering fit at all.
I had high hopes for this bag. I had a similar one for 3 year and my car got broken into and the purse stolen. My other one was made of different material it was the lesack regular with flowers on it. I wanted to get this black cricket material because I though it looked more elegant than the everyday patterned ones. I have problems because at seems there are treads coming lose and I tend to pull on them to fix it. See the pick attach. I need a purse and I can't wait without a purse for week to send it back and get another one. Just have to live with it for now. I don't know if the string is coming lose at the treads because of the material texture mixed and if it wouldn't of been better to get the original lesack material.
These are heavy duty and protect my toes nicely when I stub my foot into a boulder - the tread is very durable also - but do they have to be so big and ugly and heavy? I feel like a transformer when I put them on - and I wear a size 10. I do like the lace design - it never comes undone and it holds me feet in place on descents when usually other shoes allow my toes to crumple into the front
Good but not quite what I was hoping for.
"These are nice socks, ... however, they do not stay up as well as other socks of same length."
"I just sent these back. Nicely made, but the toe was unflatteringly long. Also, the foot bed was not cushy and felt a little hard. Nice leather, but the style is just not for me. The fit was fine for my US size 7.5 foot. This was one of those El Naturalistas on which I decided to size up."
"The black socks ruined my pedicure by leaving black dye on my big toe. However, they are comfortable and stay put. I am solving the problem by ordering a set of beige socks."
"Really cute watch. Love the face, but the cheap band fell apart after a few weeks... And I only wear it a few days a week."
"Could have been cute but ran small and was just okay,"
"The material was so soft, and maybe cus it was a little larger than my size, the top droops a little on the body. but still, nice for a very casual look."
"Fine looking robe but the sleeves were too short for my husband who usually takes a Large Tall.  Therefore, returned robe to Amazon."
"I've had these shoes for two and a half months. They fit great and the ""gel infused"" insole felt great (at first). After wearing these shoes 4-5 days a week the insoles have worn down to where there is a hole on the insole at the front ball of the foot. The insoles are glued in and not replaceable. It's a shame because for the first two months the shoes felt great."
"The material is weird... thick, synthetic & satin-y.  The print is good, though.  I thought it would fit weird on my American (pizza-loving) body (it's in ""Asian sizes""), but it's fine.  I usually wear medium-large in shirts, c cup, size 9 pants; I'm 5'4"" & 140 lbs."
Socks are much too tight around the ankles and cut off blood causing swelling.
Its okay but my girl is very petite and it was just a little too large.
My girls hate them because there is a tag on the inside near the waist that itches them all day. They refuse to wear them.
"feels ok, not impressed though"
Hat is of good value for the price and quality.  The only issue I have is that it fits a little weird even when pulling the adjusting straps which are hard to pull from within the hat.
NICE BAG BUT NEEDS POCKETS OUTSIDE.
The shoe is comfy is was in the smaller side of my shoe size and the sole is not strong if you plan on walking a lot mine starting coming off and did not last long I'm sad that shoe didn't last long
"Nice, but on the stiff side"
I felt that the band was tight on these and I purchase other Warner product the same size
was expecting a smaller fit and Less bagging fit on the legs
"Very sad to inform you that these were too small.  They seemed warm, strudy, not too bulky but still great for a snow storm.  But alas, they're too small"
"I have to say I was disappointed in this necklace. It is absolutely TINY! The chain is super thin as well. It could easily be ripped off with a small tug. might be a wise idea to do a comparison of size on the site so people are not disappointed when it arrives. One thing I do like is the color. It is a beautiful blue.

Specs: Small blue opal heart charm necklace with a floating pendant look
Charm Measures 0.4 inches, 1cm
Heart sits on a thin 17 inches, 43cm 925 sterling silver snake chain
Arrives in a simple yet elegant gift box
A romantic gift for women, wife, girlfriend or anyone special"
Too narrow for my foot.
Material was not what I expected. The pants were a couple of inches too long.
"odd length on me and I'm only 5'3, too short to stay tucked in properly and doesn't look right untucked"
"simple black skirt, definitely do not dry, it'll shrink right up!"
donated it to charity
"Based on the reviews as well as the size chart, I figured I'd be a large. That was not the case. It's a gorgeous skirt. It just needs a little hemming up on the length, but I can't even zip it up. Word to those who carry more weight in their stomach, you may want to go up a size. I'm hoping to shed some pounds and get it to fit, but may just end up getting it tailored. Wish it had a little elastic in the waist."
"This case was very small. I know they give dimensions, and I measured my clip on sunglasses, but they still didn't fit. The case is not very deep, either. So any kind of bend in the clip ons and they won't fit.  The quality of the case was great! The only problem I had was with the fit and the size."
"Expected better fit, always order my normal size"
"Very pretty, I've gotten several compliments on them & i can use my phone while wearing them. But they didn't keep my hands very warm."
"Much prefer the Dream Cotton Boyshort with Lace .  This version doesn't look as flattering, and tends to ride up more in the back."
"I liked these just wish I hadn't walked around a bit before realizing they are just a tad small.
They seem like they'd be great for the beach and summer in general, but order up a size. Like the contour fit to the foot."
"So delicate, afraid to use it too frequently. But it is gorgeous and perfect for special occasions."
Not my style but keeps the rain off.
"This shirt is pretty and I like the polka dot print. It's a light shirt that is loose fitting. The fabric is a crinkled slightly stretchy fabric, NOT the chiffon as stated in the listing title. Even so, the fabric doesn't bother me.

However, it's made for very narrow shoulders! Where the sleeves are.. actually sleeves on the model, they don't even touch the outside edge of my shoulders and I'm a small framed person. It looks funny on me, unfortunately. Maybe a size up would be better?

I received this shirt at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
According to the size chart I required a size XL.  Nope.  It's huge.  Not easily returned because I live overseas.
Would love if it fit!
"Stylish and sturdy as you need an everyday pump to be; perfect arch fit, ...but it's a tad small in the toe box."
"I would recommend maybe going down a band size, but the cup fit is good.  I am a 34H and purchased this for running.  It doesn't beat an Enell bra, but it will suffice if I wear it for shorter runs.  As long as you're not jumping rope or running, this is an excellent bra!  I'm keeping mine because there are still a lot of things I can do while wearing it."
"This Lucien Piccard Men's watch is very nice looking. It comes in a gorgeous and well made gift box. It has a classic and timeless look, it has gold, but not too much, and it has a genuine leather band. Unfortunately, there is a ""deployment clasp"" at the end of that gorgeous leather band that is a deal breaker and makes this watch unviable for everyday wear.

When the watch arrived, my Husband and myself were both pretty impressed with it. It was even nicer looking in person than in the pictures. My Husband immediately went to try it on. Then he said, ""What? I don't understand."" This made me stop what I was doing and come look because my Husband is the type of guy that figures everything out easily...especially mechanical issues. He showed me the clasp and I was confused too. We looked at the small instruction booklet and did not see anything about the clasp. After about 5-10 more minutes of tinkering with it, my Husband figured it out.

The clasp is a real pain to use. If you have a small wrist, you may be able to keep the clasp on the opposite end and save some time. However, my Husband has a large wrist. He has to take it completely apart every time. He also showed me how he has to ""guess"" which hole is right each time since you don't know if you have it right until it is all the way fastened. This is hard to understand without actually seeing the watch in action, but trust me that it is not worth your time. Even with my Husband knowing how to work the watch, it takes several minutes to put on. He will wear this watch occasionally, but it will be rare. He needs a watch that goes on in seconds, not minutes.

While this watch would probably get 5 stars without the clasp, the clasp will be a deal-breaker for most people. I do not recommend this watch. There are much more user friendly watches out there."
Ankles are loose
"Not the most comfortable shoe, but was a perfect match for Alice in wonderland outfit."
"I really really wanted these to work for me but they were just too narrow on my right foot. The box showed them as Extra Wide not 4E w - for me I have found that Extra Wide may mean 2E or 3 E and rarely fits me.  I need an honest 4E or even 5E. Otherwise the boots were light and had a good tread.  Construction quality wasn't real great tho, the left boot seemed to have an odd wave in the leather right at the instep.  It wouldn't have harmed performance of the boot much but it looked a little odd and caused me to wonder how well made they were. Sent them back - for the fit problem on my right foot."
It's not bad more of a deterrent !
"What can I say, they hold presentation boards nicely, but I have not yet started using them."
"Fits well, looked great , but stiching fell apart in less than 6 months. Never had Skechers do that on me before."
Actual colors are different than I was expecting but decent hat overall.
"Based on the reviews, I sized up (large). It doesn't fit quite well though. It's not tight/supportive enough. However, the medium (as I usually use in regular clothing) would have been a perfect fit I believe. I must note though that I do use a size large in the champion's absolute workout bra. (for reference, I am a 34B bra size - 144 lbs active person). P.S - Im using my boyfriend's account."
"My daughter loves these and they were cute on her when new, she was wanting them for over a year and I finally caved in to the ""twinkles."" I wish the front toe box on top was rubberized, it is a canvas material and shows dirt easily.  I am afraid to wash them yet or the twinkles may not work anymore.  I am not impressed with the wearing of the sole of the shoes, I think they are of the classic cheap ""sketcher"" sole.  I stopped buying that brand for my son as they just didn't hold up, the sole just completely wears away, so I stick with New Balance for him now and they hold up until he outgrows them.  I am not sure if I will buy these again because of the lack of durability...I bought these mid August for school to start and by mid October the soles are almost shot, and she has several other pairs of shoes she rotates these in with."
"The problem with this dress is the workmanship is very poor.  the material is pretty good but the neatness is not there.
i did expected a better job.  it does not look like the picture shown and it is very disappointed.  we buy because of the picture."
Shoes look better in the photo
I like the comments on the bracelet
No zipper pants. Size larger than normal.
"I ordered relatively inexpensive extra-large, long-sleeved T-shirts from Hanes, Gildan, and Soffe. All purchases were Amazon. I wanted a shirt to serve as a sleep shirt to pair with miscellaneous bottoms.

1. Washing. All three shirts needed two washings and dryings (med heat) to become reasonably soft and lose their chemical odor.

2. Country of origin: Two shirts are made in El Salvador, one in Honduras.

3. Neck label: Hanes had printed-on-cloth label; others had tags.

4. Sizing: Hanes was baggier and 1 inch longer than the other two. The extra length is good, at least for sleeping.

5. Texture: Soffe and Gildan had identical, somewhat stiff texture compared to the Hanes.

6. Cuffs: All cuffs were reasonably tight.

Conclusion: If you are simply looking for sleeping comfort, probably go with Hanes--though currently at $10.41 the most expensive of the three. If you are wearing the shirt out in the world, and aren't overweight and no taller than six feet, the fit is a little better with either Soffe or Gildan. Soffe is currently a buck-fifty cheaper than Gildan though with fewer color choices. Hope this was helpful."
"Fits small, otherwise nice looking, good materieal"
"In most clothing I wear a Medium. Based on the size chart for this item, I ordered the XL. It fits, but it's skin tight. The size chart doesn't allow for any wearing ease. The fabric is very thin and drapey, so it shows every bump or ripple of body imperfection. I'm passing this along to a thinner friend."
"this dress is right for me on June the 4th, the fabric was really nice I had another dress like this with the houndstooth from another company which I love so I tried this one the fabric also is very nice on this one but some of the stitching is over stitched so much so that is bunched up that's my only complaint with this I wish that you people would please look over your product before you send it out this dress could be great if it wasn't over stitch and have a different color popping out right in the front where you can see how / stitched it is, perhaps the sewing machine jammed or something but there's way too much reading and double stitching that should not be there"
My daugther had use them with no problem. I think are too small for her feets but she had run 4 track and field events with no problem or complaining. I think are too expensive for a running shoe.
"If you are a US Large, I suggest a XXX. I wear a large and ordered a XL. It just doesn't fit well. Too bad because the design is nice."
Really like the boots but disappointed in the quality of the zippers.  They stick and are difficult to pull up and down.  The outer zipper appears buckled. Not smooth.
"You get what you pay for here. They are dainty, comfortable and fair quality. I do not expect them to last as long as my cotton ones. I will not continue to buy them - I like underwear that hold up better and longer."
"Beautiful color, fairly comfortable heel, but run VERY large. My usual size 8  was too big even with TWO socks on. Possible a whole size down would have been ok."
"It's nice, smaller than what I thought it would be, I'm not sure if I like the way it looks on me yet. Only wore it our once."
"Dont like it really cheap looking, get what you pay for i suppose"
"The shoes seemed nice and well made, but they were by no stretch of the imagination ""wide width"". I came back to Amazon and purchased the High Heel Shoe Stretcher from Footfitter and I can finally wear these shoes."
es un color diferente
"I'm fairly large busted (d-cups), but I ordered a medium based on their size chart. I should've ordered a large."
"If you are looking for cheap, comfy yoga pants-go for it. If you are looking for maternity yoga pants, don't do it!!! These are not maternity pants. They have a small band that instead of folding over you can attempt to pull up but it does not cover the belly. They run very small."
Well made great price but to tight a fit for me but will fit one of my grandkids for ice fishing so all well
"I went with what other reviewers suggested and bought one size larger. My daughter was 9 months but I wanted them to fit for a while so I bought the 18 mo ones and they fall off constantly so I put them away until they fit. Dissapointed, I guess I should have bought the 12mo size but with the price I didn't want to buy another pair. I am satisfied with the look and quality though, so if they would have fit I would have given 5 stars."
"I'm so disappointed.  I wanted to love this boot.  It's really gorgeous.  But I bought it because the calf circumference for these boots as listed on the Frye site is supposed to be 13"".  I have very thin legs, my calves are about 12"" at the widest point so I am always on the lookout for a great skinny boot.  Well, I received these today and the circumference is more like 14.5"".  I already have black boots that are the same circumference and look too similar to keep these.  I really wish they were skinnier.  Like I said, they are simply gorgeous.  Buttery soft leather and great styling.  The zipper in the back is also nice.  It's a little hard to zip at first but if you flex your foot it makes it easier.  So back these go and my search for the perfect boot continues...."
"baggy at knees, and just felt very low quality - probably fine for taller girls and for novelty use only."
"it is a beautiful bra. lace design is flattering. somewhat uncomfortable, maybe because it is new. i will keep and hope it feels smoother after wash."
"I've worn only Birks for the past couple of decades. I wear Birks, Papillo, and Betula, cheap to expensive.  These are cheap. Flimsy, very flexible sole, all plastic/rubber man-made.  Feet don't breath in these and start to sweat the minute I put them on, even under the top strap. My foot angles kind of strange in this foot-bed; toes leaning towards the sides of the shoes instead of being held towards the front...hard to explain. It's like the foot-bed near the toes are angled inward so my toes angle sidewards. Not very comfortable for Birkis since my feet are accustomed to wearing anew pair right out of the box with comfort...not so with this pair. I'll try walking in them to hopefully have them adjust to my foot shape.  The good thing about these is you can wear them at the beach, in water, mud, what-ever and rinse them off. Good throw on shoes for when you don't care about wrecking them.

ETA: Sent this pair back and ordered one size larger (which I never had to do in all the Birks I've bought).  This larger size still has a some-what funky fit, a tad too long, but at least I can wear them around the house or going out in rain or mud.  I wish we still had a Birkenstock Outlet close enough to drive to...this one closed and the others are many hours away.

I'll post again after the break-in period and hopefully they will turn out to be a good shoe."
Its cute but it really squishes my boobs. Im not even that big chested and it flattens me out! I'm only a 36C. The material is stiff.
"These look like the photos and are two different clasps as shown.  But they do not fit a 16mm band, they are quite larger.  They are even a bit large for 18mm bands. They are also not both the same size as each other.  One is larger still.  I can still and use them for bands for my stainless gold watch, but it's unlikely.  I have a 22 gold watch and I might be able to mTh them to a band there but it's likely they will be small for those bands...  Otherwise quality is fine, and they were as depicted, exactly."
"Runs small on American sizes, the XL (Asian xxl) fit more like a skinny large. The button holes need to be attended to before it can be worn, a lot of extra threads. Over all not bad, but I would not to purchase again. Gave mine away to a friend."
"The tights were soft but big. my daughter is just into 2T's. If i realized these were going to be so big i would have gotten something closer to 18mths. BUT i find many labels for tights saying 2T-4T, which i really don't get. there is pretty big difference in size."
"The bag is a lovely size and with compartments inside so that's  pro, however it came packaged in compressed bag so the leather is lined from compact packaging. On opening and examining it the sewing is coming out on the bottom corner of front pocket,i expected better care when making bag. I will have to get it sewn to prevent detachment of pocket. It looks like unvarnished or untreated  leather so i may hav to get it treated .
It does have a smell, but with all leather products it should  fade."
"These slippers are very comfy, look so cute yet I am rating 3 starts because after 4 days they tore open on one side. I will have to sew them back on. The size is small, I usually wear size 7.5, these are 8 and are a bit small."
"I love the organization it provides for my purse, but the stitching for the pocket came undone w/in the first week."
"First of all, I LOVE Keen shoes and have many, many pairs.  Having said that, these were a bit disappointing because they fit on the large size.  I had to put insoles in them to make them fit.  Also, they are lacking in the arch support department...there virtually is none....the second reason for the insole.  They are stylish and a nice change from the lace up ones...you just need to go down a size if you don`t want to wear socks with them.  I bought a `second` pair of slip on`s from Keen  and they had the EXACT same problems so it`s not just this particular style.  I did keep them because I could solve my woe`s with green feet arch supports, but if you don`t want the added expense of having to do this, then I buy smaller or pass.  Sorry Keen."
"Wish the product came in narrow sizes.  The shoes fit as expected, for medium width."
"Wish it were a little wider made.  The support is awesome, but the shoe is just not wide enough.  Sad face."
"I purchased this wristlet for an upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  I was hoping it would be able to hold some cash/credit card, room key, and my phone.  I have a Note 4 with a pretty thin case and I have to squeeze it in.  It fits, but the zipper makes it difficult to get it in and out.  The bag would fit the things I need but nothing else.  For a girl who would need make up or other personal products, the bag my not be sufficient.  Also, the red bag is very bright red and more glossy than the picture.  I thought it would be more matte red."
Size is as expected but it is very see through. Cute dress but had to layer it
THE ZIPPER KEEPS COMING UNDONE
"definitely not the dark green which is what i wanted.
they do have a disclaimer about colors but what i received is no where near this color green.
comfortable but i have the color i received already in another top!!!"
The lace band is tight on the leg and it becomes uncomfortable after a while.
This product is very comfortable for women with large or bust but the hold is not as good as some other bras that I have purchased so I find myself readjusting throughout the day
"I liked the coat, but it is definitely a ski jacket and not good for snowboarding due to fit."
These fit our son well...the only sucky part is the zipper.  It bunches up on his chest...nice product otherwise
This fit larger than I had anticipated.  I think they are men's sizes as they are uni sex item.  I was not expecting that.
"This would have been a 5 if it is real leather. because I love the style and the size and wishing this bag would last long, which I doubt. I can already imagine now that the strap would show a wear and tear the fastest that will discourage one to use."
"This dress was really cute...however the ""full feathered"" look was a bit disappointing so I decided to go with another dress."
"meh its ok i don't wear it too often kinda wish i a got bigger size. im 5'7 and about 120lbs, usually able to wear either a small or medium depending on the brand. i got a medium to be safe, but i honestly needed a large. all and al it fits fine torso wise but the sleeves are a little tight so the back doesnt really stay on right. it was a easy fix using double sided taped but i still think it would have looked way better if i had gotten a large."
CHEAP QUALITY
"The arms of the dress fit perfect, the rest of the dress however still felt like i was swimming in it. 5'5 145 lbs"
I can't give this 5 stars because I can't wear it. I am a size 4-6 and I bought a small in this blouse expecting it to fit. It fits like a large on me. It's a lovely blouse and I would buy it again if only they had it in a size x-small. The stitching is clean and the fabric is soft and cotton.
"No more comments, too small."
"They are exactly as pictured. A nice product and hasty shipment. Just a little disappointed in size, they are very small. Smaller than a pea. Also I am a male and they are pretty girly looking."
"Good looking and looks great on.  I have a back problem & unfortunately these slippers make it worse.
If wasn't for that I would rave about them.  I call them my ""sit down & look pretty slippers"" just don't
wear them if I will be doing a lot of walking."
"I have these in pewter, size 8...very comfortable, nice, sexy...received a lot of compliments. The black is not as cute. Purchased a size 8...not true to size in this color. It was too big!"
The quality of the ties are ok. The bow tie is extremely small ... I would say for a child around 4 yrs to possibly 12 yrs old. Not suited for an adult.
too tight for my frame
"Good socks, but way overpriced.  I've had long-wearing, comfortable socks that I've bought for a lot less."
"I have been wearing the Moving Comfort Fiona bra and ventured out a little to try this one.  Does not fit the same, less coverage around the bust.  Also, it just runs smaller and the adjustable straps are narrow and stiff. I'm sticking with the Fiona."
Quality is ok some strings pulling out right off the bat. Very soft and comfortable. Runs really large should have sized down 1 or 2 sizes even.
I've worn for a day. Seem to be comfortable.  Only time will tell if they hold up to justify the price.
Was a little more risque than expected
"They are quite 'chunky' so easy to trip over and not all that cute. The width is good, though, for my wide-footed kiddo."
"The Navy Emblem was not centered in middle of shirt..  Very noticeable, but my husband liked the shirt and ok with it!!!!  Good price"
Not very comfortable but they look nice
the fabric is so thin.though i love the color.
I was first sent a blanket instead of the outfit they sent me the outfit and charged my card for a blanket. The out fit was perfect and fit like it was suppose too
"The watch certainly does not rate it's list price, but at the price I paid (90% off!) it is an inexpensive addition to the wardrobe. It looks brown on Amzaon and is grey with a brown face--but it will fit in with business wardrobe."
"Not the best material and feeling, but the price is good."
fits my children
This was my second purchase of this product. The first one was really good. The second Batch was just OK. There were a few nice stones but a lot of stones were not fully polished but dull like stone used in a drive way or garden. They did not have a polished look at all. There were a few nice quartz but the rest were dull and gray or gray blue.
"I bought the watch because I love luminox watches. I am a former G shock lover, but you cannot use G shock at night.  I love the Tritium inserts and the rugged appearance of these watches. I bought this one based of the pictures, but i just cant stand to look at it anymore.  The problem is in the green of the case.  It looks like shiny green plastic, not olive drab.  The band looks like military issue, but i cant get over the case. Too shiny and too bright green for it to look truly military.  I returned it in favor of another Luminox.

Otherwise the watch is perfect. Light and comfortable. Works perfectly all the time."
"These shoes are good for the money.. They are, however, nothing like Skechers Go Walk. They expand when you wear them. They are O.K for wearing around the house. They are not comfortable enough to go for a long walk..As one review said ""pay the money and  buy the the real thing"". Amazon has Skechers Go Walk starting at $33.00. I bought my Skechers after I received these  shoes ."
According to price.
you get what you pay for
"I never received this watch, and asked the supplier to credit my account.  I bought one of these last year, and it fell apart.  I liked it well enough to buy another one.  It is a cut watch."
"I bought this shoe about two years ago and loved it, so I was happy to see that it was still available on Amazon (but nowhere else!).  The previous version of this shoe was fabulous--cute, professional, provided support, had nice padding, and didn't shoe toe cleavage.  The current production of this shoe is much different from the previous version, and although it is the same design, the width is much narrower and the toebox is a little bit shorter.  So I was unfortunately disappointed with this particular pair."
"I suspect that these will stretch out a bit with wear, but they are a bit tight and narrow. But they are very cute and serve the purpose of every day sneakers."
"it is nice dress but I bought it for work and will not wear it to work,  just not right,  but some dressy beads or a pretty scarf and i will go dancing in it"
Cute costume.  Good thing I ordered a size up though or it wouldn't have fit.  Shipping took several weeks.  Way too long.
It's okay - plenty big !!
"This oil and emulsifier based cleanser removes all traces of makeup and does not leave skin feeling stripped.  It is an impressive makeup remover.

I have issues with the aesthetics, though.  The first time I used it, I kept wondering when it would start to foam because it felt like I was still rubbing oil and water on my skin.  I finally opened my eyes and glanced in the mirror to find it was indeed foaming.  I can't feel it changing on my face or with my fingertips.  I've used it a good two weeks now, and that hasn't changed.  I know that after I add water, it will start foaming, but I can't tell when that happens.  It is impossible to rinse off unless I use a washcloth.  I can see the makeup is gone, but water beads up on my face.  I appreciate the softness, but I really don't like leaving cleanser on my face, so I scrape it off with a wash cloth.

Yesterday, I noticed the ""Safe For"" symbol on the back of the bottle.  This symbol looks like a jar, and has a number followed by the letter ""M"".  This symbol is not on all cosmetic and personal care consumables, but I find it more and more often.  Unfortunately, according to the ""Safe For"" symbol on this bottle, the cleanser is safe to use for a mere three months after opening.  I think the average consumer will wind up wasting a lot of product.  Exceptions would be multi-user households."
I'll be honest I did not read what material the turban is made of.  I figured it would be cotton. It's not. It's some shimmer cheap fabric. It's ok for what it is. I wouldn't order another one because I'd like a better quality.
Super wide shoe. Very cute and comfortable.
Material is not good! My husband threw it after couple of wear!!
Material is good but size is much bigger. Doesnt fit my wifes wrist..too big
"Shoe was everything I was looking for. Support,great sole,and padded insole. Unfortunately it ran too wide for me and there was no way to adjust the width. Oh well."
"Cheaply made, faux leather, but for the price, ok for this summer, but sure i'll have to toss at the end of August!"
These are VERY small and thin. They're cute but would never fit my hand. I gave them away to a child.
"I like the headband, but it seems sort of short where the elastic attaches to the headband. Also where the material is gathered to stitch to the elastic part it forms big wads & feels knotty to me. For these reasons it is just ok."
"These boots are nice.  They were inexpensive so I was not expecting leather or super high quality.  They look great, but they have the worst chemical smell.  They almost smell like they have been dipped in some sort of gasoline based chemical."
"The top itself is nice. Although, it doesn't fit.  Can't wear....yet."
The fit is snug in which case I could have gone a bit larger.
The hug your head a little to tight behind the ears.
"Got this luggage for a cross country trip. First leg of the trip there was a rip on the back of the luggage very disappointing, thought it would withstand more. Overall lightweight and very spacious. Not the same material they have used in the past."
"After multiple wears, the pants are a bit too large and faded. I have the blue jeans version of these and I love those. These they are ok. Also a bit think compared to the blue jeans version. I wish I knew that they were thick since I can't really wear these in the summer."
Even a 5 size seems snug for my skinny 4 yr old boy! Pants are tugging his crotch area and divides his butt uncomfortably that he keeps pulling it down most often.
Sooooooooooo small but sooooooooooo beautiful!
"I love these, but the right boot is smaller than the left, making it difficult to put on"
"Pay attention to the sleeve size . I ended up with sleeves that were to short. Color is perfect. Not wrinkle free , ironing was a pain ."
"Very high heel and oddly built.  Really wanted to like this boot.  So I kept trying them on but honestly I could not walk across the floor.  They were an odd feeling boot.  My foot seemed to swim around, the heel is quite high. But at the same time they felt to short.  Also they hit in a strange area of my ankle.  I love Tom footwear and own several pair of flats this was my first try with a boot and heel.  I had to return the boots as I feel I would have fallen off them"
Didn't like the velour lettering.
"I've officially stop buying these shoes, though the price is right I find Chinese laundry shoes overall aren't as well constructed as other brands in the same price range"
A bit uncomfortable. I feel like I have to move like a robot and the size runs small. I DO NOT recommend wearing the underwear that go with it. It's literally just the most uncomfortable string.
"Ok, but was a little tight in breast area. Nice color."
"Pretty layering peice.
Color is pretty- style is loose-fit.
Have not washed yet, but it lookslike a shrinker. Quick hand,wash will tell. - Nice little tops"
"I liked this jacket (army green new) except it is a little brighter in person. I am 5'8 and 168 lbs... It fit perfect, i got an XL.  I ended up returning this one for the ""army green"" one because i wanted something darker.  I was excited at first but once i got the ""army green"" in the mail i was very confused.  It was the same size but about 2 inches shorter! Which makes no sense if they are the same size and it does not mention anywhere about the length difference depending on the jacket color.  So i was extremely bummed out, i really liked this darker green but it was so short! So i ended up returning that one too. now i am still in search for a bomber jacket...  :("
Cute dress.  Odd fit at top.  Returned due fit.
"Okay product and arrived quickly, needed for a mine-craft costume."
Fits a little wide in the mid section.
Has a nice soft feel.
Really a cute dress for the money but wasn't flattering on me. I returned it and got my refund the same day.
This is really pretty.. heavy and u do use bobby pins to hold it on.  wanted for my granddaug for Chrismtas but think going to hold off on it till she's older.  she is ten and not sure she could get it to stay in her hair.  needs more of a up kind of hair style..
Prefer the normal canvas to this rip stop fabric. Returned.
I really have used this product more than once and like the hold it have.  I wanted to buy a full length one too.
"They're nice, but I walked for 20 minutes and they gave me a blister on one of my heals, which made me like them a lot less...
Since they're leather I expect they will soften. Otherwise, no arch support."
They ARE super soft and cozy. But the shape looks weird on small feet.
"Cute pajamas, however a size 4 is more like a size 2."
"24 in is a great size, just what I was looking for. The color and luster look great, however, having previously owned high quality gold chains it appears the metal work is cheap. Also packaging is bare, ie few dents in the metal from the resulting shipping."
cheap too big
"fit was a little tight for my liking, other than that cant beat the price"
Would give it a five but the sleeve ends were very loose on my wrist.
"The quality of the leather is not there anymore. The pair I have from eight years ago was significantly bigger, soccer, and just overall better quality. The soul is more plastic and rubber. Very disappointed."
"I love these shoes - or at least the style. I've always had good luck with Sketchers shoes, but the heel of these was too wide and kept slipping, so I had to send them back. Very disappointing."
"Bought this to replace my old wallet.  I wanted something relatively thin but big enough to put bills in it instead of a money clip and hold cards with a windowed ID holder.  Interior canvas material was snug at first but has since loosened up so now my cards sort of float in the pockets.  I think If I turned it upside down the cards would fall out.  I don't think Id buy this wallet again but Id use it until it gets worn out or I find something better.

6-2014
The slots for the credit cards have loosened so much that the cards will fall out (and have) if the wallet is turned the wrong way even with the wallet closed.  While traveling I use Euro's and found certain foreign paper money will stick out of the wallet - its not deep enough.  The canvas parts are loose and feels like flimsy cloth now.  Threads are frayed.  But the leather portion is still holding up.  I am definitely getting something else, hopefully ALL leather construction and durable."
These rubber shoe works great for my needs. I use these to walk our dog when the grass and ground is wet. They fit as expected and are comfortable considering they are rubber. If you want a snug fit make sure to wear light weight socks. I took 2 stars off because when they came one had a white substance that looked like someone took a paint brush to a pretty large area. The other shoe was perfectly black. It took me awhile to scrub off. I did not bother returning because I will only be wearing these to walk our dog around our 40 acre property.
"The dress was nice, but it was a little too small.  Had to send it back."
I was looking for jeans that were loose in the thighs and these jeans are loose. They were also very big in the waist. I should have returned them for a smaller size. I would suggest buying one size smaller than normal. They look a little like mom jeans but they are comfy so I kept them.
"NIce, basic black shoes. Bought them for a hip hop recital for my daughter, but she hasn't used them much because of Winter. Good quality and comfortable, with cushioned insole."
"Broken after a season, I am pretty disappointed with Keen s quality"
Not sure what to do with these. Cup way bigger than normal and no support.
The size medium runs very small. Package said for a size 8-10 and it's more like a 6-7 maybe a small 8. I have a 10 year old who wears a 8-10 (very slender figure) and the dress was way to short and very tight in the arms.
"I don't normally wear necklaces, but this one is one of the cutest ever.  My daughter noticed it right away.  It's shorter than most I've worn, not quite a choker, just a little longer than that.  I call it ""delicate, with substance.""

Looks were not deceiving.  Not even two weeks after I got it, it was gone.  Sadness.  I thought I lost it in the store, but then I found the pendant on my staircase, no chain to be seen.  I later spot the chain a couple of rooms away.  It had broken, right next to the loop that the clasp grabs.  I can't use it anymore.  It's a necklace I'll truly miss.

This product was provided for review by Bamoer Jewelry."
This top wasn't for me. Disappointed that I bought the wrong size as it's much too big.  Kept it and may give it away.
comfortable for several hours but did not fair well after 9 hours at airport
"I gave this top three stars even tho' I am returning it because it really is as pretty as pictured, but...the upper arms are so small/tight I could not keep it.  I own several Lucky Brand tops and have never had any issue with the sleeves fitting before. I am between a large and a x-large and always go with a large when purchasing Lucky Brand; the rest of the blouse fits beautifully - IMO this is definitely some kind of production flaw with this particular top :(  So sad because I love it!"
"Dresses fit as expected. Sizing is consistent with what I expect from the Carter's brand.  Quality of workmanship is also good.

However, the color of the ""peach"" dress is not adequately conveyed by the photo.  It is actually a very bright fluorescent peach, practically neon.  I have pale skinned babies and this is going to look overpowering on my daughter.  Color should be fine for darker skin tones."
"These are cute for a cheap and casual flip flop, but the plastic/rubber thong in my between my toes kills. Can't wear them for more than a few minutes. I have sensitive feet though."
"Nice but to small. I'm a 38dd, I ordered a large, had to return it."
"Love these, but ripped very fast."
"I'm returning this item but overall it's okay. It runs a little small and it's basically just a stretchy, tight pull over dress. I'm 5'2, 140 lbs and the small fits but its snug. I don't know if a medium would be better or be too big. I don't find this dress appropriate for much else other than going out. Since I am looking for business professional dresses, I'm sending it back."
it was imitation it changed color
Strong leather smell:(
"These boots are adorable and very warm however, the sole is extremely thin. It almost feels like your walking barefoot! I gave them 3 stars because they are super cute and different, not the typical plain ugg looking boot that everyone has. I recommend them if you don't plan on wearing them for long periods of time and as long as you don't have back pain or need any kind of foot support. Definitely not worth paying over $30 bucks for these."
"These are nice gloves, but their color in the photos here as well as on their website is inaccurate. Chestnut is purple. No two ways about it."
more of something I'd wear over a bathing suit.
Just ran alittle small.
"Mine had what appears to be fingernail polish near the neckline.  Stain won't budge!  Otherwise, it's a cute top."
"The product was okay.  The sash/belt that was supposed to go over your shoulder is a good couple feet too short and ultimately I didn't bother using it.  Still, for the price it was a decent last minute costume."
"Its ok. I bought another one by the same company /same style, same price and the other is much better quality. not as thin and pilling"
"Not the same color grey as displayed or i assumed, mine is rather a brownish grey... but its still cool for the price....."
"Not white as shown, more cream/pink.  It came packaged nicely and it is pretty but it the pearls are NOT white as advertised."
This shoe is an odd fit to me.  There is no arch support and the fabric is odd.  I wanted to use these shoes for traveling but the fit was too odd for my feet so I returned them.  The sole didn't seem to bend.
"I bought theses awhile ago. They look nice and fit ok but man do they smell and they still smell after all this time. I rarely use them bc of how they smell, like tires."
need to order more
I suggest a half size larger
"Very narrow fit, and not very much support for a running shoe.  Very shallow heel."
"I finally use this product, at airport the front pocket ripe on side.  The second day of my trip, the backside ripped and notice is cardboard.  It states is Rfid, I don't believe it is.  Thank God I have envelope that is RFID protection of my Credit Cards.  To bad, this would had been great wallet to use for travel. It has everything I needed, but it's made very poorly.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.

The company contacted me and refund my money which was very nice of them and wanted me to retract my comments.  Thank you for my refund but I can't when I could have loss my money, credit cards or important documents.  Whoever is make your product, you need to find another company.  I change from ONE STAR to THREE, cause the refund."
"Love this for helping my posture and fixing my belly pudge, but next i need a true steel boned waist trainer because i can still move, and eat with no problem in this thing. I just wish that it was longer because I have a long torso."
"For me this type of shoe isn't for work because I need something with a strap to keep my foot in place.  Also, I wear dressy clothes for events and this shoe just isn't for that.  One more hint, they run a little big. I could have ordered a half size smaller."
Looks nice but size a little to small. Got another shoe same size and  it fit grate .
"In picture this shirt looks like is slim around waist areabut its just a big box shaped shape shirt. Fits like a mans shirt. I like my clothes to fit not toght not loose, so I just use it as a night shirt also runs a size large."
I love these however they broke already :(
"I tried on a pair of these jeans at a local store (Kohl's), and this size fit. I ordered it online, and it was too small. I guess they sell slightly different types of the same brand?? Sent them back."
I liked the color but not the way it looked on me.  No problem though.  I gave it to a friend and liked it just fine.
"IMPLIED IT WAS REAL AMBER AND SILVER, NOT. OVER PRICED CONSIDERING IT'S FAKE. IT'S STILL PRETTY SO I'LL KEEP IT BUT FELT THE DESCRIPTION WAS DECEITFUL."
Way too big of a stone! Not realistic at all!
"This shoe just wasn't what I expected, it looked more like a bedroom slipper than a shoe I would wear with a dress or skirt."
First time around the inner sole was missing but new pair is ok.
"These shoes look very nice and look expensive, however they seem to run short and alittle snug in the toes area."
My first pair of Saucony. I use them for walking. Not much cushion. Prefer ASIC Gels.
"I like the diaper, however I don't think the weight description is accurate. My son is just under 20 lbs so I ordered the 6-12 month size (per the fitting guide), and it was way too small in the thighs."
Hard to see the dials
"Love design but sizing was less than accurate. As a male nurse with little options for scrub wear that is not monochromatic and simply bland, this was purchased for wear as a scrub top that would provide mild visual stimulation for the patients. Looks good but tight across the chest. Hope it doesn't shrink in the wash."
"More like slippers than shoes.. Not enough support for me, was looking for more of a clog
type shoe."
"My son stated it ran too big, when the product reviews stated it ran small so I ordered larges."
This shoe has very high mid soles and low heal cup. If you walk heal striking first they are very painful after a few hours of walking. I would guess these shoes are designed as a trail running shoe not hiking shoe.
Bought the largest and I'm a medium size and this seems more like an XS
"It cuts slightly into the top of my right foot.  Hopefully, this will change with more wear."
"Large and shapeless, but can be fixed, once I have some time"
Good idea but a little tight around the legs.
"like like the look of the shoe but, its too stiff. i put them on and took them right off. when i'm in the right mood to break them in, i'll let you know my final assessment on these. when it comes to gym shoes, i like a broken in already effect."
"I have another pair of these that I bought at a shoe store, so I already knew I needed to size up a half size. These still dig into my heels some."
"I didn't like this dress but gave it 3 stars because there are a lot of nice things about it. The material was nice, well constructed. Pockets were nice and laid flat.  I'm 5'7"", 130 lbs and ordered the S which fit like a sack around the middle. I don't think an extra small would work because the small did fit around the shoulders, it was just really baggy around the middle. I don't want a summer dress to hug my figure, but it would be nice if it followed the lines of my figure and this dress didn't. I'm returning it."
the fit was odd and they just weren't comfortable for me.  That's not to say they wouldn't be perfect for someone else.  They get 3 stars because the return was super easy.
These socks are comfortable but not as low cut/no show as I anticipated. They are visible when worn with cross-training shows.
"Very nicely constructed, but, a bit tight for a 12 yr old..."
"Nice quality of socks, I liked the colors"
"I ordered this in white, thinking it would pull together a few outfits...but when I put it on, it looked like a white lab coat.  I think this would be nice in any other color, but I wouldn't recommend the white.  Also, the fabric is more of a jersey than a sweater material, which is fine, and it is actually a decent weight.  I'll probably exchange this for another color."
Really cute runs right I usually buy small so got a medium and it was tight
"Decent slippers , fit as you'd expect for the small, med., large type deal to I run a size 10 and they are roomy in the medium size, warm but they do feel like the padding under the heel will collapse down fairly fast ."
it fits as expected but the design is not that great.
It was kind of big.  It was suppose to have adjustable straps. It didn't.  That may have helped it to fit better.
Good shirt. Not especially soft fabric. Good for the price.
"The dress is well made, fabric is a bit cheap feeling, the cut is cute and it is an actual full circle skirt.
The really big bummer is the really small size. I am a US size 12, 5'3'' 36 G I ordered the XXL and I knew this dress would require some work on my part. However the dress is shorter than anticipated. It hits me above the knee and the torso is short (and I have a pretty short torso)
If you are a US size 12 or a UK 14, this might not work for you."
"Smaller than expected, even though ordered larger. One sleeve was torn and I will need to repair. Fabric and fasteners appear tp be good quality. Laces not as good."
"Good designed product, not made with the best matterials."
"I'm 5 months pregnant. 5'9"" 170lbs and found the large to be too small. I do think when I'm back to 150lbs I will find these to be comfortable, but for now the large was too tight."
"My 6 year old daughter received these as a Christmas gift after begging for Toe Socks like her older sister.  However, the socks seem to be too big for her and she gets so frustrated trying to get them on...Needless to say, she hasn't worn them once :("
"The inside feels rough to the skin and unpleasant unless you got elephant skin.  It comes a size larger than expected.  I usually wear medium and usually it's tight.  But the small size for this is still a little big for me.  Very Rugged though.

I'm a prime member and it was delivered USPS.  The mail man didn't even try to deliver it and I had to go post office and deal with rude postal clerks on top."
"The quality and colors chosen are impeccable to thy own taste, however the length is something to be desired, it should be at least six inches longer.  Out of a possible 10, I give it a 5."
"they do run small--not to the point of discomfort but they are snug--

my problem is they DO squeak. Right out of the box as I walked they squeaked. :( :( :( I was wondering what other reviewers meant when they said that--sadly now I know. Probably sending them back--sadly as they are gorgeous!"
Wear out quickly.
"Definitely keeps me warm and the fit is as expected, BUT, the one thing that really bothers me is this - when I have it on, it's one of those shirts that feels like you have it on backwards.  I'm constantly tugging at it to stretch it forward so it feels like it's on the right way.  I'm afraid for that reason I might not wear it as much as I'd like."
"Nice but not extra long. I wear 36"" inseams and am thin to average. These were nice quality but were too tight in the thighs and definitely not long enough."
It will keep me dry while enabling me to keep my hands free
This shirt fits weird. It''s tight all over except for around the neck. It'a so loose around my neck that my bra strap show. Maybe I can wear it around the house...
"not bad, already breaking thought.."
"This did not say on Amazon that it was a men's shoe stretcher. I can barely get it into my size 7 women's shoes, but I persevered on a pair of patent leather pumps and it did work so I will keep it."
"Beautiful watch. No one believes it was under $25. Interior fogged on a humid day, It didn't keep correct time, and crown popped off.  However, the company has offered a free replacement to re-review, so I have added two stars for good customer service.  If the poor watch I received and reviewed was just  a fluke, this watch would deserve 5 stars."
not exactly the most comfortable shoes. The top is also extremely wide
"RUNS VERY SMALL, AND THE MATERIAL IS VERY STIFF, EVEN AFTER WASHING IT.  IF I HAD TIME TO RETURN IT I WOULD, BUT IT WAS FOR A PARTY."
"PROS
-cute print
-functional enough
-affordable

CONS
-You must back your bag strategically or it will topple over (not stand on it's own)
-Probably not the most durable if you travel regularly, but for occasional weekend trips and such--good enough"
"It's ok, but it's not very long. Last hole and it's still tight. The band is made well but it's not long"
"Good/cute watch to wear for a child learning to tell time.  The adjuster (silver button) was scratching my kids wrist, so stopped wearing it."
"The biggest problem is that they are hot! There are no air vents and the fake leather they are made of does not breathe at all.
Other reviewers had written about these sneakers running small and they are. But,I think size is fit as expected."
Great shoe. A little larger then we expected but almost fits with socks. They seem wider then I thought. I would buy again except that on a toddler the front scuffs pretty easily...maybe in a darker color they wouldn't but white shoes it well.
Dress is a little longer than I expected. Since the picture of the front doesn't give any indication of the back I was drips ord by the straight across cut as opposed to a more scooped of v shaped back.
"It's okay.  I started to send it back, but I thought I can live with it."
"Beautiful tie, but realize it is an ADULT length tie, not a kids' length."
It's ok. You get what you pay for.
"I'm wearing the same pants in a 38/30 size and they are a little loose, so I ordered a pair 36/29 but they are at least 4 inches smaller.  I love the ones that fit though."
"My feet are medium wide and these were slightly too narrow. You have to adjust the strap pretty tight to keep your feet from sliding forward, but the straps do stay put. Might be fine for medium feet that need arch support."
to small. i gave it to my wife and she likes it
The size ran very small
"this was priced too high for what you get.  fabric too thin / flimsy to depict a true leisure suit.. was expecting thicker ""polyester look"" but this was thin fabric, cheap looking ...extremely wrinkled !! couldn't get wrinkles out.  VERY LARGE and roomy ... all in all, still funny and make a good show at the disco party """
"gorgeous dress, but you might want to buy a slip to go with it - it's very see-through."
"These were nice, but after wearing and washing a couple of times they stretched out terribly. They use to fit as expected. Now they buldge between snaps and the neck is very stretched. Won't let her sleep in these anymore."
"Very nice durable jacket, but completely off on the sizing. Ordered Men's Small, and size was almost as big as a Men's Large. Difficult to determine what size to order. Best estimate is a size Small is really an Medium/Large size, and that is giving room for a heavy shirt underneath."
"If you have fat toes, these will not fit. My daughter was unable to wear these, but I can. They feel as if they could easily break in half when you stretch them out to fit your toe.  They're very thin. We were disappointed that my daughter wasn't able to wear them. But they do fill their purpose and are comfortable. Just beware if you have fat little piggies."
"Last time I bought Aerosoles they were tight so this time I ordered a size up and they were too large.
Plus the sound of the heal on hardwood floors or tile was extremely loud. Not at all like my last pair with rubber soles. It's the heal not the toe thats loud."
This is a nice boot but definitively need zippers. They are hard to wear and remove. Nice material and design but not practical
Both Hoodies were same style and fit almost the same way to small around neck and chest areas.
"I was impressed that it was a much nicer fabric than is represented in the photo and on the packaging. However the collar was pretty much unfinished. Just floppy and not cut well. The photo shows a sturdy collar that stands up. Fortunately I can sew, so I fixed it."
"Fit comfortably and seem sturdy, but the opening is too wide.  I often like to wear jeans out over boot tops but these are just to wide and catch the pants.  I ended up giving them to charity."
"Pretty shirt, good price and good service.  However, the length was not stated in the description and it is a bit too short for a comfortable ""over-pants"" shirt."
Smaller than I expected - think I'll give it to my granddaughter.  It's nice - just not the size I wanted.
"I thought this would be more of a light shirt, but it is a sweater! I was surprised and I like it! It looks great on too!"
It fits very tight. I doubt I will wear it except on only coldest of days.
I have given three out as presents so far & ALL will need taking in a bit
Felt stiff and looked a bit clownish.  They went back.
Very nice jeans. I don't feel they are woke work the asking price. They stretch all over about like women's leggings. They are very soft though. My husband wears a 35 generally and these are a tad too big I think mainly caused they are so stretchy. They do seem like they are well made though. I just don't think I would price them quite so high.
"Item had a slight smell, and it fit OK."
"Great styling.  It could have been exactly what I have been searching for for months.  I wear a 36DD in regular bras and fit perfectly in a 38DD in this one.  This is a bearcat to get into.  If you can put your bra on from the front and reach your arms around to fasten it, then you will be okay with this one.  I have great flexibility in my shoulders, elbows and wrists and COULD NOT get this one fastened."
"I've previously bought the shoe labeled as womens, but same size. These feel a bit large"
"These are flip-flops minus the strap if you order a size 2, which I did for my son & I wanted them to have a strap for a secure fit...at least he like them & I can make a strap"
"Fits a little big and not a lot of shape. Could be softer material / better  fabric but it's  pretty warm. The pockets are at a weird position, they aren't in the front like you'd think. When I button it they are on my hips."
Purchased for my boyfriend and he's a standard 32/30 but these ran pretty large. He seemed to be swimming in them all around. It states it's a modern fit but expect them to run loose.
"Super cute shoe, but sadly I had to send them back.  Too narrow for my feet and I don't have wide feet!"
"I am 5'11"" 170 lbs and wear a 34 jeans. I ordered the 38 tall and it is too small. The pant legs are almost too long but the torso is too small. When I sit it squeezes my stomach and if I raise my arms over my head the crotch area comes up and is very uncomfortable. So anyone ordering I suggest you go a lot larger than you would think. Especially if you plan to wear any cloths under it. Build seems to be good though if you can get one to fit. Seems warm. I was hot while trying to get out of it lol"
a little large where sleeves connect to bodice of dress
The shirt is a little tighter than expected. It's also fuschia and not red at all. Overall I like it but I just wish it was actually the color pictured.
Decent top. Long and smooth material. More of a t-shirt than an actual top. Good for casual wear.
i ordered 2 pair of these shorts 1 red 1 blue i ordered both in 4x so they would be a little baggy the red ones are fine the blue ones must be labeled wrong because they are at least a 5x if not 6x  too bad i waited a while before wearing the blue now its to late to return but all in all they are nice comfortable shorts
"They're hiphuggers. If on the other hand, you have a 6 pack worth sporting and no love handles, by all means get these pants and show off without spending big money on Lulumon.

If your bodyfat is in the general area of 25%, I'd say get them and wear a longish shirt and wait until you can workout in public with a bra that matches the pants and no longish shirt.

A bit tight just below the knees, but that's ok you wouldn't want them to sag."
"I really like these shorts. Very comfortable and the waist fits great. I'm 5'10"" 160 lbs. The color is also great and it's a very light pair of shorts. My issue is that they are too long for me and extend too far past the knees. To me, it feels a bit awkward like that. I do recommend for the price."
I returned these. The foot area fit well and was comfortable but when walking my heel would lift out.
"Sadly it did not fit. Very well made, lined and great fabric, but it would not close over my bust."
This dress is beautiful but fits quite small and gets even smaller at the bottom. I couldn't even walk in it.
"I have another Anni Coco dress that's just great, but this one feels very cheap/mediocre in the materials. It arrived ridiculously wrinkled compared to other dress purchases, so you'd probably need to spend about as much as the dress cost in the first place to have someone who knows what they're doing de-scrunch it.

The material is also very yellow for a white, and is quite transparent."
"This crossbody purse is gorgeous in the details but the green part is flaking after only a very short time.  I had full intention of taking this for our vacations because it's light, beautiful and just the right size.  The strap is perfect for whatever length I want to use it - over the shoulder or crossbody.  But because the green is flaking off, I don't want to take it.  I even went through the process of using the Anusckha spray preservative before I used this handbag for the first time.  It didn't do any good since it started flaking within a few uses.  I have owned several Anuschka handbags and wallets in the years past and all of them are still beautiful.  This one is a disappointment although the wolf design is beautiful."
"I like the cut and color, but the fabric isn't great and seems like it will fall apart quickly."
"So, I love it ...but...it started pulling apart after wearing it for 30 mins. Seriously super cute, I love the style, but it's pretty cheap if it falls apart instantly...which is so SAD. If the stockings themselves were made out of a slightly thicker material it would be AMAZING."
they should have more available sizes this size a little too large only one size was available even though my chest is 48 inches the size is 48 to 52 inches
"I have very wide feet, and got the 12 by 6E size... unfortunately, they are just a bit too snug, there's no 12.5 size, so I'm bag to the 13 by 6E even though that size is too long.  To be honest at the size 12-6E they really feel like a 4E, just not as roomy as they should be.  Also, I still like the prior model more (MW811) than the current 812, the stitching and fit are a bit different, and the travel while you walk is more relaxed in the new model (I think they changed the rollbar material).

All that said, it's a nice shoe and one of the few manufacturers that actually make sizes for big/wide feet, with decent support.

The support is actually way better than most offer, which is greatly appreciated."
"These looked to be fairly good quality.  However, the way in which they are constructed makes them tight around the ankle.  We tried to cut the elastic, but this didn't help, either.  Good gripping soles.  Bought these for an elderly lady who has poor circulation.  They didn't work for her."
"It is a thin material.  Where it was cut is uneven.  But the length is perfect.  I would return it, but it is an ok basic."
"Good swimsuit for the price. I'm 5'7 230 lbs (pear-shaped) 38DD and I purchased the 4XL. The top is a little big, but the bottom is perfect."
"However, the quality of the necklace look cheap.  THe rose gold is too ""rose gold"".  It gives it a cheap appearance."
Bought for my grandchildren for summer fun.  Too bad half of them don't work.
"Looks nice, but kind of hard to read the time.  Plastic is soft so it wears comfortably."
Love the construction. Fits a little small.
Nice but cheap looking from the back.
It's a shirt alright.
Runs VERY small. I bought a medium and I usually purchase a small in other brands of hoodies and they are perfect. This medium looks and fits like an extra small.
so large
"Good watch for the price, nothing more."
"Overall, this is better than a fleece sweatshirt.  It fits well in the shoulders, but it tapers down to become somewhat restricting and becomes very long (below my hips).  If they could eliminate the taper and reduce the length, then it would be 5 stars."
Shrunk after one single wash
Medium looked more Small but decid
NICE SHIRT FITS AS EXPECTED ONLY THING IS THIS SHIRT IS VERY VERY LONG!!!! LIKE DOWN TO THE KNEES LONG. MUST TUCK IN
I ordered up a size and still too small. My feet are right over the heel.
"I may not be accurately reflect the price into consideration for my evaluation.

First, the service was very good, and the seller answered all my questions promptly.  Thus, I have no complains there.  Second, the delivery was fast and no issue there either.  And third, I received what I ordered.

The issue I have is the quality of the stones.  I own 1 carat ring & necklace (H, VS1).  I need a matching earrings, and I heard earrings do not have to be high quality as they are not looked at up close.  Thus, I went for these set.  What I did not realize was that I1 diamond does not reflect lights very well due to impurities in them.  Although one cannot see too well if the diamonds have impurities in them or not unless up close, but I can tell right away if I see them under sunlight.  Even when I clean them thoroughly, they look rather dull.  They do not sparkle as my ring or necklace.  As I bought 1 1/2 carat, they are noticeable.

I am not saying it is bad for the price.  I saw 1 carat earrings (I, VS2) about the same price as 1 1/2 (H, I1).  If I started over, I would go for a smaller ones with higher quality as jewelries need to sparkle with lights.  But it is just my preference.  Some might prefer bigger stones.

Basically, I am saying I got what I paid for.

Lastly, I would have gone with yellow-gold rather than white-gold.  I1 diamond in white-gold look just like sterling silver imitation."
"This is a pretty flimsy little hat. It's okay for throwing in the pack for an extra while out hiking in case you need one. It has the old school plastic snap back, which I used to like. This one is kinda small - best for smaller heads or kids, maybe. The ""mesh"" area of it is not very well made but is breathable. If you want a hat to wear regularly, this is not the one - there are a great many hats that are of better quality that are right around the same listed price. Not a bad color - wish the hat was better. This product was purchased at a discount for the purpose of evaluating it and providing a public review - hope it helps."
its not bad just good stuff for gifts. i prefer the real ones tho...
Color wasn't was I was expecting but I still like them.
The shoes are very cheaply made. They're not going to last long. They're not very comfortable and extremely flimsy.
Not a bad top. It has an almost papery feel but I think that's because it's inexpensive. For the price it does the trick.
"I have had this product for a while now and can see a difference. However, it takes a while before you see a difference. I wore this for a couple hours a day. It hurt to wear at night while I was sleeping. Wearing it over your t-shirt works much better that directly on your body. Works well but don't expect immediate results!"
"I expected a ""tall tee"" to be, well.....tall. It's fits alright but doesn't really have the length I was expecting. Decent construction so I'll still wear it, but for tall tees I'd look elsewhere."
"Ok so far. Not sure what they mean by DuraShock, I don't feel any shock absorption."
works fine good price and look good
"I define a wind breaker as a light outer jacket that stops the wind and maybe some light rain from getting through. It seems like most stores do the same. This, however, is not that; it's a heavy, completely non-breathable polyester shell. It's got mesh on the inside, though I don't know why, because there's nowhere to wick sweat too, it just saturates. For cold-weather activities, where you will be wearing several layers, I imagine this would be a very good outer layer, most certainly keeping out all but the most stubborn rainstorms and raging winds. But I needed a windbreaker for warm-weather activities in case of a sudden squall or the wind picked up (l hike in the mountains) and this was suffocating and, after a few minutes, soaking wet with my sweat on the inside. It's not a bad jacket, but it should be listed as a shell, not a windbreaker. I did not actually try the hood, but it folds up into the collar, which is a little big and bulky; again, I wouldn't care if I was wearing layers and, say, a turtle-neck, but without that, the collar kind of irritated my neck."
"Ordered these after the size 9 new balance boot didn't work out.  Had same problem with toe box being uncomfortable,  so returned them.  Although this boot comes in 9.5, I do Not  like style as well as I liked the New Balance WO790.  I ordered  9.5 in a different color in the new balance.  Have not received them yet"
"You must have short torso to wear this swimsuit.  I'm not a tall girl (5' 1"", 130 lbs.) I think I have an average torso--I have never had problems with stuff not fitting my torso. When I tried this swimsuit on, the top did not cover my chest and I had ordered a large. Very quick shipping though.  Seemed like good quality too."
"I love these shoes, they look great but they just fall off my feet when I walk.  They are not too big, my toes are to the end. It is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.  There is little structure to them since they are made of fabric so maybe that is the problem."
"My husband rated these 9/10 for comfort. But they just look a little like old man shoes. I couldn't fully explain why, just something about them. Then I noticed on the box that Dunham is owned by New Balance. I didn't think it was worth $150 so we returned them."
Didn't fit right and zipper not well made.
"I read the reviews and thought these boots ran small but they don't. I'm a size 10 and got a size 10.5. Therefore they're big on me and don't like it. Also, the calf IS snug. (I don't zip it all the way)"
comfortable.....but has different texture of feeling to material
It looks okay but the fit is not so comfy. Its quite big. It's just a simple everyday wear slippers not for special occasions. Thanks!
"I'm satisfied with my purchase
It's not that great of a wig
But IT served my purpose."
This was ordered for a petite 70 year old. I got the medium thinking it would fit loose and be comfortable. It is actually more like a small. The color is true to the picture and I think she will still be able to wear it but not sure after she washes it.
Very flimsy bags...Could have been a better quality..
"I bought these for my son who wears a size small, 29 waist. according to the size chart on website small was for waist 28-30. well when the package arrived right on the back of the package says small 30-32. Really, I take them out and sure enough they are too large for my son, at least they fit my husband so he took them. I will not be buying fruit of the loom on amazon anymore."
Nice but way  too long and graphics wore off within 2 months.
Not for little girls as I intended they are much too large but very pretty
"The concept is wonderful since the clear gel pads create a rash or worse without the cloth envelopes.  However, I find them far too bulky when worn together, even under a sports tee shirt.  I do wear just the cloth envelope and it does the job I need by spreading the pressure across a larger area."
"The style of these glasses cannot be beat in my opinion. They look awesome. There are 2 negatives that cannot be overlooked though: 1) is the price. Price is not necessarily a disqualifier for me until you get to 2) the lenses are soft and very easily damaged. I'm not hard on sunglasses but these things are thoroughly unforgiving.

Paying top dollar for a stylish but fairly fragile pair of shades is throwing away your money. I tried a pair of peppers which are not nearly as stylish but far more durable for 20% of the cost."
"The shoe was a little narrow. Kind of pinchy. Not what I expected from a regular width shoe. Usually love this brand and own several pair in leather. Love the color, will re-home them to a friend."
"From a name brand I kind of expected more of this product. The crotch region is still way too tight and doesn't really stretch. I don't like the fact that the zippers come apart at the front (I own another cheaper brand pants and they unzip in the back so you can make ""knee vents"" instead of taking the bottom portion off if you get hot) because if you fall, you're scraping up your knees. The fabric's held up but I'll wear my REI Venturis over these any day (it sits in the corner of my hiking gear box pretty much now)"
Sandal was not attractive on my foot. Didn't suit my style
"There no room for the nose so it fits pretty akwardly. Its decent, gets the point across. Only problem i had was there being no room for the nose"
"the shirt is comfy and soft, but it hugs just under your stomach and makes you look pregnant if you have a tummy at all. I wear a large usually and got an XL so it would be looser fitting, but it stills huge my stomach even with shapewear underneath."
Feet are really snug inside with normal socks. Maybe my feet are wider than normal feet??? (shrug)
"I am giving these a 3 star because they are nice looking but, the fit was not right for me.  I had to send them back as the top of the shoe was pressing down on my foot.  I believe this particular pair was defective so returned them."
"This t shirt is advertised as  being 100% cotton, that's the reason I ordered it. But its 60% cotton and 40% poly. I think that they should correct this."
Cute skirt but crazy crazy long.  Had to roll up 4 times so it looks dumb.  Returning for a smaller size.
Good detail. Slight chemical smell that dissipated upon airing out.
How does it fit? It doesn't! Very small. I must admit I was excited when I saw it in the package. It's really beautiful. Looked like I wanted to. Then I tried it on. Much to my disappointment it would not meet in the middle. Like a out 8 inches from meeting. You CANNOT trust the size guide. I have decided I can no longer order anything made in China. It won't fit. Sorry Amazon!
"The charm is quite lovely however the chain is extremely delicate.  When it arrived the change had come out of the pocket in the back of the holder and became tangled to the point I had to take it to a jeweler to get it untangled.  It was a gift, so thankfully it arrived a day or so earlier than planned as I was down to the wire.  If the chain were just a little more sturdy, this would be 5 stars."
"I have three other models of Asics shoes (all size 10), and they fit me perfectly and have better than average arch support.  I ordered these online, thinking that they would be similar to the others.  They are labeled size 10, but I think they are actually a size 9 or 9.5.  They are just too tight.  Also, there is very little arch support.  I need good arch support, and bought these other models of Asics because of that.  These have to be sent back... sorry I can't recommend them, but I *do* recommend the other Asics models I have (Kahana, TR-150, Kanbarra).  I think the TR-150s have the best arch support of my 3."
I loved the fact that there were so many colors and I loved the bows..  But they made really big indents on my baby girls head.  We decided not to use them after the few times it caused the indents.
material was nice but the sweater was too big - even for the oversized look. I'm 5'1 and 100 lbs
A bit tight but I'm hoping the leather will stretch a bit.  Great show otherwise.
"I have other Ahnu shoes in 11.5M, and they fit perfectly.  Though I had read some reviews that found the Jack II ran a bit large, I had thought that perhaps all Ahnu shoes fit those buyers on the large side.  However, these are a bit loose on my feet, with just a bit more play at the heel than I prefer.

Two odd things: they are still fairly comfortable; and, even though a bit large once on, they are a bit tight to actually put on, due to the way the tongue catches on my foot.

They do fit closer to size than do my similar Clark's, which feel about a half size too big."
I think you should only buy it if you need wheels. Apart from that I don't find any reason to buy this. This backpack is double as heavy as normal backpack. The space inside this bag is quite ordinary for its size. I wouldn't recommend this unless you absolutely need wheels in backpack.
"I had previously purchased Merrell Men's Mojave Waterproof Hiking Shoe and like them very much.

On the plus side the Merrell All Out Blaze hiking shoes from appearances seem to be well made. Unfortunately, the toe box is too narrow and the heel cup seem large and also there isn't an insole. So much for arch support.

I have not worn these shoes 'outside' yet, but the Blaze seems to be the ""poor cousin"" of the Merrell shoe family."
"Looks cute, but honestly didn't love it. I think I would have liked it better without the lace, as the top is flattering. The lace doesn't really separate in the midline unless you are wider (and definitely wider than the model) and it looks like a cover-up with the slit straight up the middle to your crotch, which is not a flattering look on most people (see attached pic as proof). It's definitely a PUSH-UP top, so if you don't need the push-up, beware. If you have next to nothing, this will flatter you well. It also fits well and won't fall off if you were to jump into a pool or something. I'm too pale to pull it off, and just look washed up and it didn't lay right on me.  Not worth returning, but wouldn't have bought it in a store if I had tried it on. I wore it half a day on vacation and then haven't worn it since.

UPDATE: Seller contacted me and offered 1/2 refund if I removed my review. I don't consider this an inappropriate or poor review, so I'm not. I simply told the truth based on how it fit me--which may not be how it fits others. I like to read other people's reviews and helps me make an informed decision, which could still be to buy the suit--it just depends on how you are shaped and what you are looking for"
"The previous reviewers said to order a half-size smaller.  I should have listened, because that is exactly how much they were too big.  I'm hoping that eventually cinching them up with the laces may help, but so far they're sliding off the back of my feet.  Otherwise very comfy and warm, without being too hot."
"This blouse fits a little big, but the material is very comfortable. I am 5'ft, but am a 34 D in the chest. I got a large. Length wise its perfect, around the breast it fits well, but rather large in the shoulders."
"This dress is okay but the material is very cheap. I was looking for something more richer looking.
I did keep it though. I will dress it up with some accessories."
They are comfy shoes
"As soon as I put them on and attempted to button them, one of the buttons broke off. Yes, they are my size and they do fit but the buttons are not secured properly.
Other than that, they're great. The fit is awesome and I would definitely purchase more colors.
I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review"
"the picture makes it look a little more pastel than what i got, the color just looks ugly in real life in my opinion. doesn't look great on me either, but for the price you get what you pay for. it doesnt feel bad or look like really poor quality, it's just not for me."
Nice soft material. New. But the The neck was not cut properly cut So I have to take that to a dressmaker make a smooth neck cut.. This is more suited as a blouse For anyone over 5 feet 5 inches or has long legs
"These are super cute and comfy, until you've had them on a while while breaking them in...they seem pretty narrow up in the front at the toes, which is causing my little toes on both feet, to be super red and raw/sore when I take them off. I'm hoping the breaking-in process will help & that they will stretch out. I didn't need a bigger size in order to correct that problem, b/c I am doing good to keep them in place without my heel coming up out of them as I walk. I can tell if I had ordered even a half size bigger, my heel would be coming out of them on each step."
It is small and cute. The chain is horrible.
useful but it will not last long to be passsed to another child or somebody else. fits well baby hands snugly;-)
"The pendant itself is very cute, but the chains on both of them broke within the first hour of being worn."
Very cute and soft but size seems much to big for for the 0 to 3 month old baby
Cute but small. I returned item
These are short for the size
"This skirt is made from a very nice quality knit fabric.  My biggest concern was that the exterior seams of the skirt are not attractive...I don't understand why they have stitching on the outside, it kind of makes the skirt only functional as a casual skirt and not as a dress skirt as well.  I usually wear a women's xl, but the large fits perfectly."
"Very comfy, but fit too small compared to ALL of my sons other shoes. I would've returned them if he hadnt already taken the tags off and worn them. Disappointed. :-("
"This shoe is fine if someone has mildly wide feet. My dad has a medical condition that has his toes, feet and ankles super swollen. His foot could not fit into this shoe. As well, the comfy insoles decreased the amount of space for the foot. Otherwise seemed like a decent shoe and would have kept if it had fit comfortably."
"These were indeed beautiful and luxurious feeling but the heel is so narrow they are near impossible to get on my foot!  Once I finally forced my foot into them, the adidas footbed is great but the boots are really short and quite tight inside.
Considered ordering a full size lager, but the shipping back and forth and the probability that they would still not have room for real socks made be return for refund."
"The quality is fair, but the fit is way too large. Larger than any other Steve Madden shoe I've owned.

Comes with extra laces which is nice, I'm going to try a half size down. However, the half size is a difference of 30 bucks and change!"
"The shoes are nice, but the heel is too high.  I don't recommend walking outside."
"Beautiful design, somewhat flimsy material. Not for hard wear."
"I have been buying Saucony shoes for my boys for years. I love them, and they love them. I usually get a different style but decided to try this since my son is getting older. It runs really big, and the quality just isn't there."
"I was not pleased with the way the cups fit. It lacked good support without the straps. I have the longline strapless bra as well,your better off with that. I think it will work ok with some of my strapless items though."
"I ordered two pairs, medium and large. In each pair the gloves were not the same (same size label but not in reality). One large glove had fingers shorter than the medium. One gloves seam was already coming apart. And another had a small beige stain on a finger.  They are cheap gloves, not good for repeated use. But they work for costumes."
I love these for work.  Just wish they were stouter.  They only last me a few months.  Fred Meyer carries them also
The sweater is nice but it is a little bit to tight.
"Love the style and look of these shoes. I ordered the correct size, and when I put them on they fit perfect, but when I walk in them my foot slides around making them feel too big. I think it's because the insole is a slippery soft material. Otherwise, I really like them. Just wish they fit better."
"Item is a good size, is a statement piece and not to heavy to wear. I have purchase nicer pieces for around the same price."
very simple and handles malfunctioning
"I received the bag in black today and was disappointed. It is smaller than what I expected, the width of the bottom is only 3"" which is narrow for my need and the overall size is too small. Leather is a bit dull.  It is well-made though. I have owned Frye Jenna Disc Tumbled leather bag and Skull Stud Leather Bag, they both are brown and stunning in every ways.  Perhaps, brown leather would bring the beauty out of it.  With this price range and when it does not make me WOW, it will be returned."
"Loved it at first but after a few wearings it started to bunch up a little in the waist area, which made it begin to pinch and hurt. I have had it for several months now, and only wear it occasionally."
It was okay for the price I paid. I am a bodybuilder in the RN Program so soon as I flex most scrubs get destroyedthis uniform from this vendor was no exception!
"These shorts were a gift for my son. The label & description suggested that these were stretch. They had no latex or any stretch material. They were cotton,  cut on the bias. My son said they looked weird & my daughter in law said that looked weird. They were returned to Amazon."
Thinner material but comfy.
This really gaped open and just didn't work for me.  Return was hassle free.
These are nowhere near as cozy as the more expensive Merrells but they were ok. Lining is thin. Wore them for a season and then went back to the nicer Merrells.
"These sandals didn't fit small on my feet: in fact, my normal size 7.5 was too large!
I have somewhat narrow/skinny feet and although, they fit fairly well lengthwise, but still a little bit long, the straps and ankle portion were too loose to provide any stability.
The soles are hard, but moderately shaped to conform to the foot.
I probably would have loved these if they would have fit. !/2 size smaller would probably be too short."
Could be bigger for comfort
I wear a size 7-3/8 hat.
The purse is a bit narrow inside. Hard to open it as wide as I'd like. The color in the photo is true to what is received. It does stay in great shape.
This dress has a lining that feels like fleece. It would make it very hot to wear in the spring or summer.
Was a tad to small. Always order one size up then what the chart says. Can't get it ripped on my own.
was supose to be assorted colors and when opened it was all the same color!
tell myself...go to a brick and mortar and try them on!!!!!
"I ordered these for my husband, they were too narrow. Sizing for these shoes are weird. Be prepared that if you order these they will either be to big or to small."
"Nice heavey weight material. However, the shirt was a lot longer than expected and not quit  big enough around the middle. I ordered a 4XLT which usually fits great. I have to have a tall to keep from showing my gut. I think I will return this and try a 5XL."
Cups were on the smaller size. I wear a 32DD or 32DDD depending on brand. This bra I ordered a 32DD and the cups were much too small.
"These run small. I always wear a size 7, but size 7 doesn't fit. I need to return them."
"Usually wear 8.5 or 9, but ordered a 10 just in case and its good I did. VERY narrow. Soft inside though and a bit taller than I thought they would be. Will post more after I wear them for a day or two."
"It looks very nice, love the color.  However, this RFID blocking wallet is for Android phones only.  I have an iPhone 6+ and it does not seem to be compatible.  My husband is using the wallet and loves it even though it doesn't seem to work with the iPhone."
"The hat is a lot smaller than I imagined. It's not as stretchy & doesn't cover my entire head which is the reason I bought it. So I'm disappointed but instead of returning it, I'm going to give the set to someone as a gift. Aside from the hat size, the quality of the material & everything else is great!! :)"
"NICE SHOE HOWEVER THE DOWN FALL IS THE SIZE....I BOUGHT TWO PAIRS OF THESE SHOES IN THE 9-10 \\\\ ONE PAIR FIT THE OTHER PAIR IS SO BIG IT FITS LIKE A SIZE 11
1\2.....GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER....I ORDER THE THE SIZE 7\8 ITS TO SMALL SENDING IT BACK"
The bra fit all right. There just wasn't quite enough support for me.  I will not be ordering another one.
It appears Hanes has opted for more profit via less material. Laying a new shirt on top of old it was evident less material. So the large I had previously ordered now requires an XL. Plus I found considerable shrinkage after first washing. That could be contributed to a different material as not all their colors are of the same. Hanes needs to be more descriptive in details.
"These are so tight, they smash all your padding around and make your butt look flatter than it really is. And there's a hem-like seam on the bottom which can show through workout pants."
these look like the picture. Color and all but they are at least a 1/2 size too big. I do like them enough to exchange them for a smaller size.
"The quality of these flip flops is slightly disappointing for the price, but it can be tricky buying based on photos. Be aware, however, that the sizing chart is misleading. The recommended number size=inches measurement to replace the two year-old size 9 Rafters I'd been wearing is size 12. But when the Reefs arrived they measured nearly an inch longer than the size 12 length indicated in the sizing chart, so be aware.  They look a little like individual boogie boards for my feet, but since they're just for wearing around the house, exchanging them for a smaller pair isn't worth the hassle.  I actually kind of liked the quality of the Rafters a little better."
"The fit of this bra is not great. I am a 30ddd and had to buy a large to fit the cups. The band is way too big, requiring constant adjustments. Also, there are no cups or even slots for cups in this bra. Really only good for sleep."
I really thought these would have more padding in the ball of foot region-not enough to warrant repurchasing at later date
"The shirt fit a little too loose for my 6 foot, 180 pound son.  He was looking for a tighter fit."
"I ordered a small hat and it was still too large... and I don't have a pin head so not sure who this is designed for but be warned.

Aside from that, a great hat, well made, very attractive and great for a Kentucky Derby Party."
Great color but not made to last.
"Great colors,really vivid but runs very large. Maybe the extra large in place of xxl?
Fabric does not really feel like silk and shirt is made in India."
"I don't really like these earrings. The gold is too golden colored, but that off color  won't be a problem when wearing. It actually gets kind of lost on the ears. The most dominant color is the rose.  The metal is not smooth and highly polished. It has a granulated Etruscan look....much like the texture in photo.

 They're not misrepresented, I made the bad choice. I prefer highly polished metals. This metal is not polished, except for the borders.  The surface has a rough feel, but the metal next to the ears is smooth and comfortable. That area is also very well plated.  These earrings are encrusted with stones; something I thought would be very attractive, but it's too much for my liking. I think less would have been better.

They're not as pretty as I thought they would be; however, they are well made. The stones are not glued in. They are bead set. The earrings are cast from solid silver and for their size, have good weight to them. The backs of earrings are not hollowed out. The post are solid and the backs fit securely. The posts are located near the top of earrings. The stones are sparkling and twinkle a lot, especially in good lighting. The earrings are the size of a dime. These sit upright on the ears.  No drooping."
"Came as expected, color was as listed but be aware they are on the large side as these puffs go!"
Cute but ironically attracts cat fur like a lent brush :(
"String broke, but my 3 year old can be a bit rough on stuff.  Material is on the cheaper side, not a long term use bag."
not orginal
Excellent quality...runs small....very shallow
"Somewhat large for me, I wear a size 7 shoe."
They are not ventilated well so they cause your feet to sweat.
I do not understand how to put this thing on sometimes. very weird fit  on the chest....
"It was hard to set,but my 10yr.old son loves it. Will not leave the house without it. Says all his friends & classmates says it's awesome."
"I have worn this is the past, but not for many years. This does ""bite"" a little between the breasts, and goes too far under my armpits for comfort."
"slips off feet, and didn't feel very good and  not much arch"
Very hard to get on and pull up!!
No weight gain so not sure why the band is so tight but good coverage and no muffin top.
"I ordered this set months ago but my anticipated travel fell through. The luggage sat unopened in the shipping box until another trip transpired; when I finally opened it I gotta say it was a letdown. I simply cannot imagine ever having to check this bag...not sure it could handle a carousel and baggage handling. The fabric is tremendously thin. A child could probably slice thru it with a pair of safety scissors. Seeing as how I take the train more than fly, this set will work for me only due to Amtrak's liberal carry-on policy. But for airlines? No way. The zippers are flimsy and the overal bag structure is more floppy than sturdy. The pull out handles do seem well done, nice action. I purchased this mainly for the polka dots as it stands out nicely making it easier to find. Another reviewer helpfully suggested putting cardboard inside by the lining and frankly, that's almost neccessary. If you prefer your luggage less DIY and more out of the box sturdy, I'd skip this. For light car or train trips when several pieces are better than one big bag or if you never need to check it, this could work. However, doublecheck the measurements!! The very largest case is still quite small at 28in. Antrak allows 36in checked bags and with airlines charging per piece for checked bags, why not get more room for your money? With the whimsical pattern and incredibly lightweight material, this is more suited for older kids off to grandma's for the summer."
"Its not for short and flat chested women.

Sad face."
It didn't fit right.  It was too tight. Amazon has the most sizes I have found.  I shop through amazon most of the time.
"In the picture, they make this shirt look like it has shape, that the arms are flowy, that it's tapered in toward the waist.  They had it tied back.  This is just a regular shaped t-shirt that will not do anything to give you shape.  If that's all you're looking for, by all means get this.  It's a nice material and comfortable."
"Ordered a small in pink. I am short 5'2 size 4-6 and these stop at about 3 inches above my ankles! Not for tall people I see. Also, the waist band is a little snug I had to really stretch it out some more so it doesn't feel like its squeezing. All in all the pockets are great and roomy and so are the pants, very baggy. Good to wear around the house."
All the shoes I've ordered from them are huge!! I have a petite daughter but geez.
This shirt is alright... the sleeves are a bit different than shown.  I purchased to go with leggings and it does cover the hip areas appropriately.
"I debated sending this back, but decided to keep it.  A bit tight in the bust but roomy elsewhere, and a good length for skinny jeans."
"No problem with the glasses themselves, but got the wrong color.  Order the orange looking ones, and got green.  Considering the price, didn't seem worth it to try to send them back and get new ones."
"I'm a healthy runner.  That's my way of saying that I carry a hefty load.  At 5'8"" and at an average of 195Lbs when I'm in decent shape.  I require a good stability shoe for running.  I have been on Brooks Addiction 10's for over the last year and finally got back into some competition (I did a sprint distance Triathlon last Sept).  I'm in mid training for a half-marathon and I'm averaging 20-25 miles per week.

I've been switching back and forth between my Addiction10 and these Spria Scorpius shoes trying very hard to figure out if they're going to work for me.

Well, the verdict is in.

Given my feet, these shoes just don't work well for a long-distance runner for me.

The fit across the top forefoot is too loose and doesn't provide me the adequate support I need.

I'm an 8.5 US with a standard width and the Scorpius in the medium width is just too wide.

The overall construction is mediocre, some of the detail patterns and leather don't appear to be in accordance to patter, an example is one of the shoelace eyelets is sewn on cockeyed...

Anyhow, I had to give these a try based on some reviews I read elsewhere, the cost compared to the Addiction10 I was running in was intriguing but I should have saved my money and stuck with what I knew worked."
Fuzzy collar is annoying.
This bra sticks well and stays put but I felt the weight of it made my breasts sag. It definitely did not lift them up.
"It's small, very small"
"a little snug in the legs, otherwise good."
"The cardigan set is okay, I would expect better quality and softer material for such brand as Carter's."
"I am 5'-7"" hight and this vest look too long when i wear, even the size correct, might because i am an asian and this for a tall guys."
It is heavy than I assumed it to be
use to get this 3 for $5!
It's a good accessory for my cat women costume but the bad hing I hate is the bad smell it has. Omg it freeking stinks !
"These are not my favorite brand, but the price was right. They fit a little strangely, as they aren't fully fitted to the foot and the body is super wide. Also, it's worth mentioning that the size 24 Month are no longer made with a snap tab at the top in order to cover the zipper. Because of this, my daughter always wakes up with her pajamas unzipped. In all, these are snuggly and warm and the price is appropriate."
Tights are better for me. Didnt last and runs small.
"I bought 3 different pair of boots at the same time, with the intention of returning 2 of them.  This pair was returned.  The boots fit OK, seemed well constructed and to fit to size around the foot.  The zipper quality seemed fine.  As a few others commented, the top of the boot at the ankle is a bit tight, but it was OK for me.  My problem with the boots was the outer sole.  When I walked in these, they felt a bit awkwardly angled, and they ""clomped"" loudly on the floor.  I think it was caused by combination of a higher heel, and a sole material that seemed more like a plastic than rubber.  Surely it's not actually plastic, but the feel and sound of walking in them was not something I wanted."
I think the scarfs are over priced. My friends would not purchase these scarfs and I would not recommend them.
The length is great but they are very loose
"it's cute but too small, I had to give like a gift because doesn't fix me"
"OK, doesn't compare to some other fashion jewelry I already own and definitely cant stand up next to my real stuff"
"These boots are what they are. They are an inexpensive model under a good brand (Steve Madden). There is little in the way of padding, so these boots aren't the most comfortable. Basically just a thin layer of leather. Not much arch support, so I wouldn't try to wear them all day. The other reviews are correct in that they do fit big. Meaning that you should order a half size smaller than usual. I normally wear a 10.5 to an 11. I ordered a size 10 and they fit good. I think they are so roomy because of a lack of padding. Sole inserts should work fine with these. My only real peeve about these boots so far are how difficult they are to put on and take off. Not sure why. They seem very tight at the opening. Overall, not a terrible purchase for the price."
"I was looking for a closed toe adventure type sandal that would be great for casual wear and hiking on nicer trails in warm weather. So this shoe looked like the perfect one. But it wasn't!
There was a lot to like about this shoe: really cute, makes large feet look smaller, a lot of micro-adjustments, great traction, large toe box and it was lightweight. Unfortunately, I decided to send these sandals back. I found that the insole had a plasticy feel and a hard ridgeline under where the toes meet the rest of the foot, but the real reason I sent them back was the diagonal straps which crossover the ball of the feet were painful. And, I wasn't sure they would stretch with time. If you notice the way the shoe is designed it seems to lift upwards in the toe area, when you put these on, the toe area flattens out increasing the tension in those diagonal straps. If they had been designed with a flatter sole this would not have been a problem as there would have been enough slack to account for actual wearing. I'm not sure if this would be a problem for everyone but it was for me. BTW, I have long slender feet."
"A little loose at the bottom, like wearing a pair of balloons."
"This is a low end low price point watch but it has a clean dial and is actually a reliable little workhorse, but sadly the men's size is way too small for men. Like most watches coming out of Japan for the American market the men's size is way too small for men and is suitable only for teenagers or young kids."
"I am normally a size 4 and the size chart said a Small was size 4-6. I ended up having to exchange for a medium. Still a bit snug, I wish I got a large."
I like the purse but the stripes kept coming apart
I returned the item bc it was soooo tiny! Ordered a 12 month size and it looks like it fits a 3 month. Quality is okay. There are better Hello Kitty pants sets out there. Keep looking!
The pants were too big in the waist.  I got a pair of the plain front at the same time and they fit great.
"I had to send this back, it was more like a little girl size"
Received shoes today.  They are exactly as they look.  I like the cushyness of the shoe.  The bottom of the shoes had several weird darkish orange marks on them...they didn't look worn and the weird marks are on the bottom of the shoe so I kept them.  Not happy about that.  I will post a complete review after I've worn the shoe.
if you have a big booty this will not cover all around you. It's a bit too long too. But good quality.
Very poor quality fabric.  Does not feel like it is supportive enough for 40D.  Will keep for laundry day...
"Says 2X or 3X, is more like a medium."
"Nice, but picks up alot of lint."
Very nice shoe. The sizes are a bit smaller than I imagined.
They are soft and comfortable but have a gap at the top. I am not sure they will work with high boots. but I hve a few pairs of lower ones I think they will look good with.
really really too  short
The shirt fits large especially around the neckline.
Kind of tight. Will give it a little bit of time to possibly stretch some.
Its comfy but the pads always come out and bunch it. Its a pain and cant get them in anymore.
Just ok. Very Cheap..
"These socks are adorable and are a soft material, but we haven't gotten much use out of them because the ankle holes are too big/elastic isn't tight enough. The socks fall right off his feet."
"oh G  we order March 9 and we just have it wooooooooow  -- but honestly so cute this item I love it
thank you"
"Shoes may be a little large....I fell on black ice Saturday and not able to walk much yet.  When my knee gets better, I will try them out."
"I have double wide feet so they are a  bit small but usable. Sole is decent, but over all the sandal is just OK. I ordered more than one model and find this alternative to be excellent:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B002KKCZS8/dp/B002KKCZS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B002KKCZS8</a>"
"Serves its purpose, nothing too much to brag about with the shoe. She has worn them at least 3 times and no complaints so far."
"There's very little stretch and inseam is low.  I'm a size 6 pants and these fit, but with short inseam, rides down when I sit."
Color was not what I was looking for. Returned.
"Love the material and colors.  I normally wear a size 20 which usually is a 2x and fits fine.  this dress was snug around the hips.  I will have to cut it and raise the skirt part up on the bodice to give it some more hip room.  Too bad I have to do this work, because I love the dress."
I would like it better if it were scoop neck in the back as well.
"This is a really pretty bra, and I love the quality and design of the Warner's lift bras (the little lift pad is genius), but this style runs so much smaller than all the other Warner's bras I've gotten.  I always buy the same size, but this one is tiny, at least a full size smaller, both in band size and cup size, than the other Warner's bras in the same size."
I hoped it would be tight and soft. nope. it's loose and just feels like regular jersey cloth. it's... ok.
"it is a lot smaller than one would think, but we used it for our 21 month's old halloween costume, red riding hood and it was great!  one thing, is the zipper and ease of getting stuff in and out of it are not great, but it was more for show for us."
the dress is pretty but it gives me an empire waist. not something I was looking for. I feel like I need to buy a wider belt to give me more of a cinch in the center and give that slimming affect.
"It fits ok for sun tanning, but too loose in the shoulders for water aerobics!!  The material feels quite thick - not flimsy."
super short
With of coat is wider than it appears on the photos. Will have to spend more money to have it tailored
This bra fits ok. It wasn't too tight in the band as often happens (I measure a true 38A) but the cup area was just too loose--sort of sloppy feeling. I get better support from pull-on bralettes. I also found the band to be too flimsy to avoid rolling up--not comfortable. The bra is thin so it wouldn't cover headlights under lightweight tops either.
"It's okay, but its not as tight fitting.  I don't like the big hole in the middle and it slips up when you're moving exposing body parts. It's also cotton like a teeshirt...not as flattering as it looks in the photo."
Absolutely no support.  Cute but I need a little help.
Well it is very stretchy. Like the length and the length of the sleeves. It is comfortable but just not all that attractive on me.  Nice orange color.
Fits really tight
"This dress is a very pretty color, great fabric and perfect length. However, it just wasn't very flattering on me. I am 5'2"" and typically wear an XS and 00. I felt like the seam at the bust didn't look flattering. A dress this expensive should be very flattering in my book."
"Color and materials is fine, but it is small/thin."
"These sun glasses are nice looking but I was disappointed that the color they are selling as Blue looks more like the picture that they have included that says green.

The glasses look like $15 sunglasses with a round ""John Lennon"" look to them.

In my opinion they are more of a novelty item than actually for sun protection.

They say they are unisex and I bought them for my husband but think that the lenses are a bit close together for a man's face.

Mostly though I was disappointed that the color does not match what I thought I was getting. The color was labeled ""blue"" so I guess that is just the color.

Thanks for reading my review

*I received these glasses free as a sample to review"
I wore these for an anniversary dinner and every time I took a step the Velcro came loose.
I'm 100% sure that one of the shoes is a different size than the other. They both are stamped with the same size but they don't fit the same. I have no problem with other shoes (other Naturalizers even) fitting this way so I know it's not my feet being different sizes. They are still comfortable as ever. Love Naturalizers.
"This coat is a cute style, & being longer keeps your rear-end & upper thighs covered.
I bought an XL. I am 5'7, 175 lbs well distributed weight and wear 38C bra.
Found this fit a little tightly, espec chest & arms.
The sleeve length was long enough which was nice.
Had a little trouble with the zipper & had to work it a bit each time to zip up.
This has 2 zippered outer pockets, & 2 nice inside cell phone pockets, and the hood fits great & stays in place.
It covers your neck to right under your chin which would be wonderful except it poked me a bit.
Wanted to love this coat, however it failed me in the most important feature....not warm!
 At only 36 degrees out walking my dog for just 15 minutes I was quite cold.
Will be returning."
"The material is very thin, but they don't cost much, and beautiful colors."
Great color and feel great on
"These are good sandals. I don't want to pulverize the ratings just because they run large, and I didn't know it. Just make sure you are cautious when ordering."
its very stretchy... I like them them tight.  Should have sized down instead of up. But  its fine.
"Everything about the boot is good, but they do dig in the heel some, like others have suggested. I haven't tested out the snake proof feature though - hopefully I won't have to."
"Your bang is to short for big people,  Need a longer band on it.  I can not wear it around my waist line.  Need wider straps.  The bag is o.k."
Sides very thin. I like more support on sides.
"Some strands look nice, but small black strand and the white one look cheap.  Since all plastic beads on thin elastic, you might be prepared for them to break quickly. Colors are nice."
Bought this for a trip across the pond.  Works well.  Only used once.
Too much extra material/ gathers. Sent back.
"Tights ran somewhat small, they were only purchased for a photoshoot but they ripped very easily when going on because of them running small and I was not able to salvage any pairs for future use after one wear."
I wear a size 14; ordered a 2XL and it is way too small and the shoulder part is very uncomfortable.
Ring doesn't hold you well!
Shoe fits a little large..
"cute look and modest. but the quality of the fabric is very light and you might need to wear something under the top. Also, I had to iron the skirt and the petty coat on synthetic setting on my iron. Took FOREVER, however it was worth it in the end and the price of the garment offset the time I spent.  Nice look from the traditional pink."
"I like these, I just don't think they were worth $20. I could have paid half that for twice as many shirts by another brand. I was expecting something nicer for that price, my bad"
"I bought several colors of these suits and while I loved the colors, I had to return all of them due to weird sizing.  :(
Bottoms too large, top too large in the band but a bit small in the cups.
For reference I'm 5 ft 5 in, weigh 107, wear size 24 in jeans, size 00 in womens, size 1 in juniors.
Wish they'd let us order tops & bottoms separate but since I'm a 32D up top I don't think it would work for me anyway unless they specifically start making them for bra sizes.  Oh well, if you can get the right fit it's a GREAT bargain!"
"product is fine, runs a little on the large side, color is as shown,"
"I had to send these back because they were stiff and where the top eyelet is actually was going to dig into the side of my foot. I never wore them, only tried them on when I got them. Bummed because I liked the color and I love Nike Shox's."
cute but tarnished fast
"For some reason the upper portions of these jeans are super snug. Not ""ha ha because you're fat"" snug. The waist is fine. The pocket area is far too tight for the kind of jeans that these are. Once my phone, wallet, and keys are loaded they're too tight. I have other trousers cut similarly with plenty of room in that area. It's just a weird design decision. I wouldn't buy these again, but otherwise they are solid quality."
"I bought this wallet for a gift. I was originally attracted to the ""grey"" color as it appeared on my screen.  In person it's more of a tan/grey, not what I expected. I am keeping it and hopefully the color works out ok."
It is small for a size 9.
Kinda thin and scratchy material
The Fluidfeel II are the new version of the Fluidfeel . I will have to run on them for awhile and let you know how they felt later. I ran and hiked in the Fluidfeel II for about three months and this pair was disappointing. Several of the front lugs have fallen off since they were glued on and not molded into the sole. My original fluidfeels are over a year old and have only lost a few lugs and have a hundred more miles on them. I'm trying to get Amazon or Montrail to warranty them since they have a one year warranty. I'm hoping these were just a pair of lemon shoes made on a Monday or Friday.
"They were a gift for my sister, and although they are the cutest boots yet, they were too small for her, so unfortunately, I must return."
"Most people on here were saying how small these pants ran, so I was excited that they might just fit me. The pants are beautiful but way to big. I'm not even too sure I can have them altered. I'm so sad."
"It works great. What I don't like is the smell and the fact that when it arrived there was note saying that it is made of product found hazardous for health by California. If I had seen that before buying, I would not have."
"If you want a loose fit, these are for you.  I find they get baggy very quickly and I wanted something that was more compressive."
Very soft like slacks
"Does anyone else have this problem, right shoe has less platform than left shoes, so I weighed and right shoe weighs 6.8oz and left weighs 7.3 of, tried two pairs, same issue
Though it's very pretty looking, look like dress sandals, but don't fit well"
"These shoes fit well and they have quality construction for such a simple design....however, they start to stink after a few exposures to salt water. If you wash them, they don't fall apart and they stop stinking for a couple of weeks. Good price, but I will probably look for something else when they wear out (or I get tired of the smell)."
Hard to get the foot in. Too tight at instep
great size purse
"They are alright, but just not for me. It was just a little too much."
"These pants are very well made,  but run very, very small in the thighs and butt.  I would say to order at least two sizes up."
"These thongs are a bit awkward. They fit as expected around the band, but the triangle that covers the vulva is very very small making them pretty uncomfortable. They also started to fray a bit after a few washes. They're alright for the price, but I don't intend to buy them again."
"They are exactly as depicted, just a slight difference in color, but very minor. However, two of them are impossible to unscrew the little top part, making them unusable. Was so disappointed because I only order it for the white gem piercing and that one is one that won't come apart :("
The last one I got the same size and it was a little larger and fit me better...
"very comfy, but no depth to the sole, so it makes the feet hurt when walking on hard surfaces for a length of time.  I have wide feet, and this fit great.  there is some elastic at the top part so even socks fit inside with my feet, or i can go barefoot in the shoe.  very much a fabric shoe, and will drink rain pretty fast."
I bought 3 pairs of Bobs on the day that I purchased this pair. This is the only style that feels stiff and rubs in the back.  Still a good shoe but requires more breaking in than the others.
this bra is pretty and very comfortable. the issue I have is the elastic straps which offer no support at all..not sure who thought bras for big busted women(38G) with elastic straps is a good idea. I will keep it but if I had realized they were elastic I would not have ordered it. everything just bounces up and down when I move.
"Good, the clip eventually gets naked and hurts and damage the paper money"
These are sloppy on the foot.  Not comfortable - look good - but not comfortable.
"A little heavy, pulls my lobes down..."
"Decent wallet with a decent feel, I hope the RFID works. The wallet is extremely small. Can only get 6 cards plus my ID in it total. And the leather pulls out when removing a card. Not worth the price."
"It is very pretty stone. I would give it 5 stars for the ring itself, but I have to point out the fact it constantly turning my figure green that I have to take couple points off."
"I was looking for a wireless nursing bra for at night, this is a very comfortable fit, but the straps aren't quite long enough for me so the back rides up and I don't like that. Would be best fit for those more petite in the chest/shoulders."
The length is fine but they are too narrow.
"Fits perfect,  is very soft and comfortable but after two months the trim is beginning to fray!"
"The sweater itself is very pretty, the color and design is just as pictured, and the fabric is very soft and comfy.  HOWEVER, it is MUCH, MUCH smaller than described and does not match the provided size chart.  It is also much shorter than expected.
Based on other reviews I DID order a larger size (I normally wear a size 14/XL and have a 38D cup size, and I ordered this in a 2X).  It so small that I don't think a 3X would even fit properly.
In my opinion, unless you're a very petite girl with a small chest, I wouldn't recommend this item."
"I ordered the royal blue in a size small and it looks like a large, but since you can get away with ""flowy"" styles these days I will give it a whirl. Warning, shipping is very slow.
Received at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Boots were too tight
It was too big above the breast area.
Returned...they were to small...the color was cool just didn't fit right
"The jacket is SHORT. It was initially purchased for a 12 year old but due to the lack of length of this jacket, I gave it to my 9 year old son. If I couldn't pass it down, I would have returned it."
"The color of the blue is not what I was hoping for. It is a very royal blue color or even brighter. I was hoping for it being dark blue. It won't be my go to watch, like I was hoping for."
I bought these for the zippered pouches so the squares for me were a bonus. I gave this 3 stars because the zipper broke on one of the squares before I even left on my trip. The other two held up fine but I was very cautious with them the whole trip. No problems with the pouches. They served their purpose and helped me keep my things organized. These are definitely lower quality than some of the other brands out there.
Nice shirt.  Seems like a fake Dickies.  Thin and not as rugged as a normal Dickies.  Much smaller than a normal Dickies shirt.
"Nice shoes, but canot fit .i ordered a 10 but yet the my heel  hangs off in an obvious way.... really like this shoes tho, wish i would change it for a bigger size, since clearly i order the one kind of  10"
Alittle baggy
"The product does eliminate the odor in my shoes.  It does have a nice citrus-like scent.  It does not prevent further funkification of the footwear.

Basically, I take my shoes off, I spray them, they are defunkified.

I wear them once, and they are re-funkified.

I bought this product because of reviews stating that it kept their shoes odor free for days at a time.  Not so for I of nas-TAY foot funkification...  Blech..."
"looked OK, but way too small."
little larger than I expected but they are cute
"The photos of the interior of this bag leave out one important detail. It is not evident from the pictures how your suits or any hanging items are affixed to the top lid of the suitcase and folded up. The loop for the hangers is in absolutely the wrong position. It is opposite of where it should be, making it very difficult to load first of all. You have to lay the suitcase flat on a bed or on the floor. You cannot tilted up on a luggage rack at home or in a hotel and properly load any hanging items. The loop should be at the ""top"" of the lid closest when closed to the front and the carrying handle of the suitcase. Since I carry suits almost always when I travel this makes this suitcase very inconvenient and I am very sad that I purchased it.

That is the only reason. It is well constructed, roles easily and has a nice solid handle with good ergonomics. If you don't carry any hanging items or they are just shirts or blouses you can probably be okay but this is a serious design flaw in my estimation and the photographs do not let you know about this."
I was extremely surprised that the Mimosa Glee walking shoes hurt my feet and I had to return them.  I really hated it because they are a good looking shoe.  Each shoe hurt my foot in a different spot.  I own the Merrell hiking shoes and absolutely love them.  But they are considerably wider in the toe area than the walking shoes were.  So I suppose that is the reason.  Right after I purchased my Merrell hiking shoes I put them on and went off to Europe on a walking tour and loved them.  Thank heavens I didn't try that stunt with the walking shoes.
"Slightly tight in the hips. However, had to be shortened as leg length was too long."
"they are a bit snug, but they have to be as they will stretch with wear and if they are total comfort at the start i expect like all other tennis shoes that they will be too large before they wear out.  i've had 7 foot surgeries and can't stand to have my fit slide around.  i need firm support.  if indeed they don't stretch i will be sorry i didn't go bigger, but only time will verify that.  i feel the shoes are too expensive for what they are and i hate paying for the name.  with the law suits i can't find all the other brands that i was buying for 18.00-35.00.  if they were more reasonable i would have purchased 4 or 5 pair."
"This shoe is comfortable and didn't need any ""break-in"" time. I bought them for work as a server. Unfortunately they are too soft and ended up causing much pain due to lack of support on had floors. Being on my feet for 5 to 8 hours a day was too much for these. The rubber soles were fairly slip-resistant which was nice. The downside, when they get wet from wet floors, they stink horribly. They also wore out very quickly. Holes in the bottoms and holes by my pinky toe within 6 to 8 weeks. So maybe comfortable for day to day errands or walking for short time frames but not good for extended wear."
"The bras have great coverage, which I was surprised.  Nice material, fits nicely, and the straps stay up.  Gives me good support, and my tops look great on me.  The only thing I do not like about these bras is that the wiring, on the sides, sticks into my armpit. It is not a bra that I would wear for everyday, all day long.  This part of it is too uncomfortable.  They are bras that I wear out, when I want to have more support, and cleavage."
This is really the one what is relevant my job however it is a bit wide. But I keep wearing it.
Too small & the elastic didn't stretch at all.  not the type of tutu I expected.
not sure what size this is one was to small and one was great
"Wife loves it, that's what matters."
"I should have read the reviews more carefully.  The pocket on this shirt is GIGANTIC.  It look awkward it's so big.  I did like the fit and material, though.  I'm 5'8 and am always looking for longer tops.  Just wish they would get rid of the hideous pocket."
After wearing them for a while they stretched out and became too big.
"[NOTE: I am including my original review, as I have not gone through the process of having the watch repaired, but I'm not very happy right now: MY WATCH STOPPED WORKING. I am going to keep up with how the warranty is handled, repairs, cost, etc. But I am upset: I treated this watch well and the it just stopped. I will allow my original review to follow, even though I've dropped my points down two, to 3 stars. ""Time"" will tell if I raise it or lower it.}

MY ORIGINAL REVIEW
The Kronen & Sohne Black Retro Pocket Watch is a really neat little watch  in the interest of honesty I must tell you I was given mine for Christmas, and therefore I suppose I am prone to treasure it beyond its actual commercial value. Even so, I believe I can be honest.

It is physically striking: its etched black surface is very ornate, even busy. Personally, though, I like it: it seems as if it is the type of watch I would find, say, in a cigar box within a footlocker full of my grandfathers belongings. In this world of electronic and digital devices, here is a throwback: a wind-up clock with ornate symbols etched all over it. Like an orrery of the physical universe, it is a seemingly antiqued gear-driven timepiece that is as much a working clock as it is a piece of memorabilia.

But does it work? Simply put, yes  if you pay attention to winding it every morning. Ive only owned mine for a week and a day, and my first three days did not go well, as I found that I needed to retrain myself to follow a daily routine with it. But since I followed a certain regimen I wind it when I I take it out in the morning and when I put it down at night  its been keeping perfect time. Granted, thats only four days, but its worked fine nonetheless.

But getting back to its looks, I must say I really love it. Im a steampunk reader who isn't maniacal about it  I haven't gone out and bought any old Dickensian clothes or anything, but I do admire the throwback quality of it all, the fun of a neat gear-driven device like this. I love the glass window, the hinged door, the visible gearwork one can see through the back, the blue-tinged etchingtheres something lovely and antiquated about it all. The clock works fine for me, and I really enjoy its physical  attractiveness. As to its duration, only time will tell. If you read nothing else after this sentence, its still working fine."
Kind of scratchy.  Bought it for my husband but he doesn't like it as much as his plain t-shirts
The socks are okay. Not the warmth or comfort I was looking for.
Ivory is kind of yellow not ivory  at all
It's smaller than pictured.  It's ok.
Solid attachment but easy to bend nail while installing.
"The dress came in on time but, it has a huge run in the back that is very noticeable. I will be exchanging it. It fits beautifully and is a very well made dress."
I love the look but the fit sucks. The post is way to long for me. Either the earing droops or the pin pokes me in the head.... I stil wear them though. ;)
"Nice contrasting colors on the shoe. The brogueing is not overdone. Fit is pretty good. Burnishing on the toe used to be better, but there is still a hint of it. Doesn't really look like a high end shoe, but it is an oxford style. The leather looks kind of plasticky and sole is TPU. The shock absorption is good and grip is decent, but adds to the plastic look."
I wear a18/20 in pants. Ordered the 3x in these. They fit great in the waist but are very tight in the thigh. The material is very nice though. I am returning these.
The shoe run big - it's heavy
"What impressed me the most is this shoes sleek low profile style.  Is available in many colors.  Thinking about purchasing  a pair in both black, and brown.  May be snug."
"i wanted to like these shoes soooo bad. i have super narrow feet and ordered the Medium width and they were too narrow for me. the length was expected, in Saucony i wear 8, but in other shoes i wear 7.5.
i expected more arch support, but i have extremely high arches, i have custom orthodics but couldn't fit them into the shoe because the width was so narrow."
Next time I will buy smaller.
"Between sizes, size up. Not a lot of arch support but nice and cushy on heels."
"These run a little big than my previous purchase.  Maybe they will shrink a little after a couple of wash.  Great, comfortable fit."
"First I ordered the large, which is what I should wear according to the capezio chart. They were too big, so I ordered the medium. They do fit better, but I feel that they are no better than other brands I have that cost much less. In terms of texture and compression, they still cling to some tops and the compression is the same as any other legging I have. Not overly impressed."
Size was a little small. I could only wear it once.
Tight on hips.
"Unfortunately I have a big head and I think this runs average size so too small for me. Also, this hat is VERY LARGE and very stiff.  I was looking for something a little more on the foldable or crushable side and not quite so massive.  Probably cute for the right occasion though."
"Ordered a size small, fits more like a medium. Material seems fairly sturdy for an economy duster."
"I love the Ariat brand and I love turquoise, so I was excited to order this belt.  I wear a size 12 jeans and the large belt fit perfectly.  The buckle is solid and it fits into the belt hole with a straight piece of metal that has a ball at the end.  The ball is large enough that the buckle feels secure and not like it's going to pop open while I'm wearing it.  The colors looked the same in person as they did on my computer, and the turquoise seems like it's not going to fall out any time soon.

As much as I love how the buckle looks, it sticks out pretty far, and more on one side than the other.  When I wear it with a longer shirt, it looks like I have a huge circle sticking out from my abdomen.  I wear a lot of these style belt buckles, and none of them stick out as far as this one.  If you're planning on wearing a shirt that's shorter in the front to show off the belt, this will be a non-issue.  Overall, the belt seems like a decent quality for the price, but because the buckle sticks out so far, I find myself wearing my other belts instead."
"Super soft & looks cute, but not a great fit if you're busty."
"I ordered these to take on a trip to Italy where I will be doing ALOT of walking on different kinds of terrain ( wet/sloping/uneven etc..).  I needed a pair of waterproof shoes/boots in case it rains and I thought instead of taking multiple pairs of shoes these would fit the bill for everything I would need.. They are fine for a couple of hours but then my feet start hurting...I will be walking 8-10 hours a day to different locations on my trip.  I am trying different insoles in the boots but so far ..it's a no go...I read all the reviews for these boots before I bought them and the only negative I read was about them being a little slick on wet flooring..I found this to be true on tile flooring.  I also read you could take these straight out of the box and wear them all day with no break in period and your feet wouldn't hurt, NOT true.  I have been trying to wear these all day, every day, since I received them but cannot make it.  They are true to size though.  Another cpl of days of wearing these boots and then I am going to sit them in the closet and hunt something else.  I just hate I payed so much money for  them and they will be at home in my closet while I am on my trip.  Goes to show you the reviews are not always accurate."
"Disclaimer: Amazon Vine Review Product.

This quartz-movement watch face is nicely designed.  I enjoy the depth and sophistication of the face.  However, I am rather disappointed with the silicone straps that reeked of the oily rubbery odor of an automotive tire.  The stiff straps overall cheapens the watch.  A metal or leather band would allow this watch to be worn on a formal occasion.  On a side note, the face is a smidgen too big for a small wrist."
Good quaility snd color but they are generous in size.
"it is good , however when i wear it outside it always get lots of dirt inside and i have to brush it
too easy to get dirty
but vey comfortable"
"They were cute, no doubt about it, but I had to send them back because they were just too small.  I am a reliable size 11, and these felt more like a 10."
"I like the way this dress fits, the material is very cheap looking."
The leather was alittle bumpy on the left foot but not that noticeable so I'm keeping it. But I expected to be no flaws.
It's not as shiny as the pic and a lot of stresks
"It is a top that is very loose. It is a side split exposure shirt. It is very loose around the abdomen. It is stylish in design, but very loose."
"Pretty thing, but they are strong. It hurst my fingers to tighting them down when tying"
"Bought this in orange after having a black purse insert for quite some time. The black made it dark and hard to see what was inside. The orange works so much better, naturally illuminates the inside. My main complaint with this is that the material is really floppy! It's thin and doesn't keep it's shape as you move your hand around the purse, getting things in and out. A friend suggested that I use Velcro on the inside of my purse to hold up the sides of this insert. I did this by attaching stick on Velcro to both sides of my purse and onto the sides of the insert. This holds the sides up much better and I can still unattach it if I need to get to something on the outside of the organizer. It still moves around more than my old black one but works better than before. All in all...I might look for something a bit thicker next time but the bright colors for seeing what you have inside can't be beat."
Had a very bad reaction. Do not get these if you have allergies. Very cute though and everything came in perfectly.
"Cute set, however, the pants definitely appear white in picture, but they are light tan."
"Note: I love my shoes and my boots.  And I will try anything in fashion once.

I got these in the hunter green and the coloring was gorgeous.  I slipped them on and they fit okay, but they hurt the soles of my feet!  The design of the boot is nice- slouchy, relaxed- great to be paired with rolled up jeans and/or a lazy skirt... presumably.

STYLE:
- the boot came up mid calf.  I have long legs (36"" inseam), but I've found a few pairs of boots that reach my knees at least.  These came up to mid calf, which had a way of cutting my long legs in half, making me look awkward.  I tried to pull up the ""foldover"" part of the boot and even with that up, they still barely reached the bottom of my knee cap.
- The slouchy design is wicked cute.  I wished these fit me right.
- the rounded toe and the flat foot paired with the slanted rise of the front of the shoe for the top of you foot, makes the shoe look like an elf shoe.  (especially in the green color, unfortunately.  I maybe should have picked a different color for my first Steve Madden flat boots)

COMFORT:
- the sole of the boot is really hard.  The foot casing cuts into the backs of my heels/ ankles.
- I ordered a size 8 (which is my typical sneaker size) and they were a little big for me.  If you're borderline sizes, order down.
- there was plenty of room for the calves, even when the top of the boot hit right in the ""meat"" of my calf muscle.
- the shoe is so flat that it actually hurts my foot.  There is no arch support whatsoever.  Could be just me, but I guess I really can't do flat boots.  If  you have high arches, these aren't the shoes for you.

SHIPPING:
5 out of 5
- I got these shoes within 3 business days during the christmas season.  I ordered on a Thursday, one WEEK before christmas, and got them on Monday, BEFORE christmas.  Fantastic. No damages to the packaging.  They were in their own little plastic sleeves, stuffed with foam and cardboard to preserve shaping.  Then they were put in a shoe box, and put into another box for shipping.  Great service.

The style of the shoe is cute.  The idea of the shoe is great.  The reality of the shoe is not so much.  I will be returning these and looking for a different style of boot.  :)"
"With larger busts, it just hangs there making it look like a potato sack. LOVE the details and the dress was beautiful, just not for my body shape."
"I love the color and the fabric. This shoe fits larger than other similar Sketchers that I own. I think the difference is the fabric has more stretch in this shoe than the other shoes I have that are more dense. So, if you like these shoes, I would buy a half size smaller if I ordered this shoe again."
"I do not like this item the fabric is too thin, and the size are not accurate,"
It's OK thought it would have been bigger my other charms swallow it up but I did want a cross on my bracelet so I'll keep it
The best thing about them is that they are warm. I thought they would be longer but only go to my calf and the don't have any elastic at the top so they fall down.
Beautiful dress except the tear in the seam in the shoulder on the left side. Luckily my mother can sew it and fix it for me. I don't have time to find another dress for my friends wedding soon but other than that fits perfect!
The legs are somewhat large and doesn't fit the jean style but still love them would just snuggle the legs up alittle
Product looks and feels cheap. May be returning. I can get something better at a Walmart
"So I ordered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/InCharacter-Baby-Lil-Monster-Costume/dp/B004UPU1I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">InCharacter Baby Lil' Monster Costume</a>&nbsp;for my 22 month old and since I was running out of monster costume options, I settled on this for my 3 year old. It. Was. Snug. Even though I went by size recommendation and he only had a tee shirt and skinny jammy pants underneath, it was not a roomy fit. No biggie, it was only for one evening, but the tail didn't stay on - we ended up safety pinning it -  and aside from being tight, the jumper was short in the pants. Hey, the hat fit well. It wasn't a terrible costume (you get what you pay for) but I would suggest sizing up, especially if you want your kid wearing clothing underneath it. Pictured on the left is the Disney Pixar costume."
Shoes look nice but the inside is bubble gum pink. My costume is purple and black . Will have to change to all black costume. Keeping the shoes but not what expect. They also have them  in purple. Would love to change the color but after I bought the shoes price for the purple increased more than double. Go for purple
"Beautiful suit. However it was way too small. I ordered a 3X, but apparently it wasn't a 3X in US measurements"
"Quite narrow & tight and uncomfortable. Also, it looks more grayish thank black.  Felt like poorly made with rough material that you would buy for $35!"
"Dionysia's daughter-

These pants are definitely cute, but, not if you're my size. I'm 5'7"", about 170lbs with thicker-thighs and a decent booty. If you're built like me the pants are gonna be too short and pull around your thighs and it really won't be comfortable. I feel like these would be great if you're say, about 5'5"" or below, and don't weigh over 150lbs. The material also feels rather thin and I think if I actually tried to wear them I'd get a nice Spongebob rip when I'd go to sit down.

I can't give them a poor review, since they're too small for me. But for if you're a smaller sized person, these would be great, especially for the price."
"From the description-""100% brand new by FeelinGirl store,every corset comes with FeelinGirl tag."" Tag says made in China,  not feelin girl.

I will update my review when I see how it fits. Was disappointed that the tags don't match... hope it's not junk."
sadly the prodcut starts to fall apart after a month of use in some areas.
"cute but it hits my knees and I'm 5'4"". I wanted a mini sun dress."
"Adorable until you wash it... I bought this for my 3yo, so of course inevitably it was going to need to be washed at some point. There were no directions so I did the hand wash cycle on my washer and all of the appliqu pulled partially off (see photo).  I'm really bummed because the dress is really cute, or was. My daughter is still going to love it but it's really disappointing."
"Love this navy color,  i only use it when i need to be in cold places but sometimes because it is somehow big but functional."
"I wanted a grey leather band like the Amazon photo, but the band is definitely taupe colored, not a true grey (see photo with grey leather background, it has much more brown in the band). I'm disappointed with that because true grey with the rose gold would be a prettier and more modern combination (in my opinion). The watch also does not have a second hand, which I didn't realize until I received it (even though it doesn't claim to have one, so that's on me). Sometimes you want to time something for a number of seconds and obviously you can't do that with this watch. Nonetheless, it is still nice looking, comfortable to wear, and seems to work just fine."
"The pendant is very pretty. I don't like the chain, it is not very fluid."
"Not really comfortable like my other slides.  It's okay, but not great."
"Good looking, good quality, great priced boot as long as you don't have athletic calves!  Unfortunately, was unable to get the zipper all the way up."
"Not a comfortable suit and quality is definitely sub-par. I wouldn't recommend if you have a smaller chest, the cups are pretty big and weren't flattering on me. I'm 5'1 112lbs, small on top fuller on the bottom."
"The fit was a bit on the small side, and it doesn't have as much support as my other strapless bra. Other than that, this is a pretty good strapless bra."
"I like the feel and look. However, the sizing runs large. I ordered a 10 and then returned it for a size smaller. I also have a narrow heal and the shoe stills slips on my one foot."
"This robe was for my brother (Hallowen costume), and he's 1.82 mts tall, and the robe is so short. I think it's for short people. The quality is good but I doubt very durable."
It's a pretty dress. It runs so small and the zipper stuck. I sent it back.
"I have other, back closure, vanity fair bras that fit well. This front closure type doesn't fit as well and you get a bit of breast spill over in the front. More like a demi bra fit"
the cushioning and support were great. i would of kept them if the toe box didn't cut circulation of to my toes.
Fabric bunches up in odd ways. I have compression shirts from other brands that don't...
They were my size but too tight on the width so I returned them
"I recently bought this belt (at discount, in exchange for an honest review) and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Working-Person-s-Tan-Leather-Work-Belt/dp/B01CDE8JPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Working Person's Tan Leather Work Belt</a>&nbsp;together. Where the tan work belt is incredibly thick and strong (the ""Incredible Hulk"" of belts, as far as I'm concerned), this belt isn't quite as tough, but it's a lot better looking (dare I whisper, ""Captain America?"") than it's heavy duty brother.

This belt is quite a bit darker (dark brown) than its tan cousin, and the stitching really stands out (in a good way...not in a ""don't wear those pants with that shirt sort of way""). The belt has an elegant look that belies its underlying strength. That said, the price is a little higher than I would typically pay for a belt of this design and quality. I typically go through several belts every year, and often spend $20-$25 for a belt of this caliber at big discount stores.

It's about 3/16"" thick (~4 mm), which is fairly par for the course, although I don't often get a belt that has as sleek of a design as this one. The belt thickness works with both my belt-carried tool organizer and handgun as well as other belts I own (with the exception of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tan-Leather-Work-Belt/dp/B01CDE8JPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tan Leather Work Belt</a>). I wasn't overwhelmed with the quality of this belt, but it's not a wimp by any means. It's a good-looking work belt that should last for a while. I'll update my review when I find out just how long that ""while"" is."
"I received this as a gift.
The color was nice and I really liked the fabric, but even after steaming, twice, it still managed to look ""rumpled"".  Not a good look for this fabric and cut.  And I could see how it would pill fairly easily, esp along the cuff and under the arms.

One seam in the front skirt was a bit twisted, and wouldn't lay right which also helped make it look rumpled and sort of cheaply made.
Buttons were very loose and I could see them needing to be resewn rather quickly.

Sizing was odd, at least for me. I had enough room in the chest and waist that if I didn't want to use the buttons to keep the coat closed, I didn't have to, the belt did a good job holding it closed.  The shoulders and arms were a bit tight, especially for how ample the XL was in the chest and waist. I would not have been able to wear a heavy sweater under this and been able to move my arms much, certainly not to reach across to adjust a purse strap or anything, not without stressing the seams.  I do have sort of beefy arms and wide shoulders.  But I bought an XL to take that into account.  I'm 5'7 and 165lbs.  A large is my normal light jacket size and I like an XL for winter coats.

With the poor fit, the rumpled look and the less than awesome attention to detail, I decided to return it.  And got myself the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laundry-By-Shelli-Segal-Women-s-Wool-Fit-and-Flare-Wool-W-Faux-Fur-Trimmed-Hood-Navy-X-Large/dp/B01KPRP796/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laundry By Shelli Segal Women's Wool-Fit and Flare Wool W/Faux Fur Trimmed Hood, Navy, X-Large</a>.  And I am so happy I did!  That is the coat we've all been looking for!"
"I ordered this to wear underneath my wedding dress. I was disappointed when I took it out of the package because it looks cheap. I mean, you get what you pay for. It's still useable so I'm not too worked up about it. I wear size L tops, my bra size is 38D, and my waist is 30"" I ordered the XXL according to the size chart and it fit as expected."
My teenager loves them. They are very pretty. They arrived with a hook ready to fall out. I put it back in and hope it holds. It is inexpensive so can't complain too much. Also bought the matching heart necklace. She wore it constantly and eventually it broke. I've bought her another one with the earrings for her birthday.
This is cute and fits well but I can't wear it because rhe material is not soft and very itchy. The edges of each fray is like small cardboard cut outs.
The mesh material makes the hat look like it has a hint of a blue color to it. I needed all white.
"nice, as advertised, but orange color is a little more yellow than appears in picture"
I bought this for my daughter. She liked it ok
"The shoes are o.k.  They  are however definitely NOT worth the price.  They are basicly shiny flats with rubbery bottom.  The heel on the pair I received is not anything like the one pictured.  Not that the one pictured is a major heel, but I cannot stand flats and these are essentially flats.  I cannot imagine why the cost is as high as it is.  There is zero arch support or any support to the foot.  I would say that these are much more like a fancy shiny looking slipper.  I would not order these again and would not recommend them to anyone else."
"These were made for teens I think, not adults, unless you are tiny and stick thin. They are very thin, cheap material, and wear more like leggings than yoga pants.  Not very flattering, or comfortable for that matter."
The legs are to big!
I got this watch because the red face attracted my eye -- and the price was good. Normally I would have given it four stars but I took one off for Invicta's habit of putting bogus MSRP on the their products. This things lists for $595. Bull$***. Go to a big box store with $600 and you'll get a much nicer watch. But for $48 I like this just fine.
"its a beautiful hip scarf however, some of the coins and strings fell off."
These are nice quality shorts but the fit is definitely much bigger than I had anticipated.
Color fade
Would have been great if it had t of broke right away. Key chain part fell off. This was a gift for son-in-law.
"VERY SMALL.  THE CLAPS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OPEN AND SHUT, THE HOLE IS TOO SMALL."
"The wig was terrible!! Too small (and I have a small head) and the Princess Leia buns were hanging off like dog ears! Could not use it.  I even tried to attach them better, but to no avail.
 The collar was not the same as shown.  It was a little ""v"" neck, not like the cowl neck shown in the picture. Belt worked fine."
fits small but good quality.
"First & foremost...I big ole feet...I think my feet are as wide as they are long...so...I always have to buy extra wide shoes.  Rather than buy the customary New Balance shoes...I decided to try AVIA 4x Wide shoes.
****************************
I found the AVIA 4x wide shoe just too narrow.  Perhaps there isn't a standard set...I have no clue...I can say this shoe narrows significantly as it approaches the apex (toe area).  Other than being slight too narrow...the shoe is very comfortable and fits nicely.
****************************
I would recommend the AVIA shoes...but if you have ""big ole"" feet like me...pay particular attention to how the toe width feels prior to making your final decision.  GOOD LUCK!!!"
"I have these same shoes in tan.  I just don't understand why there would be a difference in the sizes.

I had to return for a larger size.  However, now the shoes are little too wide.  I did decide to keep because i do love how comfortable the shoe are - despite the width."
"OVERALL A CUTE PURSE, BUT NOT AS BIG/LARGE AS EXPECTED BUT WORTH THE PRICE... NO ZIPPER!!"
"My feet are lightly on the flat feet side, so you have arch problems or flat feet
this shoe is not for you"
"Arch support and cushioning are not what I was expecting. It's ok, but I prefer more as I stand and walk on concrete 9 hours every day."
"Good product, nice quality....it just doesn't fit on me as well as I had hoped it would"
"Good for the price, wasn't in a very good package though"
Had to return. They were too small. Was disappointed because they were really nice
On earring fit nice the other the back doesn't fit snug.  I am afraid it is going to fall out
"The shirt would have been perfect except it was way too small for my nine-year old. The product measurements on the quiksilver site do not match this garment at all, even though the tags said it was XS and presumably a men's"
Cute but it just didn't have the look and feel of genuine leather. I returned it.
I tried using other insoles but ended up using the original instead. I'm not a big fan of the white sole. I think it limits how you can use this shoe. a brown one would allow you to use it with more clothing..
Love the shoes but they run big. Wish I knew this before buying them. Buy half a size smaller when purchasing these shoes.
it works well I guess but I didn't like the material and its short.
I normally wear a 10 1/2 or 11 but my feet were swimming in the 10.5 I ordered.  I have gotten loads of compliments on them though.
The shirt is cute but I am tired of the material always being the same shiny material.  Seems like everything from China is like that.
"A light jacket is what I wanted and that is what I got.  The material is thin, it's light in weight  but the sleeves are to long.  It probably will not last long, like most things we buy today, but I like it"
"Runs very small and print has already wore off after 1 month of use. Super cool originally and in our wedding pictures but the skull now resembles a batman symbol and compared to my husbands other sing, same size it is quite a bit smaller."
This watch is very nice looking. It has a classy look especially for world travelers. I don't know that I would suggest it men though. It does have a bit of a feminine look.  After having the watch for about 2 weeks the band broke. It just popped right off. I was able to find the pin that fell out and put it back together however the pin is bent now. Then where the band wraps over the pin came apart. I think it just needs to be glued back down and it would be fine. Moral of the story is the watch face is nice but the band is cheap and you should be prepared to change it out or keep having to fix it.
These are so cute and even though I ordered a 1/2 size smaller than I wear they are still to big.  But I can wear them with socks and they're not to bad.
Also runs a little short - toe hits the very end of the shoe - not enough for discomfort but will start ordering an  8 - 1\2.  I  have always ordered size 8's.
Cute shoe but looks cheap and looks like it will wear down fast. I returned.
Fix great at first but stretch out after a few times wearing.
very upset
Somewhat uncomfortable.
"I have been looking for a new pair of riding boots and was super excited with how well these were reviewed I decided to get them.  I found the shaft ended at an odd point on my leg.  Traditional riding boots hit right below the knee, on most people, and these fit a good 8 inches from where all my other boots land.  The taupe I thought was a leather, but it is more of a suede which means stains.  I was very disappointed in how these were described but happy others were able to make them work."
"Somehow I expected more poof.  The material is kinda scratchy in some places (even though there's a slip between you and the tulle) and the top section is shiny and satin-esque.  The satin rides up a little, and bunches a bit, which I don't like very much...but....aside from those nitpicks, the product works well for its intended purchase.  It's a decent length for knee length dresses.  Any longer than knee length though and you might not be able to see the bottom of this petticoat.  It adds some nice volume to the dress I got it for.  If I could go back in time I think id just buck up the extra cash for something a bit better quality.  You get what you pay for!"
"Tight even thou i
Ordered wider with.  Also material is rubbery"
I am on my third xxlarge and each one has been different. I am going to try the xlarge and see what happens....I do like the fabric and shirt very much - I just want one that fits like the first one I bought.
"Toe area is a bit large and extends beyond my toes so it looks like it doesn't fit well. And I wish the heel were higher. The style is cute but too fancy for casual and the heel is not high enough for dressy. Well padded footbed. All in all, just ok."
"Size wise they fit, but the cut is a little short in the leg and long in the body.  They fit more like old man panties, LOL!  It would be better if they were a little more low rise so they didn't show above jeans.  Quality is about what is expected for the price, decent but not a top end apparel item."
"These are super comfy - like socks - but they shred easily. If I could buy a 12 pack for $20 I wouldn't mind, but I only got about 10 wears out of them before they were too shredded - top and bottom - to wear at the pool. If you're wearing them on a smooth surface, they'd likely last longer. Our pool has a very rough finish."
"These shoes are awesome! I gave them 3 stars for only 2 reasons: I particularly don like the strap that goes across the ankle it is too long, and the ridges of the footpad are something you have to get used to. They are just not comfortable for me."
"Much heavier than I would like for a pair of boots for toddlers, but quality is definitely good. But only 3 stars because my son refused to put the left one on after he tried the right one. Probably not for this age group."
I haven't been able to wear them yet because they came too narrow.  Never had this problem with Crocs before.  I read that there is a way to widen them.  I will have to try that before I can use them.
These clogs are huge. I gave them to someone who wears a size nine and has a wide foot and she loves them.
It runs a little on the small side so you can't put it in the dryer
I was disappointed the size ran small and the material was thin.
"Way too small and too short! If I had it pulled all the way up in my hiney, it still wouldn't have covered my boobs. Sent it back, got full refund"
I hope that I can get the bracelet s
These shoes are a good value for the price.
"They're very thin. Functional and stylish, but that's about it. Shipping does take a while, too, but nothing horrible."
"There is no question that Citizen has been trying a little too hard at trying to capture a younger generation of watch owners with their Eco-Drive watches. While they have made some strides, overall they just haven't been worth the money and value in the timepieces that Citizen had been known for. But this year, they are trying to make that up with their latest line of timepieces. This Eco-Drive BRT watch looks good, and handles well, compared some of Citizen's past Eco-Drive models like their dive watches. It has good illumination, and is very easy to tell time. Yet, what I don't like about the watch is that it feels a little too heavy around the wrist, and the orange display doesn't look as good as the green in the watch. It handles well, but more could've been done. I do do suggest you look around and see if you can find more from a Eco-Drive for the money.

Quality of fabric very poor have returned 2 so far - seem like mocks with a real tag.  Norman would not put his name on this type of quality product.
"The lace details are really pretty without being scratchy. The straps are comfortable and spaced nicely so you don't feel like they're going to fall off or choke you. This didn't work for me because it created bulges on the back. I ordered a size too small, but the way the back is cut I think it would have created bulges even in the correct size. If this is a problem area for you, try another style."
"Love the shoes, however the toe box was really narrow. I'm sure it's nothing that can't be adjusted or stretched. I'll try stretching them so that they can fit properly."
Fair pairs.
They are the same size as Carters 2T. Disappointing! But the quality and packaging was really good.
"Acceptable, I suppose, but not nearly as comfortable as the identically-priced (at the time) ""Florsheim Men's Tommy Clog,"" especially in the heel area -- I do not know how slippers are made but there's obviously a difference.  Also, the lining does not hold up at all; it flattens out very quickly."
It's not as fluffy as I wanted
The necklace & chain look pretty but it has a few rough or sharp edges that tend to snag on clothing.
"Seemed like a good idea, but when I actually wore them, they had a tendency to come off when bending or twisting in such a way that one side or the other developed some temporary slack. Straighten up, and like as not, one strap was off.  And the back strap doesn't fit pants that have a wide belt loop in the center of the back.  I should have noticed that before ordering."
short in lenght
They seem to be comfortable but they do run small.
But much thinner material than I was expecting.
this was returned.
"the width is roomier than expected . . . the color great, style adorable (reminds me of my tap shoes . . . and that is great memories)  not as comfortable as i thought they might be . . . wearing socks with them help and look quite cute . . ."
"It looks like a spot of paint is on this scarf. The packaging is lovely, the seams look fantastic but the scarf is stained so I cannot give this as a gift. I am bummed."
"Came sooner than expected. The size is however, a little small.
Is from China. Only b/c of that, I'll not be purchasing from this seller at all.
Very pretty and sparkly."
"I absolutely love this dress and I was able to make it work. However I had to tie the strap that goes across the back to keep the dress up. It worked fine for me since I have long hair and always have it down, I definitely couldn't wear my hair up with it. Otherwise it fit pretty well, I am 5'1 and 120lbs. It was a bit on the short side but not too short for me, but depending on your personal preference it might be short for you."
Cute boot but I couldn't even get my foot through the top part and even bought them 1/2 size bigger than normal
I have wide feet so it fits a bit snug. The ankles are very wide which made me give it a low grade. I prefer my shoes to fit closely at the ankles
the back is loose and the shoe keeps slipping off
Recently receive this watch too soon to write a true review. But i will give three stars on appearance
Way too big with no supporting structure. This bag is perfect probably for storage but not traveling since there is nothing to hold it in. Very solid quality though.
Warm leggings and soft at first. After 2-3 washes  the softness starts wearing off. Recommend using cold water and gentle cycle maybe
"The boot felt great in the foot, the heel was snug and the sole was flexible making it feel nimble to walk on, but the mouth of the boot was just too wide to be comfortable. Overall, it looks superb, but if you're like me and have twigs for ankles this boot probably won't wear very well."
It has a pretty pattern and an extra lining inside. There is a lot of fabric going on here and I just have no idea what or how to wear this. It looked better on the model. Even my daughter who loves all flowy Stevie Nicks-type clothes couldn't figure out what to wear it with.
The toddler size doesn't fit a size 4t. My son couldn't wear it. Good quality and fast delivery.
One of the rompers fit good but the other one was almost to small. They were both the same size.
Nothing special- used them for a costume and they kept bunching up
"While this is a lovely bra, and fits in the cup quite well, the coverage under the arm is lacking.  I was disappointed, as my other Wacoal bra fits very well in that area and is the same size.  The picture also showed better coverage than the bra actually offers.  If you are a large breasted woman, buyer beware!"
The waist is very high
"Seems to be a good shoe for the money, but my son preferred the London Fog brand for comfort and looks."
"Giant. I bought the 6 months, he'll fit in it somewhere between 9-12."
"It comfortable, but look big, should have bought a 9.5"
Nicely made jacket but too tight around forearms.
"Looks just like the picture, Buuuuut it's too small on.  I'm  a little upset.  I'm hoping once I lose weight it will fit better..."
"Product was listed to fit true to size, but fits like a small or even extra small. Good quality shirt though."
These were nice boots and fit easily on me until I had to zip them up.  I have meat on my bones and one I could zip with effort and the other wouldn't even zip past a few inches.  I guess these zip up boots are meant for women with no muscle because I've tried with three different pairs from three different companies and they've all been a no go for me.
The colors are a bit darker than what is seen here so it didn't match what I wanted it to.. but it's still a nice comfortable dress
"I own a Casio G-Shock and needed a replacement band.  This is a ""Casio original equipment"" band but it is about an inch shorter than the factory band my watch came with.  I have large wrist and it will barely fit."
I liked this product a lot. I have very high arches and work 12 hour shifts at work. I am constantly standing or walking around. The only downfall is that I have only had the product for one week and the blue is already rubbing off. I have bought these shoes for the last 10 years and this is the first time this has happened. I'm not sure if the quality is that of what it used to be. But the arch support makes this shoe for me.
I will be returning this item.  Based on reviews I purchased a medium and it is too tight through the chest area.
Much smaller than the tag size. At least 2 sizes smaller
Ordered a 10.5 wide and they were not wide.
"The sandal is comfy and I love that the front strap is 30% elastic coz I have fat/wide feet. However the cutting of the sandals is a little narrow so that when I do wear the sandal, you can see my foot is 'hanging out' just a little.

But I'll still keep it coz it's real comfy and I love the simple design."
bought a bigger size and still a little tight hopefully they will stretch I love Danskos I NEED the arch support I have really flat feet
I thought I ordered this one (grey) but what I received was black all over (I already have black tennies--don't need any more).  I do like the way Coach shoes fit my feet.
wasn't crazy about the color or style
"I am a rock solid size 14M in everything and these are tight in every dimension, literally the first time I have ever had a shoe in this size not at least mostly fit.  If you have a smallish skinny foot these would probably be OK but not even close to true sizing.  They look like they would have been nice though!"
hurts the top of my feet
"They are very soft and has no support at the bottom, ie has no resistant soles. It's the only complaint I can have him."
Incorrect item pictures on website see photo of what was received.  Item received was loved!
"These are bigger than I expected. I even used the size chart provided and I still ordered too large. So if you are in doubt, order a size down.

I bought theses for postpartum reasons and I have been wearing them for a few months now, even though they are loose. Quality is average and they have held together just fine."
"They arrived flat. I was able to round them out a bit but there were a couple of creases that I was unable to get rid of which pulled the shape off.

The elastic is not very tight. I wear size 12(US women) or size 10(US men) and the elastic went under the shoe and up both side about 2 inches. I had to pull the excess elastic in and safety pin it so that it would pull the shoe cover down over/around my shoe. Otherwise the shoe covers just flopped around on top of my shoes (not around my shoes like in the product picture).

I attached a picture of how they looked before my alterations. Sorry I didn't get a picture after my alterations, but they looked better."
The dress looked really cute in the picture. When i put it on it made me look larger than I am. For my figure it wasn't flattering. The quality of fabric was really good though.
"Are beautiful, but too small"
"After only having 2 months, it is starting to ball up and look old.  :(  I would give it more stars if it was holding up better."
Really cute but too small short and small even though I order a bigger size
Very cute but also very tiny
The soles were very nice and the cushion felt great but they were very narrow where the laces start at the top of the shoe. They were still tight even with loosening the laces.
"This is an inexpensive kit and part of it broke the second time I used it.  That said, I paid less for the kit than I would have paid to have it done at the store!

It has many tools but no instructions for any of them so I watched YouTube videos to figure out what to do with what.  I see they sell replacement parts for the ones that break (probably recognition of how cheap their product is made) but buying the replacement parts is more expensive than buying an entire new kit.  Go figure.

Bottom line: I'd definitely buy it again to save the time and money it would take just to have a watch sized.  (The kit is half the price of one watch sizing.)"
I assumed I was getting leather uppers since that's what I've had before - not so.  Description says it varies with color!  Sheesh
"didn't mind the fabric or anything, if you want tight stiff jeans, might as well look elsewhere.  Only thing I didn't really like about these jeans are the button up fly, but guess I should have paid attention when buying.  Oh well, only one pair and I'll probably just wear around the house anyway."
"Fits perfectly. One major issue is that it stretches too easily and becomes annoyingly too long for wear, have to wash and use dryer to get it to shrink back up, I tie the tzitzit in a way so that they are not destroyed by the washer and dryer."
"It is actually one of my favorite headbands, however it is NOT cream.  It is YELLOW.  Buyer beware!"
Nice color great price. Downside no tsa lock and not expandable.
"They are cute, but they are too flat.  No support."
"Very nice shirt, well made and heavy but the sizing is way off. I'm 6'5"" 280lbs and an XXL fits me in almost everything. The XXL in this shirt is way to big in the belly, length and sleeves are perfect but 2 of me could fit in this and button it up no problem."
"I'm happy with the ""look"" and ""style"" of this ring. The only issue I have with the ring is that it is quite large and heavy thereby limiting it to just a few fingers which ""work"" with the fit (size 9). In retrospect I wish I had ordered a smaller version of the same style in the same size (9)."
"The strap over the toes was a little big on me. They were cute otherwise, but I returned them because of the strap."
"Great looking shoe, but way too large. Size a FULL size down, not a half size."
I wear 6.5 and ordered 7.  I should have gotten 6.
"I did not get the right colors when I got this order.  I had actually ordered these bras and another set just like them that were three different colors than these at the same time.  The other colors were dark purple, dark turquoise, and dark pink.  Out of the six bras I got, I received two dark purple bras, two dark turquoise bras, one light pink bra, and one dark pink bra.  I was really disappointed I did not get a light purple bra and a light turquoise bra as I was supposed to have gotten.  But I do like these bras and they are comfortable to work out in at the gym."
Pretty suite but runs very very small. I wear a 4/6 and ended up with an extra large. Fits ok but not quite proportioned right for me being that big. I'll wear it though next spring when I go to the therapy pool.
"Good: they look great
Bad: they are not very dark
Good: you can wear them to meetings OR clubbing!!"
Wish it were sterling! Beautiful
Ended up returning them - sizing was as expected but they were rubbing on the toe and worried they would blister quickly.  Pretty otherwise.
"I've worn this brand forever & I ordered 3 packs of these, 1 pack was the old cut of Hanes but the 2 others are cut differently & the new tag free. The new cut is lower waisted & the butt now slides up more than the old which DIDN'T!! Don't know why Hanes had to change an old cut to a new not as good cut!"
"The soles of these slippers are slick, not like other Dearfoams I've purchased for the last umpteen years.  They are fine on carpet, except on the carpeted stairs, but really slippery on the tile floor in my kitchen.  That's a bit scary for an older woman.  I've walked around outside on the concrete to scuff them up a bit for better traction but no luck with that yet.  Liked the old Dearfoams much better and never felt like I might slip and break a hip.  A word to the wise on this one."
The shoes are very pretty but they fit somewhat small. I had to put them on stretchers and wear them a few times before they fit.
"I got these to wear with a new pair of flats as I hate going sockless. I had never bought these kind of socks before, so I bought a couple different brands. Based on descriptions and reviews, I thought these would be my favorites, but in fact they were my least favorite. They were continuously slipping off my ankle and bunching up under my foot, which drove me crazy.

It may be perhaps that my feet are wider than average. I never buy wide shoes, but in looking at these socks compared to the others, they are much more narrow in the actual foot area. On the plus side, these were virtually invisible under my shoes. If your feet are smaller and more narrow they may well work beautifully. I think these would be worth trying if not showing is your number one criteria. These definitely had the lowest profile of all three brands.

In case you are wondering, I also bought Hue no-show socks. They showed just a tad, but stayed on my foot better. I also bought a pair from Target - Merona brand that stayed on perfectly, but they also came up and covered almost half of the top of my foot and so really couldn't be called no-show socks. :)"
It's $35 and it's not bad. I've seen worse. I'm 5-11 175 and got the XL and am glad. It runs a little small so the XL fit fine. I don't consider myself heavy at all and am glad I ordered big.  Mask smells like rubber out of the package so leave out ASAP to let it air out.
"This cap is absolutely fine, except I gave it 3 stars only because I was looking for something with a bill longer than the standard 3 inches. The picture gave me the impression that the bill was longer, but it turned out to be just a standard length. Otherwise it's a nice lightweight cap, and the colors are great."
Felt small for the size I ordered.. Band kept rolling up.
nice shirt..it fits little bigger than i expected but it still fits  well none the less  and i like it...
"The pants themselves are wonderful!!  Great, cool fabric!
Shamefully, however, i had to return them due to poor description of the product.
I wanted pants for my 5 year old.  I went by the size chart.  However the title of this product says BIG GIRLS'  --- key --- make sure you look at the Big Girls size chart to get the right size.

These pants are not for little 5 year olds! :(  My 5 year old put on the Large 5-6 and they literally went up to her head and just baggy baggy all over!!  Could have fit me as a capri!

Sad!"
I didn't realize how big it is...to big but ok.
"Ok for the price but they came with 2 entirely different size shoe laces, one of which is barely long enough to tie the shoe!  Had to take it down 2 holes to be able to tie it,"
"Was very prepared to leave 5 stars until the second washing and one of them basically separated at the ""cuff"".  A bigger hole was created than in the socks I FINALLY replaced with these.  I'm going to go with......it got caught on something in the dryer, but..........I dunno.  I will say that the other ones fit better than any sock I've worn in the past.  They stay up OVER the calf and you don't even know it.  They don't leave marks so the way the fabric is made is just right.  Gold Toe is a really good brand name with a long history, and these aren't cheap, so I'm not going to say 1 star because of a POSSIBLE issue caused by me.  They fit perfectly, and that's rare for me with socks, in fact, unusually rare.  I'll buy them again."
"Good price, but boots were too small and had to return. Cost to return was more than half the cost of the boots."
the 8.5 fit is a little short
They seemed to be built okay just didn't like the way if fitted my face.  Im more of an aviator type of wearer.
"Beautiful shoe! Fit was good, but I ended up giving them to my granddaughter because the heel was too tall to be comfortable on me."
"The best of Blowfish, but still not great. The soles are sticky and catch on carpet. The bottoms are slick and slide on hardwood and tile.  CAUTION."
Not Happy
"Nice an shining, gf likes them but the balls an cross also feel kinda cheap an could snap if not done right"
"Cup size was great, but 38 fits like a 36"
"The fabric is ok.  I don't think that i'd purchase again... they are not as good as I'd expected.  I'm 5'10"" and they are quite short for me.  I wish that i had better things to say about these.  I think they should be more in the 6.99 price range."
"Great shoes, honestly. Too bad I had to return them because size 5.5 was too small... Wanted to swap for the 6 but they didn't have it..."
"Its alright, not very sturdy, some thicker material would make everything feel more secure."
I ordered really large and yet this one is built for a small frame with a short torso.
My daughter needed this for a school project.  She had to portray Annie Oakley.  The costume definitely runs small.  My daughter is a child size 12 and the belt did not fit her at all.  The vest and skirt were also small and barely fit.  It worked for what we needed but we were hoping it would work for Halloween too in a five months but that is not going to happen.  She did look adorable in it and the construction was satisfactory.  The hat is pretty wimpy but ti works.  It really is not a quality item.  I would not order this again should the need arise.  If you are looking for one time use it probably will work but keep in mind it runs small.  I would say it is at least a full size smaller than actually stated.
A bit too shiny. Desired more of a camel tone however it is a rather peachy-nude tone. Good quality. Comfortable footbed.
"Really small, order 2 sizes up!"
Too small - the XL is approximately a size 12-14 and the fabric is thin. I'd overlook the fabric if the sizing was better.
Runs small. I'm a 10-12 and it just barely fit. It's not super flattering IMHO but it fits okay
They are just okay. A little bit large and awkward compared to another brand I use..
"The material seems like it would hold up well and it's plenty large enough for my foot. Unfortunately, the elastic at the top digs in to my calf and leaves a a crease in my skin. After a few hours wear it becomes painful."
"Let's start with the ingredients.  I see one review here that raves about 100% natural ingredients that he/she can feel immediately when it hits the scalp. That is not true.... far from it, in fact.  Granted, the manufacturer makes no such claim, so I don't know where this reviewer comes up with this; I assume he can read since he was able to write a review.  Ingredients are listed in order of highest content to least.  Ingredient #1 is water-it almost always is.  After that, there are 8 compounds listed that would require and advanced degree in chemistry to read, much less understand.  Then we get to the Peppermint, more chems, shea butter and such.  Not a big deal.. just clarifying.  The shampoo/conditioner is good.  It doesn't lather as much as I'm used to, which is to be expected with a combo product, especially one sans the sulfates.  It has a pleasing, not overbearing scent and I do feel a slight tingle on my scalp after massaging it in, probably due to the peppermint.  It leaves my hair shiny as advertised; my hair is relatively short so tangles are never an issue.  It doesn't take much product to clean my hair, a couple of pumps is sufficient.  I do like this quite a bit, but it is very expensive.  I use Jack Black products religiously-shampoos, shaving products, lotions, etc... and I've never been disappointed with their performance.  I'll probably stick with their regular shampoo after this bottle is exhausted, mostly because of the price point.  If money is no object, I'll say go for it.  If you are price conscious, there are alternatives available for less than half of what you'll pay for this."
"Ended up returning this bra. It's very closed on top, which doesn't work well with my shape. It would be better for someone who is full on bottom, rather than even or full on top."
"Very pretty, but not comfortable. I knew I would not be able to wear them very long."
I think the boots are adorable but they are a little small. I am a very tall girl and ordered a 13. I just wish they were a little roomier in the toes.
"Did a lot of reading up on raw denim and these shrink-to-fit jeans. I bought my actual size instead of sizing up. I soaked these in hot water, let them hang dry, then I wore them while still damp. The idea is these jeans would shrink to fit everyone's unique contours.

I've seen mixed messages on washing these subsequent to the initial hot bath, but I figured they have to get washed eventually. After washing in delicate cycle and hang drying, the waist shrank significantly more than length.

The end result is these fit very snugly around the waist. The length is about as expected now (initially was long). I'd say I have fairly large calves, but the legs still seem a bit billowy. The fabric feels very dense compared to other Levi's. They look nice, and I'm starting to see some crease patterns, which I think is desirable on raw denim. I bought these about 5 months ago and waited this long - so considering the effort, I think a regular pair of 514's is probably preferable."
"Due to my ability as a seamster (tailor), I altered and shortened the crotch and moved up the back panel. I am disappointed in the Fruit of the Loom company making a union suit with such a low-hanging crotch (inseam)!  The suit's total length, fabric, seams, buttons/button holes/, and cuffs are well made.

No one needs that much void!

Is there a Fruit of the Loom research and development committee--test subjects--and quality control?

The image on AMAZON shows a model wearing well tailored union suit."
The necklace is beautiful and sturdy. The earrings that came with it were gold toned and did not match the necklace. Fail.
The item arrived as described.  However the box was destroyed and the packing was a mess.  All the supporting papers and cartons that were supposed to be inside the boots were all out and it was obvious that they were returned items.  I did not want to bother with returning or exchanging so I am keeping them. I was surprised a bit as Amazon's vendors are usually very good at these sort of things.
"Made of light, soft cotton, The letters have an unusual smell to them. Ordered as Prime, but didn't get it in two days from ordering.
The neck opening must be stretched before dressing a baby as there are no buttons or snaps that can be unbuttoned to widen the opening."
"I have worn this shoe before and had to purchase a 1/2 size up. Also, the sole seems to be peeling away from the bottom and they have only been worn for a very short duration (~2months, not in water)."
It was too small for my granddaughter. I had to give it to one of my nieces.
Ordered these in my daughters correct size and she couldn't even slide her foot in because they were so narrow. Had to return them.
The straps keep falling and the back closure is not adequate for a large sized woman. I'll wear it but it is not a favorite.
Too large; need to return both jeans for a regular rather than a husky. Can't find my invoice receipts. Can you help me with this return?
"Great looking shoes, perfect heel height and style but they very wide in the middle and heel area. Have to return since that model not coming in narrow width"
"The style is cute but the blazer runs large. I am 5'4"" 108lbs and I was completely lost in the small....way too baggy."
You will need an xl head-
Nothing spectacular.  Decent for the price.
"I was so excited to get this bag. It had everything I was looking for in a crossbody - not too big, not too small, adjustable strap, lots of pockets, leather. The dealbreaker was the horrible metallic odor the hardware gave off. Imagine if you held a bunch of dirty pennies in your hand all day long and let them get all good and sweaty? Yup, that's what this bag smells like. Total bummer. :("
"I was super excited when this arrived ! It's a beautiful color and looks exactly like the picture. I did order the petticoat to give it a little extra flare which really helped but you don't need it. It's a very flowy dress, and not bulky in any way. I'm smaller in stature so when I tied it up the bust fell a little higher than my actual bust line. But that's nothing a good bra can't fix. I'd deff recommend this dress. It's beautiful."
I like it. It fits okay but it's not exactly the style I was expecting.
Cold fingers
"These are cute socks, and look like what was pictured, although I got a couple of repeat designs instead of 12 individual designs, as shown.  That's not really a big deal, to me, though.  My main disappointment is that these are NOT baby socks, even though it specifically says ""baby"" and ""newborn"" in the title.  And that's who I bought them for: my 5 month old son.  These won't fit him for awhile.  They're even too big for my 2 year old, who has really big feet. These are more along the lines of small kid socks.  Or big toddlers.  Maybe 3 years and up."
"somewhat short in the stride, but the color was good and for the money was a good deal"
This costume was adorable i just wish the quality was a little better around the legs of the costume.
"My son wanted a shark tooth necklace.  Unfortunately the shark tooth on this is small and not impressive.  The tip of the tooth has a chip which makes it shorter than it should have been.  The rest of the necklace is fine but since I bought it for the shark tooth, I feel disappointed."
"I have narrow low-volume feet, so typical flip-flops don't stay secure for even relatively normal walking.  The Decimal gets around this with a contoured footbed and four, rather than one, toe posts.  Very comfortable (yes, the four toe posts are still comfortable) and very secure, yet still in a slip-on.

The Decimal is the flip-flop variant of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sazzi-Digit-Outdoor-Hiking-Sport-Sandal/dp/B00CWWGLIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sazzi Digit Outdoor Hiking Sport Sandal</a>, which I also own and wear.  Because the Digit runs so large, I ordered down a full size on the Decimal.  Which was the correct choice.  Although in doing so, the Decimal is pretty tight on the strap.  Time will tell if it loosens up.  Despite going down a full size from my normal shoe size, while the main footbed fits well, the toe portions (which are shaped, just as with the Digit) do stick out much further than my toes.  In my clutzy case, the toe protection is probably good for protection.

Pros: They dry really quickly, the toe posts are not at all annoying and they are very secure.
Cons: Odd sizing/shape, arch support is too aggressive (feels like a hard ball under my arch) and they take a bit more focus to slip on than single-toe-post flips.  (Still slip-on, but sometimes I have to look to line up the toes with the posts.)

So far these are my favorite flip-flops.
=====================================
Edit: Three months later, that over-aggressive arch support in the ball of the foot is still quite annoying.  I knocked a star off for that."
Tight fit for my glasses.
comfy but not great...too short or too long..I must be in-between
Even though they say wide their still a little tight.
"My grand kids paid me a visit before school, so had to purchase this item for the youngest one to have a watch like the older two starting back to school. I hope it lasted him the drive time getting back home, it was already running when I opened the package, for how long only the seller knows?"
"Had enough slots and spots for everything, but once it's fully loaded it was bursting at the seems. It was not made to have every spot filled. Just wasn't wide enough or not enough give for all the spaces to have something in it. And the checkbook recording pad wouldn't fit in the space provided for it. I had to fold the pages b/c the space was too short."
"I ordered these in both the curry and the tobacco colors b/c wasn't sure which I'd prefer. I am always a size 5 and ordered these both in a 5. The curry color was at least 1/2 size too small, but the tobacco fit perfectly. Sadly, I preferred the curry, so they will both go back and I'll try for a 5.5. The other issue was that the shaft of the boot felt rigid, almost as though it forced me to lean forward a bit. I like the look of the shoe enough that I'll risk it and hope they soften with wear. Seems rather pathetic that Sorel can't churn out the same size sizes of the same shoe in different colors."
"These were MUCH lighter in color than pictured (I got Silver Grey).  I was looking for a dark grey, these are closer to white. Quality and size is good though."
Needs to be about an inch wider to hold a tube of libstick n medicine case
"I bought 2 packs of size 7-8 in October 2012 for my son who wears size 10. Although the quality was superb (thick and soft), they were a tad big for him at that time. After 4 months of wash & wear, they stretch a little & bunch up whenever he wears his boots, so I decided to order 2 more packs. This time I ordered size 6-7. I kept the package from my previous purchase (7-8) and a pair of the socks unused for comparison. Guess what? Size 6-7 is exactly the same size as size 7-8. I also noticed that the socks from my 1st purchase were a lot thicker. So I checked the package & it turns out that the socks from my 1st purchase (7-8) were made in Korea whereas the socks from my 2nd purchase (way thinner) were made in China. I wish they kept being made in Korea :("
I like the skirt. It's much longer than I thought and it fit me pretty loose. I would order one size smaller. I wear the skirt high on my waist and just tuck in my shirt and it's fine.
"For my husband, wedgies! Much prefer Docker's Performance, but I was hoping these would be acceptable.  Wanted to have a variety of colors because of laundry days-having dark and light colors, guaranteeing clean undies all the time."
They turn your finger green very quickly but are beautiful.
"So I am a 'medium' sized person, so I think, but this bra is pretty small and I've got a little bit of boob overflow going on.  The back is cool and I guess it will work for wearing under tank tops but I wish that it fit better."
Has three pockets. Fits a lot of stuff. Got lots of compliments. Bought it for a 90's themed bar crawl.
"Its just okay. I bought it for myself but gave it to a young teenager.  Its not quite what I wanted, but it was inexpensive so..."
It's just OK. Skechers run narrow for me and the shape of the toe area is not wide enough. I have a regular size foot. I had to get a 1/2 size larger.
"I got these leggings yesterday and put them in today. They fit great. I am a size 2 (USA) in jeans and I got the small size in the leggings. I love the feel of these, so soft but not hot at all. I only give 3 stars because they already are pulling a bit :( see in photo. But for the price there nice."
"Very, very uncomfortable shows with absolutely no shock absorption or padding, but cute for the price.  Had to bring backup shoes because these are not shoes you want to be standing all night in.  They are also a bit cheap, but, again, served the purpose for a one night shoe."
"Cute, but not comfortable. Can't wear them all day without my pinky hurting. Shame!"
Too shear for my liking. Sending back.
"I bought the small size for my tall 3 year old, which they are slightly big on her. The material is a good quality, however the boot strap buckles are awfully cheap and have broken after just a few uses.

Some suggestions to Lucky Bums for future versions.
*better buckles and/or elastic rubber boot straps
*a double row of velcro so the gaiters can ""grow-with-me"" allowing parents to get a better fit on children who are in between sizes
*kid friendly color options"
- My son likes this article though the material is not anything of another world.
"I looked long and hard for the right black flat for a decent price and I picked the Rockport Motion Ballet Flat. I'm disappointed that after the first time I wore them, the polish was rubbed off and scuffed on the toe. I have to polish the darned shoes every time I wear them. In addition, the heel support is flimsy and appears crushed with wear. So, would I purchase these shoes again, no. Keep looking."
"It's way more pink than it a pictured, I bought if for my fiance to wear for a friends wedding we're going to and I wanted his tie to match my dress. The pictured tie matched perfect but it is a few shades more pink in real life. It'll get the job done for what I need it to and the price isn't bad at all for the quality of tie you get. Just wish it was actually colored as shown."
"I saw a similar pair at DSW, but they didn't have my size (5).  I had high hopes for this pair from Amazon.  I liked these riding boots.  The dark brown color was exactly what I wanted.  The zipper of the boot does not go all the way to the top, but instead starts a few inches after the top part of the boot. This is not a problem since the width of the boot  easily allows you to slip your feet/leg into boot.  Unfortunately the zipper on one of the boot got stuck and could not be unzipped all the way.  There was only one size five left, so I'm unable to order another one.  I'll just have to keep on looking."
"my 4 year old's head is large so this was the best fit without going to older kids sizes, which i feared would be too big. but to achieve the packability the bill has to be flexible - and as such is too shapeless. it falls too over my son's face which results in him running around with his head tilted back so he can see under it. i've tried forming it to give it shape but to no avail."
"These gloves are a pretty color, have a nice satin feel and are very shimmery but... they are way too small. I bought the size indicated for Girls Age 7-14 for my daughter who is 8 but the fingers were too short and the ""wrist length"" gloves stopped just above the wrist.  I wouldn't recommend these gloves for a formal occasion but for playing dress up, they're ok."
I always wear a womans 9 in Nikes but these are bigger than usual. The right one almost slips off my foot a bit.  They are really light and not as sturdy as what I was looking for but over all not bad.
"love the style, the fabric is cheap and it runs big"
good deal but tight fit.
A decent dress for the price.  The fit was a little tight and I've had a little bit of shrinkage in the wash.  It's VERY short and would be indecent without leggings (I'm 5'8).
"Quality is decent especially for the price.

They run 2 sizes too small.

Toe strap is much too thick for child's comfort.

Box arrived crushed inside Amazon box."
I expected it to look a little more authentic after reading the reviews. It's ok and pretty but looks too fake. I think I can find a nicer one for the same price. I don't think I'll buy jewelry through amazon again as I have been dissapointed before
Nice soft material but headband was way too thick for my 12 year old.  Description should be re-written with measurements included.  Had to return it.
"It's priced well and, I think, worth the price but it's not a show stopper or anything to ""fall in love"" with. It looks just like the pictures and the outside is well (enough) crafted. The card slots are fine, I guess the cards get stuck but it's not a deal breaker.
However, the back section, where the money and coins are held, is not well made at all. There's really cheap fabric that could probably easily tear with the wrong force on it. If it were any more expensive than it is that would probably be enough to cause me to return it but since it's just $10, I would say it's worth keeping. I didn't really like the saying on it because it hardly makes sense and is really cheesy but it's small enough that you can hardly read it...which is a good or bad thing depending on how much you like the saying.
Ultimately, I think it's a good buy, if you're not concerned about high quality (at this price, that shouldn't be your top priority ha). If you like the colors and the design, it's exactly like the pictures and you will probably like it."
Great fitting shirt. The metal rivets came off however after the first wash. Still looks okay though.
"This shoe is very cute.  However, it is to wide for my foot."
"I have had a pair of these for 5 months now.  They have held up well.  I generally wear them about twice a week.  They are stylish boots.  I feel that the general level of quality and workmanship in the boot doesn't quite measure up to the cost of $150.  I have many pairs of Chippewa boots and I find that for similar price points they offer a better made mid height boot.  Admittedly the Chippewas might not be as stylish as these boots, so that could account for some level of the price premium, but I just don't feel that these boots convey the level of quality to match the price.  I feel that a better price point for these is around the $80 range."
I have this purse in gold and love it. The royal blue however is NOT royal blue. The purse is ok but the blue is not as pictured.
"It's ok. Kind of cheap looking. Certainly can't wear it for warmth, but does the job of covering the party dress!"
"Decent bra for it's price. Only complaint is there isn't much stretch and i definitely reccoment sizing UP! I ordered my normal size (bout post-baby) and it was way smaller than i liked, but it gets worn when laundry is running low!"
this pants are very cute and just what I ordered. the quality of the fabric is very cheap. but worth it to me. :)
"I am 5'4"" and 114 lbs.  Usually I wear a size 4 in pants.  I ordered these in a size Small and they fit fine except that they are SUPER long.  Nice material.  The blue ""tie dye"" pattern/color is as pictured.  Once I get them shortened I think they'll be fine for beach pants, which is the purpose for which I ordered them."
Not really a XX. Returned.
"i have searched and searched...need help. How do I fine the top that goes under the jumper...i having been looking for two days NO luck.  Need your help.  I have bought lots-lots of Mud Pie outifits, but never have I had this hard of time to complete an outfit.  Size needed 6 to 9 months baby girl. Where do I fine the bodysuit or top size 6 to 9 months baby girl...Thank YOU so much..."
The around the neck was too big the reg of the dress was perfect
"Came a little smaller than expected. Color for these is lighter than advertised. Overall though, a good look and good for work and casual wear"
Quality isn't very good...soul started separating after 2 months.
"This ring is huge, not only in the size of the stones, but also in the height of the ring. It is really flashy"
"My last purchases were from another manufacturer and although those boots were comfortable and easy to put on/off by using the side zippers, they did not last as long as they should have.  Either poor stitching or not enough material seemed to be the cause.  This time I decided to spend 1/3 more for these boots.  They, as advertised, are very comfortable right out of the box.  So were the former boots.  These are waterproof, the others were not but that was not a big issue.  What I find interesting is that although I have worn these only 7 full days, only today was I able to pull them off using only the side zippers.  Maybe it will get easier but up to now I have had to unlace them.  I note that under the zipper is a flap that runs the entire length of the zipper.  Perhaps this makes them waterproof but sure hard to put on and take off without unlacing them.  Hopefully this problem will improve.  The former boots did not have the flap under the zipper and that enabled the boots to easily be slipped on.  The 5.11's can only be opened about 2 inches."
It was far too large had to return it. But looked like a nice boot if it fit.
It served it's purpose for the 3 week time period my real engagement ring was being sized.
"I didn't realize from the web page that these were satin.  The zippers were hard to work, but otherwise the shoes looked like what one could expect for the low price.  I didn't like the finish and would have returned them for that reason except the size 9 I ordered (and which generally always fits) was about a half inch longer than my foot.  It looked like a size 10 sandal would fit me.  I would order a half or full size smaller than I wear should I choose to reorder."
Stones keep falling out
These leggings rip easily at the seams.  My daughter is skinny and never had a problem with pushing the limits of seams.  So I was surprised to see numerous holes forming at the seams down the legs and in between the upper legs.  They are warm and great selection of colors for the price.  I just wish they were better made.
"I didn't know how skinny ""Skinny"" was."
button holes too small or buttons too lge  wrinkle very easily also rec folded which made large fold creases
"Very cute and soft. The strap is delicate but stable. I only wish it were a bit longer. The lower level of fringe is fringe only, not purse. So although I checked the measurements, a kid-sized wallet does not fit properly. The bag is unable to be closed with a wallet inside. It is perfect as a change purse or for fashion, but it shouldn't be used for large amounts of change that may fall out."
"looks great, and great price"
"Sent me wrong size, a little too heavy weight for me."
Not what I was looking for. Coral color is better compared too a neon orange.  Material is soft but very thin.
"It's comfortable, but about 3 inches shorter than I expected."
Cute top but was a little tight for my comfort.  I wear between a 1x and 2x normally.  The last item I ordered was a 2x and was too big so I went with a 1x this time and it was not flattering in the back.
"I love the comfort and feel of these boots. I bought them because I'm on my feet most of the day working the homestead. We've got a fair amount of land, wooded area, a workshop and a garden that all need tending. I was looking for something lightweight, sturdy and waterproof. I got two out of three. The Mantra 2.0 Gore-Tex is advertised as being waterproof, but they don't even keep out the morning dew. Very disappointed on that account."
This is obviously a kids hat.  Wish that was in the description when I bought it.  Does not fit a large or x-large head.
"I bought the tortoise shell non mirrored lens version. These are pretty sunglasses that do the job they are meant for. They look just as shown in the image and I have received many compliments so far. However, they feel very cheap, meaning they are a light weight plastic that feels as if they will fall apart the first time I drop them. When I got them they were so loose I had to slightly bend them at the nose bridge to make them stay on my head. I do love that I can push them onto my head without the nose guards/rests (not sure what you call them) getting tangled in my hair since they are flat and a part of the frames. The shipping was fast and on time as promised by the seller."
Order a size larger than what you normally wear for comfort.
"Not size 13, small and tight"
"Let me state that Capezio Ultra Soft tights are made of excellent quality & are the only  brand we purchase. The 3 stars given are due to labeling & not being aware of the waist band which is very important to the dancer.

A pair of Ultra Soft Capezio tights were needed . However these had a waist band that is elastic  & it rolls. Style 1816 KA14 they were not what was expected being a Ultra Soft Capezio tights.
In comparation to the preferred style 1618 HA16  of Ultra Soft Capezio tights, which has the waist band made of the same material as the tights themselves.
This is the 2nd pair of Ultra Soft purchased from Amazon on behalf of Capezio & both had the same waist issues one being this & the other being suntan transitional
You can see by the photos what I'm referring to."
"Waist was good, but pant legs way too long for 32 length. Also took forever to ship (like a month)."
Run super wide...
"Wanted to love.  Size and color accurate.  However, the toe box is so large it is very close to the strap and cut into the top of my foot = not for someone (me) with high arches.  Otherwise comfortable, but back they go because the top hurts!!"
"Love the color, but the style is ""eh"". I needed a rosish-silver shoe, though."
"Absolutely gorgeous pattern and color. I only wish the canvas was coated so it wouldn't get dirty as quickly. Also, is it just me or has nine west's sizing become unreliable all of a sudden?"
"This product is not a very strong of a binder. I wanted something with more strength. Also, states that you can order a S, M, or L, but there it's no where to input this much needed information, therefore the item that I received was too large."
"Shoes fit somewhat small, i would choose a half size bigger. Love the style but i would get a half a size bigger for comfort!!!"
"I like the coat a lot, its nice and comfy. Perfect for walking in between classes and really cold days. Although, I would say the quality is not worth $82. The very first time wearing it, the pocket stitching was coming undone and the zipper stitching as well. I had to take the time to sew a brand new coat. Also, the coat's pockets are pretty small (even for someone like me with small hands). Lastly, (probably the most annoying detail) is that this coat picks up EVERYTHING. Lint, hair, fuzzies and even bits of paper will find its way to cling to the coat's material. So if you have pets I do not suggest purchasing. Coat's usage/purpose 9/10, but aesthetics/quality is 4/10."
"These earrings look much more expensive than they actually are. Very sparkly, and the gold-plating makes them look like solid gold. But, like other reviewers, I thought they were a bit small. I would not recommend them if your earlobes are the least bit chubby, like mine.  Sometimes I had difficulty getting them through my ears to fasten them.  And I do not like the clasp style at all.  I could never tell if they were completely fastened or not, and sure enough, one of the clasps let loose today, the earring came out of my ear somewhere, and is long gone.  Next time I will order larger hoops with a different clasp."
"Not the best quality, but functional."
"Sized right, but narrow! I also did not realize they were bedazzzled. They are okay, i will keep and wear them."
Even the wide is very narrow and not tall. They squeezed the tops of my sons feet. Nice looking shoes but we had to return them.
"The shirt's size runs quite small. I ordered a Medium, which is usually oversized on me. The Medium shirt was the size of a normal Small, and shorter in length. I recommend ordering a size up. Shirt is not as soft of a material as I had hoped it would be. But, nice color and funny message."
Gorgeous dress but I didn't like the way it looked on me.
I wanted to love these shoes because I love everything crocs but they rub on the heel when worn for too long.
Nice but much smaller than expected.  It would be much nicer if it had a little more weight to it.
"Really cute outfit but as I said in my previous review of this brand it, especially the shorts, but both pieces, runs really large.  It runs big in all ways but the waist on the shorts are ridiculously wide, it not only falls off my 5 year old (who I bought it for) and my 7 year old but the shorts are also way too big for my 10 1/2 year old."
It's very comfortable to walk around but not sleep because of the seam in the collar area.  The seam is a bit rough.
Nice but to soft in the heel. it keeps on bending inward
"After a few washings, I'm finding that these sometimes slip down the back of my foot if I'm not in a well-laced tennis shoe."
"I am usually a medium shirt size, but I ordered a small here and it is huge on me, can't decide to either get it tailored or return it at this point"
This would have been a nice shoe but returned them due to too short/too narrow and I had ordered the size I always order.
They are very thin material. I was hoping for something thicker. I wore wool knee highs underneath them to stay warm.
the color shown is not right but I still like it. I expected a more emerald color and got moss/forest greem.
Great shoe love them so far
"Love these boots for grocery shopping & running around town. My feet are always cold & I wanted something that would warm them up & not be so bulky! This is it. These fit under my pants so it looks like I'm wearing a tennis shoe. They are super comfy. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger to fit a thick sock. I love these! I would recommend to a friend! These remind me of hiking boots but warmer & they are really light weight.
I have different boots for snowmobiling & longer periods of time being in the snow."
Much better quality than most of the reviews let on.  My husband loves it!
It's what I expected although the chain links are a little smaller than hoped. All in all the shipping speed was fast and I'm satisfied.
I wore this to my husbands work Gala and it fit perfectly. I received a lot of compliments and my best friend even wore it to her work Gala because it worked out so well for me. I ended up ordering a tulle skirt to go under the dress to help with the flare but it didn't even really need that.
Love the fit and style. Great shoe!
I had gotten this shoe in black and beige...and they seemed to fit better..? I don't know why these seem to fit smaller.
"I bought it for my mom, and she love it! The only thing is that there were many sewing thread, so we had to cut it, because the people would see it. Sizing and color: excellent!"
Love all things Smartwool!  Very comfortable and excellent for running!
love it ill buy another two or three later
Marched closely with reviews. Thick sturdy material with a look akin to thermal underwear. The black color defers this significantly. The forearms are a little tight and I ordered it one size bigger than I usually order things. Fit decently well and looks nice enough. The material isn't super soft but isn't scratchy it isn't uncomfortable on my arms.
I only use these in the shower at the Gym so if you are purchasing for daily wear I would pass.  They are light weight and do the job!
nice desing and quality
"Fits perfectly. I love the material. Great buy, I get alot of looks"
I love these boots. I live in FL so it doesn't get that cold but I love the look of them.
"Absolutely love this little wallet, and so does my boyfriend. Plenty of room for the essentials, well-made and low profile."
"Tissot watches are a great entry into the world of swiss watches, just be aware that most tissot quartz watches use eta disposable movements that are not repairable, although they are regarded as dependable ""work horses""."
I stand all day at work and Keen sandals are the beat foot wear ever!
"I'm pleased with these MIA boots, especially since I got them as a Deal of the Day.  They are comfortable out of the box, and have very cute styling details.  My only minor quibble might not be the boot's fault.  Somehow, the right boot slides further down my leg as I walk than the left one.  That could be the boot, could be my leg.  Regardless, they are easy to wear and have gotten me many compliments."
I love Timberland Shoes! They are very comfortable and beautiful!
Great color for our family photo. Baby looked great
"This is a quality ""man bag"" at a reasonable price. Be aware that it will hold no bigger than a 7 inch tablet. It is a tight fit if you put the tablet in a case but it can be done. Still an extra inch would have been appreciated. I have not tried it with a 6 inch smart phone but believe it would be a good fit for those. It holds my tablet, wallet, ear buds, and a few odds and ends. It is not for much more than that but I wanted something fairly small."
Very comfortable shoes and look great!
Great fit and soft material and the color goes well with many things I have. The color is not as dark as I expected and that is good. It is a soft dark gray not harsh as the word Heavy metal may imply.
"I ordered these to walk my Dog! Wanted a pair of easy slip on shoes for winter/wet wear to walk my dog down the street! I find them waterproof, comfortable, easy on/off, just what I wanted!"
"A+  Great suit.  It fit my wife like a glove and she looked amazing.  It's a small suit due to the strings, but it still covers more than might be expected due to the design."
Great undershirts! Very comfortable!
"Shirt is just fine.  I like it, soft to the touch. I'm 5'9 about 147lb and the small is the correct size for my frame."
"Got it for my wife, who is a huge Doctor Who fan. I easily removed the Union Jack flag pendant, and it looks great. She loved it"
I loved this costume. Sexy but not trashy. So beautiful and fit great.
"This is the first Forge product I have bought and I must say, they are well made.  The lock is easy to set and open and I like the fact that there is an indicator to show when my luggage has been opened by TSA.  I would recommend this product."
This is a pretty cool looking t shirt for one of the best Dr. Who episodes.
"Got my usual size. I'm 5'3"" runs a little short for me in the crotch area."
These Skechers Women's Rumblers-Beautiful People Flip... are great ..my second pair!
"These were a gift for my dad, and he loves them."
Shipping took a little long but my son love's them and fit well.
Suits it's purpose
"I bought this Pea coat for the upcoming Winter since its expected to be very cold. Luckily is came in just in time for the 30 degree weather to get here. I love how durable this jacket is, and although you cant remove the Bib, it is a great feature for keeping your neck warm. Just in case your worried about size I am 6'0 240 lbs and I ordered a XL and it fits great. I have large Biceps and triceps and this still allows me a little room to grow."
"This may be the best pair of jeans I've ever had. The fit is better than expected (slightly looser than previous 501s) and the fabric is a medium-weight denim, but still close to khaki color, so you might be able to get away with wearing them to work!"
Love these shoes! They are ridiculously cute and super comfortable. I broke them in at kickboxing today and they were great. Highly recommend this product.
I bought a size 16 for my tall and skinny 13 year old son for Christmas.  He really likes them and they are super soft.
the best shoes ever
"I received this product on time as expected.  It came in a box and wrapped in a nylon bag, see attached picture.  You would need to open and straighten  out the hat to make it look nice since the hat was all fold up in the plastic bag.  It is made of good quality and I would say it covers your whole face pretty well; you definitely need this hat if you go out in the sun (such as beach or working in your backyard).  The only slight concern that I have was the hat has a metal thing that popped out on the surrounding of the hat, see attached picture.  I had to carefully put it back in since I do not want anyone to accidentally cut herself with it. I would say this is a good hat for the beach or for your back yard, not for going to a party, but that is only my opinion.

Disclosure: I got this hat at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion and I hope I had done that."
"Seemed to fit true to size.  My wife wears smalls from other name brand stores, and the small of this item fit perfectly; form fitting but not uncomfortable.  Very alluring."
"All around good quality, comfortable shoe."
one of my favorite pairs of earring.  nice without being too flashy. well-worth the price.
"I absolutely love this shirt! For reference I'm 5'6"" 138lbs & the XXL fits perfect!"
My work involves standing for proloned hours and I always had problem with my feet. These shoes have solved my problem and I am extremy satisfied with them. I will buy definitly buy it again.
"Seller was great maid my day,carhartt jacket was new with tags and shipped very fast and fit very well no problem at all. Buying a few more from this seller no doubt about it..."
These are greatt so far. My first day breaking them in on a 12 hour shift probably wasn't the greatest but my feet actually weren't that sore. And the next couple work days I did full shifts they supoorted nicely. I will say the toes are great and sturdy working with heavy pallets on jack and in the backroom. I gave it one less star because the nonslip isn't as great as I wish. On wet tile it isn't bad and I have no problems but wet metal or in my freezer or truck trailers where there may be a little ice and water they slip a bit but not bad. Nothing like my regular tennisshoes did. So far they're holding great I'll probably replace rhe laces they're thin and kind-of cheap. Great priced shoe well worth it thus far.
Very comfortable. Not too warm.
Uncut them and wear them like knee highs. They don't come off!!
"when i bought these i bought 2 pairs of this kind of slipper and i have found i wear the other ones a bit more, mostly cause these are VERY warm (andi cut and tied the ""lace"" a bit too tight) tho now that winter is really here... ??? (maybe not!) i find i am drawn to these more... i LOVE the color and i LOVE the slipper and i love the warmth, i bought my husband a pair and i think he has already worm them out, he actually won't take them off... so i would say GREAT PRODUCT!"
My Frozen addict loves it. So far she hasn't broken it though I'm afraid the quality may not be that sturdy.
Shoes fit great.  Came in on time.
These are warm and adorable!
Soft and comfy flat waistband
What can you say?  Alex and Ani....you know you can't go wrong.
Perfect and the color is exactly how it looks online.
These are beautiful. I get so many compliments when I wear them. And the price was unbeatable.
"My husband is very happy with these winter gloves. While they're faux-leather, they look like the real thing, and the knit wrist detail makes them especially cozy, as does the thermal lining. The ""smart touch"" tips allow him to use his smart phone while wearing the gloves. A good value for the money, plus, they are washable in cold water."
"I bought these for my 11 year old football /basketball rough and tumble kid.  I bought them in all three colors because I am so impressed with the fit, the resistance to stain, and the adjustable waistband.  Also, the double knee reinforcement is awesome.  My son used to come home with holes in the knees of his pants just about every other week, but no more.  This are an excellent value and I will continue to purchase them as long as they make his size."
"This is my favorite shirt. It's got a lot of stretch, so it's not exactly loose, but it's a non-clingy fabric. Also - line dry - do not put in the dryer."
Excellence Product
"comfortable, planning to wear it in my upcoming beach trip"
"These feel like slippers more than gym shoes- super flexible and cushy. I put some super feet insoles in and they feel more stable to me. I have mostly used them for walking the dog, and taking out the trash, etc. and they've been fine for that. I definitely wouldn't go for a run longer than a couple miles, but they're good for around there house or gym shoes. I took them on a 2 mile hike (forgot my boots) and didn't have any issues. The one thing I don't really like is that the heel slips a little bit with most of my socks."
"Nice quality, arrived quickly & as expected."
wish they were adjustable
"I love these shoes, comfort!"
Many compliments!!!!
My son is a small 6yr old.  I got then 6 fits perfect but wish I would have went up a size.
"LOVE these boots.  They are so comfortable!  I have narrow feet and they fit perfectly....not sliding around like I am in my ""big box"" rain boots.  If you have wide feet you will not want to buy these, but if you have narrower feet you will love them!  Love the red color too!"
BEST BOOTS and Best Boot dressing ever!!!
I was looking for a case to give to a friend of mine for her collection. This turned out to be the best thing! She loves it and it holds all of her collection neatly and safely.
Bought these for my granddaughters to add to their charm bracelets. Great price - quick delivery - quality product = happy grandma
"I bought 3 pairs of El Naturalista shoes, including this one. All of them are very stylish, and the leather is soft and of excellent quality. However ALL of them are very narrow. I wear regular width shoes and never had a problem buying shoes in stores or online, this is the first time. Buy only if you have skinny/ narrow feet."
"For some reason, I was expecting this to be more like a thin sweater material (like cashmere), but it's not. It's stretchy and more like a shirt, but I really like the way the material feels.  It's thin enough to be worn in fall, but can be worn in winter with a coat or jacket. It's long enough to be worn with leggings, which is why I bought it. I'm 5'8, and my weight fluctuates between 140-145. The large fits me like a glove and looks beautiful. The color is gorgeous, even prettier green in person. I'm very happy with this order."
very pretty and of course I love hearts and am planning to buy some of the other colors as well.  the price and what I got blew me away.  came quickly about a week
"The best material for a blazer, and it breathes...perfect for fall!"
"I wore it nearly 4 months, no wrinkle.  Sometimes sleep with it at my office, again no wrinkles. After wash, no iron needed. So I bought second pant."
"A very nice watch for the price.  This is my daily use watch and it has held up well so far.  It looks good, has a good weight without being too heavy."
"Received today...pleasantly surprised. Ordered 8 1/2 and the fit is right on which is what my normal size is in Merrells, Easy Spirit, Teva, Nike. I like the black color as I purchased for France this summer as my Travex:  pants, shorts, skirts all mostly black. Anyways... I have added already a memory foam insert as my 54 year old feet would not do well without. The shoes fit well and do no slip with thin sock. I will be wearing no show travel socks as my feet do best this way. Looks to be good on wet cobblestone. Like that they are not too heavy as bringing only a lightweight backpack for 3-4 weeks. I will have my Merrells, Tevas, and these... Looks like I am set!"
I saw a friend who had these and had to order them. They are so cushy and can't wait to wear them during summer.
"Love this. It's so light weight and a great light cover up. A local store used to sell similar products and went under, so happy to have found this again. Just ordered another color. This is durable and lasts forever."
"These socks are expensive and worth the cost.  They are soft and silky, light-weight but warm.  What I didn't expect is that they are amazingly durable.  A very good buy."
"These shoes are awesomely comfortable right out of the box!! Perfect height and width light weight with
a wonderfully flexible sole.
Might run big if You have a slim/narrow foot, mine is a medium width so ran perfect . It's a casual shoe,  great with slacks but will still look nice with simple dress or a skirt. I think they are going to be fabulous for my up coming Convention,.
Finally I have found a comfortable shoe!! Loved them so much bought them in the chocolate brown ...now I'm going to throw up all my other shoes, I'm so happy.
  Teva NEVER disappoints"
MAKES ME FEEL SEXXY
Order one size up on this dress. It hits above the knees. Very comfy dress that can go to the office or out for dinner. The aqua color is awesome and the cotton is wonderful in humidity. A classic that will stay in your closet for some time.
I get more compliments on this bag! I personally love it and feel cool carrying it. The studs make it a bit heavy so I just try to pack it lightly. A good seller too. Cannot wait to purchase more bags from them.
"Great, small straight post exactly what I need.."
Love the blue! Really cute
As usual PattyBoutik does not disappoint! Flattering and comfy top
"Beautiful.  The stones are well matched, with great green depth.  The scroll work on the silver surrounding the stones is quite lovely.  Sizing was spot on.  Very pleased with this gemstone ring."
"Some of their newer shoes are large. If you are used to being a size 41, get the 41. They did not mess with the sizing of these."
This dress is really super cute! It's surprisingly great quality. Sometimes you luck out with this type of clothing. It is also lined. A new fav. Not too heavy...you can wear in humid weather.
"Live these keg gongs although I will treat them more like leggings and cover my butt. I am 5'9"" 130 lbs and usually get a small in most pants but didn't want too tight a fit and so got a M. Glad I did although I bet a S would have fit. But I like a little ""give"" now at my age. I'm 58 and plan on wearing these with long rayon tops for work and sandles this summer at my office job. A casual easy look. They fit great and the fabric feels sturdy and I love the details on the sides. Glad I got them. I bought the tan zipper model and if they had the same thing in navy I would get them too, but the navy don't have the zippers. Darn!"
This is a great bra!  Comparable to a $50.00 bra I just bought...I will purchase this item again.  No more $50.00 bras...great find 
This is a beautiful dress. Loved the fit. It had a small spot in the front. That was all you saw. I ordered it on Prime day and would re order it but its now more.
"My wife, who looks like a model, looks even more gorgeous in these.
The only negative is that the tortoise print looks a little too unnatural. But they look so good overall that I won't take any stars off for that."
"This is the most comfortable show I have ever worn.  I have heel spurs and bunions from wearing poorly fitting shoes my entire life.  These shoes are so light, it feels like your wearing nothing at all. My feet are not tiny and these shoes don't give the clown look effect that many shoes do.  I thought I wouldn't like the no laces type but it is great.  They stay on my feet and the memory foam is just so blissful.  The only drawback...memory foam is pretty much exhausted after about 3 months or so but the shoe is still quite comfy even with the foam gone. My current pair are 9 months old and not a tear, loose stitch or anything other that normal wear and tear. I am extremely rough on shoes, purchasing new ones every 3-4 months but these have held their own. I just purchased a black pair to wear inside of my steel toe over shoes for work.  I want the comfort at work that I have in my everyday life.  It means a lot to get up without having pain in my feet and this shoe gets me there.  Give them a try and see how you feel.  Don't just wear them for a day because at first they feel a little odd, not painful just not what I'm used to.  I'm probably going to order multiples in this shoe because every time I find anything I like, it ends up discontinued. My current ones will become lawn cutting shoes because they are still comfy enough for that. To sum up, freaking LOOOOVE this shoe!!!"
"This company is one of the best I have others made by them. This Trump hat is really well made with good material, the logo stands out with this black back ground. Looking to support our president for all of six years, this shows your a winner!!"
"I bought several pairs of women's toe toppers they fit just right and was very good , these toe toppers are very soft i will buy them again"
Nice fabric and flows very well. Will buy other colors.
"I like to use these around the house and for casual errands.  For hiking and long walks I would not recommend them.

January 2016 update: These are holding up far longer than expected."
Beautiful skirt. Recommend.
"Beautiful dress, fit as expected, fas shipping,  and I received lots of compliments.  Thank you"
Nice outfit that fits well and will last the 5 washes before my son outgrows it.
Beautiful ring. The stone was a bit larger than I expected but I don't mind. I love rings and wanted a ring to wear with my band everyday.
Very feminine and comfortable
nice comfortable tee!!
Husband is happy with his shoes.
Should have gone 14.
"Love these, This is my second pair.
I wear them all the time in summer.
Super comfortable and cute - definitely get them."
"The knee highs were of a very nice quality. The price was reasonable. What else can I say, their socks."
"A little long and wide in the heel only..  Otherwise, the fit is similar to other Cobb Hill shoes I've purchased.  A couple of heel grippers placed on the inside of the heels, helped with the problem.  It would have fit better had the strap anchoring one side to the other with velcro been wider and closer to the ankle than the toes.  (I particularly like the Parker shoe from Cobb Hill . . . no slippage of the heel when I walk with these shoes.)"
Purchased for my daughter to wear for my nieces wedding. She loves it and it looks beautiful on her. Super fast delivery too!
"very nice dress and my 3 year old loves it. It rotates with her other dresses depending on what she princess she decides she wants to be when she wakes up. It is easy to get on and has an opening with velcro in the back. Anyway, I wish it was a little bigger, she is an average 3 year old and its fits her good, which is ok but does not leave much room for growth. I don't see any way that this would fit a five or six year old"
I live in this now
They got delivered on time. They were so comfortable. I wore them while I was in Wisconsin dells and we did a lot of walking at the resort. The bottom gripped really well to the floor
Very nice..fits beautifully.
Absolute adorable! My 5 year old(who is big/tall for his age) wore this for homecoming prince this year.  He looked adorable and it fit perfectly!
"I loved these shoes the second I put them on.  And I walk a LOT.  I'm so happy with them, I would buy them in every color available!"
"Love the color, style and the way they fit"
Warm and fit great. Helps fill out boot since my foot is narrower then boot when worn with socks
"Bought this to replace a 12-ish year old American Tourister suitcase that finally gave up the ghost on its zipper (that sucker went all over the globe!). This one is a touch wider than the old one but still does NOT incur oversized bag fees.
The four spinner wheels are a nice addition to the the bottom along with the already existing design with pull handle. DO make sure to get ALL of the shipping plastic wrap out of the wheels or it will not want to track straight when you're walking with it.
A lock/locking mechanism would make this a 5 star bag."
"Excellent purse.  All my stuff stays very well organized and I don't have to dig to find anything.  Many pockets, including deep ones.  Would definitely buy this purse again.  Nice appearance.  Pretty blue interior."
Great belt. Great value
"In faith I bought a few of these bras in different colors, and so far I'm really happy with them! The bra stays put without straps or wires (even after a long day of walking and/or childcare), and it is comfortable to wear all day!
I'm keeping my rating at 4/5 stars, and will change it depending on how they hold up after a few washings."
Love the jacket. Was told to buy a size larger and this was much larger than I expected
supper cute!!!!
"Not sure I would run in these, but they are a very nice walking shoe. The memory foam is very comfortable. The only issue I have is that they don't seem to have a lot of arch support. It feels to me as though it has a flat bed of foam without much of an arch. Maybe it's not needed, only time will tell."
"These sandals are too stinkin cute! They compliment any outfit, and they are pretty comfy. The only reason they didn't get a five is they slight rub along the inside of my toes. That being said, I'm a half size in shoes, so I had to order the next full size in this style."
"I love this little necklace. It's actually rather large, and does come on a metal chain. It's a little bluer than in the picture, but it's really pretty. If you're a fan of seahorses, this is for you. Especially for pennies on the dollar! Ships fast."
"I have been wearing Mizuno for years, love this shoe. I have high arches and bunions. I order one size up and use Superfeet. Fits great."
love this shirt. mens sizes run bigger so i can wear a 2x. wore it to my biology final just for the professor! lol
I bought this watch to replace a Seiko that had too many features to be used. This watch does everything I need (just tell the time) for a very good price. Also I have a very large wrist which it fits snuggly with just the right amount of stretch.
"This is the best heating pad I have ever used!! I love that is stays where you put it because of the ""belt"". Definitely worth the extra $$$."
"just got back from Hawaii, wore this with bike shorts instead of shortie wetsuit, it was amazing! No sunburn, stayed warm in water, did not overheat on land, I even wore it hiking as sun protection. I have had skin cancer 4 times and have had allergic reactions to sunscreen, this shirt is the answer to my issues. I will be getting another one for nest trip."
"A Little brighter in color than depicted in photo. However, it is absolutely perfect for my Tina Belcher costume."
Got this for my 2 year old nephew for his birthday and he absolutely loved it! Good quality shirt for the price.
"Works very well holding one dollar or multiple bills. have not put credit cards and bills in is yet but expect they will all fit nicely.
Keeps its shape no matter how far a reasonable wad of bills will stretch it."
"great watch ....big display, lite and it does what it says ....very happy"
"Great shoes, prompt service"
My hubby likes to wear these under his swim trunks.  They fit and dry quickly.
Hun-ty!!!! I love these jeans. I tried them on first because I'm wearing them this weekend & they fit like a glove. They're absolutely my go to jeans from now on. I have to get more colors lol
"Nice colors, fits well, washes well (no fading/bleeding of color).  The logo and collars do need ironing after a few washes."
"For beginner dance shoes these are great.  There's no support.  I definitely appreciate they included a brush for the bottoms of the shoes, and a bag.  I will buy this product again."
"Nice chain. I thought it was shorter than it was, but I was mistaken. Would recommend"
"These are my third pair of pajamas from White Orchid, and am very pleased with them.  They are made of extremely soft knit and are priced right.  I will continue to buy this brand."
"the toe box seems to be a bit small on these running shoes.  they looked really nice, i liked the colors. but they were just  a bit small and did not fit right."
"Finally! A sports shirt for athletic women. This shirt is wider in the shoulders and is nicely fitted without pulling across the back or lower neckline opening. for broad shouldered women, the sleeves don't turn into pixie sleeves when you put it on. The shirt is longer than most sport shirts and seems tighter at the bottom because it is longer. But it does fit well. You can wear it out or in and don't have the problem of flashing everyone if you squat in this shirt. The material is light, but very breathable. The collar is tightly woven and doesn't lose shape."
"I bought this suit in the size 10/12, which is what I normally wear.  The suit fits great.  I'm a 36 DD and the top is too small.  I'd say it's a 36 C if I had to guess.  It also has soft cups and an underwire.  Probably won't swim in it but it will be fine to wear on my cruise.  Great price too."
"Depending on how you like your clothes to fit, I'd read the following. If you like the modern fit, tight enough to show more than curves, then buy your regular size.  If you want slightly curve hugging, one size up.....and so forth.  I'm 50, 5'4"", 158 lbs and now have ""lumps and more lumps""  where their used to be smooth non-lumpy skin ....I've gained weight.  I usually now wear a large, sometimes anot XL, I like to camouflage my self-consciousness.  Based on other reviews, I bought one xxl and one xxxl.  They are both flattering.  The ruching is  great tummy flattering look.  I  like the fit of the xxl the best, but will buy again in either size.  The material is light weight and thin.  A cami underneath is good for the larger size to kee the shirt more in place.  Overall a good purchase.  Dressier than a plain tee-shirt, can be dressed up more with a scarf or necklace....but not too much to be just casual."
"This is really nice, but mine came with a couple of scuff marks on front and back - scuffs were deep into leather"
"I love eBags!  For most travel, especially international, we use the eBag cubes. I needed a new travel duffel to hold 3-4 weeks of stuff and I was hooked on this Mother Lode size and flexibility.  Will update the review once I've come back from our next planned international excursion.  Can't wait to use this duffel."
"Exactly what I needed to help hid the straps.  The pink is a nice addition other than just having beige, white, and black.  I happen TI have one pink bra and shirt that I plan to use it with."
"really cute sandals and surprisingly comfortable! I wasn't expecting much given they're relatively inexpensive sandals but they are really great! super stylish and unique, not like your typical flip flops. Relatively easy on/off with the zipper. I haven't done long walks in them but for general everyday use (errands, etc) they haven't caused any issues with rubbing, blisters, or discomfort from the thin sole. I saw another reviewer say they looks ""star wars-y"" and I agree, in a good way!"
"Cant say anything about the quality because ring has not been worn yet, however, this is rating based on first impressions. Ring does not come with a box, it comes in a bag. For the price, cant complain. Ring seems to be sturdy but not heavy. The curved edges are nice, seems to be comfortable the few mins my fianc wore it. However, it runs about a half size too small. He tried on rings at a big name jeweler and based on their measurements, hes a 9.5. I ordered this in a 9.5, it goes on, but its slightly snug. I will return for a 10.

Also, for people that complain about this ring chipping or breaking if you drop/slam it with force: it is supposed to! Tungsten is a hard metal which will break under pressure. Not saying youll likely to end up in a situation where youll need to have your ring removed by emergency personnels, but if you do, you want a ring thats going to break so they don't have to cut off your finger. Just saying, its something to keep in mind if you're going to wear it day in and day out."
I really like these. The fabric they use on these is very soft feeling and stretchy. They fit well but a tiny bit more loose than I would normally want. They are well made and I feel they are worth the price.
"I love these shirts! I work in a professional environment and they look great and feel really flexible and breathable. Definitely becoming one of my favorites, and for the price can't beat it!"
Fabulous hat. Might buy another in a different color!!
I love this.  I will be buying it in most of the muted colors as soon as possible. Purple is beautiful.  It is long and elegant and I can't wait to wear it with tank tops and out for just a little bit of arm coverage.
Its a cute coat but it runs very small. My 4T fits more like a 2T.
"I intentionally bought these a size down because they are relaxed fit & they fit as they should. The color is NOT comparable to what is pictured, that's why I gave them 4 stars. I purchased the darker hue but the color in person is more like a cross between the 2 colors pictured. Definitely not as dark as shown but not as light as pictured either."
They fit really well...thank you!
"I love these socks--they are fun, thick but not too thick, and remind me of my fave parts of Bridget Jones' Diary (full handlebar mustache on each shin + diamond-pattern jumper)."
Simple but elegant design
"To start with what really matters when buying a bra... I'm a 36 G, so you know it is really difficult to find a sports bra.  This one works.  I gave it 4 stars only because I feel it comes up a little oddly high in the front, but I'm guessing that's why I don't bounce as much.  I do still bounce a bit... impossible not to, but I don't feel myself bounce.  Good bra.  Buy this one, not the zipper front one.  That turned me into a very uncomfortable Madonna.  I'm returning that one; keeping this one."
"These socks were exactly what I was looking for in socks. I needed light-weight, low-cut or no-show socks that were cheap and available in a couple of colors. These socks claim to be no-show but I find that they show around 1cm above a sneaker. This is perfect for what I wanted but just be aware these are not exactly ""No-show"" even on size 10.5(mens) feet.

The size of the socks straight from the packaging can be seen in the photos I have attached.

Each box came with 6 pairs of socks (12 individual socks total).

White and black both fit the same and have been washed several times with no shrinkage that is noticeable.

Pros:
*light-weight--Breathes well even in California heat
*Low cost
*Cut low

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
Just be aware that these socks on a size 10.5(Male US) still show a bit.

Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."
"These fit quite well and look really good! True to size also, I wear a 7.5 and that is what I ordered."
thumbs up so far
Nice shirts.  Fruit of the Loom quality you love and expect.
Love my Saucony shoes
"These have the perfect amount of stretch, and AMAZINGLY have no gap in the back, no muffin top in the front. Great mom jeans that don't look mommish."
My friend love this hoodie!
Fashionably perfect for my little princess.. Everyone had nice comments to say about this coat. Bright and vibrant for the winter weather! -and it does the job of keeping her warm. She loves it!!!
"I have PTSD and epilepsy, a  lousy combination. The drugs I take for both make me, unstable to say the least. These shoes stick like glue to any surface, including the parquet floors in our home. They have saved me many a slip and fall,including sailing down a flight of stairs, which at 58, really hurts."
"The shoes fit well, I've already run over 10 miles in them and have not had trouble breaking them in."
My sister wears them all the time
Ordered the Large but they run a little on the small side.
Great it holds lots!
"Thick, quality leather bag in a beautiful design!  Stands up to daily use, so far only a few loose thread ends as you might expect from anything machine-sewn.  Getting compliments when I take it out.  The interior lining is a thick fabric, not that thin material in other purses that falls apart after a few months.  This is my everyday bag and holds almost everything I want; can even cram in the iPad if I have to.  Fits wallet, checkbooks, small makeup bag, travel medicine bottles, sunglasses, keys, phone, etc.  The hardware is a goldtone, which I usually don't like, but it is a pale yellow and obviously high quality so I don't even mind that it's not silver.  I was looking for a bag that would last years instead of months and am very happy with my purchase!"
"More great cubes. Seriously, they are great. I should have ordered more of the smaller sizes. Perfect for traveling, of course."
"Needed a sturdy bag for a vacation to multiple theme parks that was going to be hands free and this was the perfect bag! It came well made and well lined with quality zippers and a wide strap that did not cut into my sholder. Love this bag , a great value and quality product."
I loved the shoes.  Unfortunately they cut into my bunion so I had to return them.  I really wished I could have worn them since they are so attractive.
This was a second pair of these shoes but in different color. They are perfect!! I might buy them again in a larger size :-)
This necklace was bought for my daughters birthday. She is 9. I wouldn't suggest this one for an adult but it is great for a little girl. The case is really cute too.
"These were great, light on the nose and really cool case for the low price."
I use it every time I run. Keeps everything secure and doesn't interfere with the way I run.
"I love these sticky bras because I wear a lot of clothes that look best when no bra straps are visible. They are lightweight, the sticky adhesive is strong but does not hurt to take off, and the color makes it easy to hide under clothes. Please note I am reviewing this product as someone with a small chest (A/B cup); I am not sure what the fit is like or how functional these bras are for larger chested women. I have friends with larger chests that like these sorts of bras, but wear them knowing they have little support depending on the bra size. These bras function mostly for coverage and a little extra padding. This product is the best one on the market - I get at least 5-10 uses out of these bras before the sticky adhesive begins to wear off. I can then get 5-10 more uses out of them when their stickiness starts to wear out. So far, I've used this particular bra 3 times and it's still holding up very well. Some friends say that you can wash these bras and they will retain their stickiness, but I haven't had such luck. The reason I bought this bra from this seller is because some sellers advertise for lower prices, but take 30 days or more to ship because it's from Asia. This one offers Amazon Prime, so I got it in 2 days!! Overall, a great product and a lifesaver to prevent wardrobe malfunctions. The only thing (very small critique) is that the clear bag it came in was a bit cheap and had a different serial code stained on it. However, I don't even plan on using the bag so no worries :)"
I am extremely happy with this sweater!  I am a true fan of the PattyBoutik clothing line!  Can't wait for cooler weather to wear it.
Grandson likes a lot
My New Balance Men's BB82 Basketball Shoe arrived on time and in good condition.  It surpassed my expectations.  The shoes are really comfortable.  I recommend purchasing this product.  I give this product a 5 star rating.
"I gave 4 stars because the product for the price is amazing! Love the material and the firm shape it gives. And I read all of the previous reviews saying to order 4 sizes larger, which I did, but still it was a little small. I am 5'7 and normally wear XL to 1X so I ordered a 5X. I had to loosen the back all the way and just barely fit into it. So I say go at least 5 sizes up! Otherwise I'm very happy with the product! I know I'm large but I can't imagine who could fit into the S or M size other than a child..."
"excellent shoe to dress up or down. easy to walk in for long periods. the back of the heel sometimes rubs up against my back right anke ( I'm 5'5"") but its not a deal breaker. Its my leg not the shoe. I receive alot of compliments on this shoe when i wear it."
Very very blue. Very very comfortable.
Love the look and feel of these shoes.  So cute and fit perfect.  Highly recommended.  Arrived quickly and was on SALE so an awesome price.
"My husband loves these boots!  Always has been a Merrell fan,  but the Mid Hiking Moab is his favorite now."
I BOUGHT TWO AND THEY ARE VERY NICE.
I bought this dress for a funeral. I was 7 months pregnant 5'2 140 lbs and bought the medium. It worked out really well. The waste part of the dress is nice and high and hits just below your breast line  so it was perfect for my baby bump! If I wasn't pregnant I would've bought a size small. The dress was really nice quality! Material is very heavy and detailed! Really a beautiful dress that seemed like it was expensive. Highly recommend!
The best baby shoes ever. Why wear socks when you can wear socks and shoes?? That never fall off? And that can be worn daily for nearly 4 months by a kicky infant and still look nearly good as new? No other article of clothing has stayed in good condition like these. Totally worth the cost!
"This is a handy back pack. I love how it comes folded in its self, as big as a small make up bag. Easy to unfold and when you are done, it was pretty easy to fold it back up and it takes up no room! This is a great back pack for pretty much anyone or anything, kids going to school, going on a walk, hiking, using it for business stuff, carrying lunches, water. It is water proof, it is a nice nylon, you have a mesh side pocket on one side, and a zipper pocket on the other side, there is a front pocket and the main pocket, very roomy. I only found one small flaw, which isn't a big deal & diesnt interfere with anything, the mesh pocket on the side is sewn crooked, but not a big deal. It's a great back pack for the price. The straps have nylon on the back, kinda keeps it from getting to hot. Everything seems sturdy on here, zippers are sturdy strong. All the other parts that are sewn I found no problems. I definitely would recommend this. I was given this at a discount for my honest review, this is my honest review."
A little tight in the toes of you have wide feet.
"Live in these in the summer, finally one with arch support that I can wear all day. So nice to just slip on"
Great price. Great glamour.k
I HAVE HARD FEET TO PLEASE MY FEET LIKE THESE
"kiiks very nice, good texture"

The bottoms are very low cut in the front and back and they are very cheeky. They have a cute rouched stitching down the back. I am 5'3"" and about 115lbs. The small fit me perfectly.
The top can be a little bit confusing when you pull it out of the packaging. It does not come tied so I originally tied the top the wrong way. If the fabric for the top seems to hang straight down instead of at an angle, then you're wearing it wrong. (some of the reviews show the swim suit being worn this way.) Make sure the adjustable part for the triangle top is underneath the chest. The fabric should be hanging down from the top of the triangles.
This swim suit is very easy to adjust. It comes with padding in the top that can be removed.
*I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review"
I love my CowCow dresses!
"As usual, Saucony has provided a solid running shoe at a great price. This is a little smaller fit than my Cohesion 8 in the same size, but not enough to matter."
Arrived and packaging was as expected. Fruit of the loom socks women's ankle white. Exactly what i ordered Thank you
True to size made very well. Good quality of fabric
Wonderful!  It is hard to find pajama pants with a long inseam!  They are so comfortable!!
Bought these for my husband and I for a Mickey/Minnie costume.  They were comfortable to wear and stayed on pretty well.  Just what we wanted.
"Have other pairs of Betsey Johnson camera earrings...everyone remarks on how interesting they are with cameras as the major design.
Ordered more because I sometimes misplace them."
"The shoe can be casual or dressed up and yet all the comforts of slippers. They are a little big but that is common with my skinny calves and narrow feet, socks does the job for fit. Having the wedge, soft cushion and low heel it is for all day wear, great with my jeans tucked inside. Wish they came in sand color I would buy another pair."
SO COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO STYLE
"This pair of sandals are the best!!!!!Its so comfortable and exactly what i needed.  I normally wear a size 5.5 so i ordered size 5 hoping it would fit my skinny feet perfectly but its a tiny bit long.the costumer service is also good, i emailed them asking when the black one size 5 would be available and they told me it would be available in a few days. great product. Overall, I would highly recommend this!!"
Perfect product! Very fast shipping!! Thank you very much!!!
"Fits perfectly and is super comfortable! I normally wear a small, and purchased a small which fits beautifully. Great purchase for the price."
"I like it a lot, but it's short even on my 5'2 frame.  The shirt ends just above my hips.  Would love it if it were an inch or, two longer. As is, it's still flattering with my leggings and I'm glad to have it.  Just wish it completely covered my rump and it does not."
"""Thank you FitFlop. I've been struggling with your sizing & styling to find a fit for this yr & this Rola is just right!"" I've been wearing FF for yrs & am acquainted with their fitting variances. When they fit, there's not another, better shoe for me. I've worn them in all terrains & climates. Hiked,  beach hopped, you name it.
For other customers' reference, I wear a size 8 , have narrow feet with high arches. I've learned that the sandals with the straps that come up from the back of the sole tend to fit me better. Then I tried the Halo style & the small Halos cut into my feet. That disheartened me & then the Rola arrived today & is completely comfortable"
I purchased this for the Amazon Prime occasion and it is simply gorgeous!
"Really cute comfortable shorts for me. I have never liked long ""walking shorts"" but also not into any ""daisy dukes"" either as I am now a Grandmother...just not really great. These are just right though. I also have an abdominal scar from surgeries so careful where waistbands lands on my belly. I went by the photo and bought a Medium at a discounted price in return for my trial and true feedback on these shorts. They are just right for me at 5'5"" and 105 pounds. I usually buy smalls now but with this material I was concerned there could be some shrinkage and so I got Mediums. The material is like a thin sweat shirt material and a drawstring waistband which I also like. These didn't really shrink at all and now I think these will be my new fave shorts this summer. I bought the black also as in the pic and am really happy with the color as they will match about anything I wear on top. They do have 2 side pockets that do not go very deep but can carry a couple of small things without the need to carry a purse if you are going someplace you would rather not such as a pool or beach area. The bottom cuffs are sewn on each side and have a couple of tacked areas to hold the fold up so they really can't be let down just in case that was a question."
I love Dansko sandals.  Dansko has saved my feet!
"This bra is very comfortable stretch material. The material is thin so if you are wanting thicker material bra then look elsewhere.
The band at bottom is slightly narrow and bunches at the base of the breast. I would consider buying this again"
"I've never used this brand but I'm totally impressed. The shade is just right - although during summer when tanned I plan to switch it up a bit - and the coverage is excellent. I have a tendency to get red blotchy skin and this covers it entirely. It's gentle, non-irritating (so far) and easy to apply. If I were to have a wish list, I'd really enjoy a bit more natural ingredient list but this is certainly better than most as far as irritation/sensitivity goes. The case also feels solid enough to toss into a purse without problem. Overall very pleased!"
Everyone loved the shirt
I don't doubt for one second the key/lock feature in this box is a plus for many users but in my particular need is very annoying it locks itself overtime I close it and the way I have it organized in my cabinet the lock release is not as easy accessible as I'd like.
Was a gift for husb.  He luvs it!
Exactly as advertised! Thank you!
"I like these boots. they are good quality and fit just as expected. I wear them often and i would consider them more of a ""fawn ish"" color. They are very tight around the calf and looser around that ankle which causes a bunchy/saggy spot at the ankle. They wear as more a slouchy boot vs. riding boot on me"
"I got a lot of compliments on this sweater. Tried to order it in 2013, but it was already sold out. Glad I kept it in my wish list because it was a great pickup for 2014. I'm 6'2, 180lbs and the large fit perfectly."
"I love these,  but I recommend sizing up if you want roomier pants. The green is pretty."
It's a really hot costume!
Kept my little one covered but cool on our recent camping trip. Great since he's too young for sunscreen yet.
"I bought a pair each of regular fit, straight leg, zipper fly Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler jeans.  The Levi's(505) were $40, the Lee's $32, and the Wrangler's $20. I washed all of them once, in cold water.  They all fit about the same.  The construction seems to be about the same too.  All had 5 belt loops and reinforced the same points.  They all were about the same weight denin.  One difference I could find was that the Levi's had two rivets on the coin pocket while the Lee's and Wranglers had one rivet there and sewed the other side of the coin pocket into the main pocket seam. Also, the Levi's print your jean size on the outside label, while the Lee's and Wranglers do not.  Both the Levi's and Lee have a double stitched external inseam on the inside of the legs and a concealed inseam on the outside of the legs.  The Wranglers reversed this with the concealed inseam on the inside and a double stitched seam on the outside.  The length of the inseam, compared to the advertised length, was pretty close, with the Lee's being the longest, and the Wranglers the shortest.

I would say the Levi's were good jeans, but were they worth the price difference?

Overall, I would say they all three pairs look like they will be fine over the longer term.  So perhaps the price difference and your preference for brands might be the deciding factor."
Fits perfect. Wife loves it!
Not a bad shirt
A little confused because the box said 8.5 as ordered but the boots say 8.0M so I'm not sure what size I actually got. They fit so I won't be returning.
"Look nice, fit well, and very comfortable.  No complaints here.  They keep my feet warm when the hardwood floors are cold in the winter, so I'm happy."
These shoes are stylish AND comfortable.  These are my first shoes by Gentle Souls and I will be purchasing more of this brand.  I didn't realize until I received my shoes that Gentle Souls is a Kenneth Cole company. I guess that accounts for the great styles.
"I'm loving the color, the price and it arrived even before expected arrival date"
"I wore 1  pair of these for 3 days hiking on the AT.  Gross right?  No, not really, I rinsed them out each night.  They were dry by the next morning.  The weird thing is they didn't feel sweat soaked at the end of the day.  I didn't get any chaffing at all.  I bought an earlier pair of Archy's that were more like panty hose underwear, they were too hot and not very durable.  These are much better."
"Perfect for travel!  I bought this to use for a vacation that had multiple stops and hotels. This cross body bag had a numerous secure pockets for my passport, various itineraries, phone, cash and credit cards."
Bought these for my son's culinary class.  He loves them.
These earrings are really comfy to wear 24/7. I was looking for jewelry to wear in my cartilage piercing and these fit nicely. I sleep with them in all the time and it never bothers me.
Omg I love the earrings they are totally adorable
These  shoes are great for working in  they are mostly water proof  I was walking in somewhat long grass that had been rained on and for the first time my feet felt a little damp  they are very comfortable to wear and have a god fit  haven't hiked in them yet and can't wait  exceeds my expectations
"I bought these pair of jeans for my friend and he loves it... i bought size 34 and yhey fit him perfect. i wear 34 but i coludnt put them on, they were too tight for me. like these jeans are made for skinny people. nice jeans, you can never go wrong with levis"
"Beautiful, fit perfectly!!! Also nice material!"
Did what I needed it for on a patriotic themed party .
Pretty and casual or dressy love it and got many complements on it.
"This product is beautifully made with the appearance of a Celtic or old English design.  The wonderful appeal of amber is bubble like appearance deep within the amber.  This is because Amber is not a stone, but petrified tree sap.  Amber is the only gem that is never cold to the touch, but always warm.  The history of amber is to bring to it wearer the warmth of love and protection against all kinds of negativity.

Based on the appearance and workmanship of this item, I would purchase from this seller again."
Levi's button fly fits the same as they did 30 years ago same quality been wearing Levi's jeans for 40 years
"Got it as gift for my mother..,she loved and I loved it even more :) It's a beautiful peace with each pearl looked stunning.
Got Pearls for first time then ordered more from Pearl Source for myself. Treat for eyes and delight to hold to heart."
"Make sure to get one size bigger or a size and a half bigger if u like them a little bigger than your feet. I prefer my sandals just a little bigger. I wear a size 5 but ordered a size 6. They fit perfectly w a little extra room. A 6.5 would have looked good too. They look exactly like the picture, so precious!  They are very light feeling and cheaper quality but nobody would ever know. They look like good quality when u wear them so no worries.  They are such a low price that I don't care about that. They are very comfortable too. I'd order more sandals from them in the future. Shipping was fast as well!"
"This is the third pair of Go Walks that I have purchased. I wear them to work as I work on a campus with hills and uneven pavement. They are comfortable and I feel they provide a good grip when walking. They do not have much arch support, if any. But, they look nice and launder wonderfully."
"I thought that this track suit was so cute and adorable. I got it for a really great deal and the material was of very good quality. It also was a white white, not faded or anything of that sort. I just with there were more deals like this everyday since I live off of Amazon. My son was 3 at the time when I bought it, but it was expected to be a little bit large on him, and seems it was a little larger than regular's small size (probably more so the 5-7) age range since than starting at 4.  I would defiantly buy again of course since the quality is well made, and it doesn't shirt after washing. My son has worn this outfit multiple times and people think we spent close to $60-80 on this outfit when it was only a fraction of it.  Defiantly will buy again."
"Great coat,order up a size."
I needed flats for a wedding and these fit the bill! Nice color but still bling! Will wear these and feel beautiful
"I have found bamboo socks to be very comfortable and effective in wicking away moisture.
My only general complaint is that they wear out quickly.  Too soon to tell with this set."
"Very nice for the price, fit my sons 5XL frame wonderfully,  pants are very long but easily altered.  Arrived on time.  Had to contact seller regarding a message I received about a possible delay in shipping - do not think they handled my inquiry very professionally.  I would recommend the product however."
These gloves just arrived today & I'm in LOVE! I like that the elastic isn't to loose like other gloves I've purchased. They seem to be well made! I did order the small since my hands are small for an adult.. I cannot even wear adult lady gloves since they are too long & always have to go to the kids sections.. These are GREAT! They do snag easy but ALL gloves like these do that. Overall VERY impressed!
The tutu came on time and is as seen in this picture but I like to wear the pink on top.
"Perfect for my daughter's school uniform!  They must wear a belt with a shirt tucked in and her old leather belt was too bulky and dug into her sides after 8 hours at school. She is really bony and skinny, and it was uncomfortable. This belt has been a lifesaver. It not only meets dress code standards, it also is super comfortable and stretchy. Even though is has elasticity, it still provides a snug fit without the stiffness of a leather belt. She has been using it for a couple weeks now and loves it! The clasp is very easy and lightweight - reminds me of a paracord bracelet clasp.  If only it came in khaki as well. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest , unbiased review."
"I saw these shoes in the bridal store when I bought my wedding dress and immediately fell in love with them. I found them on Amazon for cheaper which was an extra bonus. As the other reviewer said, they are a little unstable, but as long as you know how to walk in heels, you should be fine. They're not the most comfortable shoes, but most heels hurt my feet anyway so I will buy some of the gel inserts for heels."
"They are cute, comfy, versatile, made well, inexpensive but not cheap looking. Will buy Jelly Pop Shoes Footwear again!"
I ordered an XL following the advice of the comments but the material is so fine that it stretched with the first wearing. I still like it but I would like the fit better if it was a little more fitted
Perfect fit. Waist is perfect along with the long legs. Great for young boys going through growth spurts
Has lasted many flights and over a year.  Good quality
"Just the most comfortable sandal ever, I have knee replacements and these are the only footwear
that I walk normal in with no pain. The sole is so cushy, it gives as you walk and you feel like you are
bouncing along on clouds, seriously, just footwear heaven !  I think I'll buy a spare pair for the future."
Was perfect for our trip to Disney!
"Got this in a L size.  Fits very nice.  5'5"" 150 lbs.  The pink is sweet.  Covers nicely."
"Great fit, great material, looks really great on me and seems to be well made!"
A replacement for husband's old pair of suspenders.  He likes them and they serve their purpose.
"I work 24-hr shifts at the hospital, and these do a great job at keeping my feet happy.  I prefer these over tennis shoes a million times over, and they are, in my opinion, superior to the classic, hard soled Danskos people seem to obsess over."
"These are very well made for the price. Like the style, wanted a pair but, I didn't want to spend $$ on the name brand.
I bought a size larger than normal, glad I did."
"Ordered 18 months for my 10 month old and they fit well. They are a little long and slightly baggy, but stay on well and are soft and comfortable. Will buy again"
Very light weight and comfortable.  I bought these due to my tennis shoes at the time were hurting my heels.  These have more cushion and more sleek than bulky.
Very long... but I'm short 5'2
"perfect and snug. Just a basic, flattering long sleeve"
"Very pretty, fit true to size."
This item was to my expectation. My husband has not complained.
Fits 100 lb 11-year-old very well.  Adorable panda and the shorts are a nice contrast.  Fabric is a little thin on top but not quite see-thru.  OK for PJs.
Nice uniform shorts. They are well made. Thick fabric. Look very nice. Can be worn to work on greasy cars or worn out and look like nice shorts. Black hides a lot of dirt and stains so they stay looking nice. Little longer than my husband likes but they are what most of the younger guys like just below the knee.
"It was for my son,he is 5'11'',230#,he like them,fits very well,look nice on him. Everyone is happy."
Surprisingly a nice fit and light weight. A fun and inexpensive way to add some trend to your basic wardrobe. I'm between a 10-12 and the large fit well.
Great design and quality; perfect fit right out of the package!
Typical Halloween costume in regards to fabric and how well made it is. Read: not very well made. But the fit is spot on and it has a lot of fun pieces and with some doctoring can look really amazing. I have worn it twice and gotten rave reviews.
"Love these boots!  They fit great, they feel great!"
color was more green than picture showed
Looks good on me. Wore it with a white shirt and jeans and this made my outfit look so Cassy!
Burda
"Looks exactly as expected, easily read and the fabric is decent for the price I paid for it. If you're a fan of the band, I'd recommend it."
"These have the perfect pocket for your package.
They fit like a glove and are very comfortable."
"Comfortable, cute"
"5'7 176 pounds 36DDD (Soma)... size XL fit like a glove (white / black print)
- finally wore the dress to my great aunt's funeral. I had to pick my mom up from Memory Care - all the residents and staff were going crazy about how great this dress looks or reminds them of dresses they wore. All these residents are usually quiet ... but not today..."
Awesome shoe. Elastic is tight but expect it to become more comfortable with wear. Wide which is perfect. Would buy again deffinately recommend!
"im 6 ft tall and this is what big and tall replaced. the sleeves are fine when I extend my arm, the waist pockets are a nice touch. it is light and soft, since I work outdoors, it blocks the sun fine without getting me hot."
This was a gift for my brother. He loves it. Great quality and matches his KC luggage set.
Ballin fo sho
These are lularoe soft and a much lower price tag. Can't see through them.  Will continue to purchase!
"Really comfy. The covered elastic adds a  nice finish , and ups the comfort factor. I would have liked to be able to choose color; I'd pay more for that option."
My daughter was THRILLED to get this! She has been wanting this bag for a couple of years! It's a great cross-body!
I bought these for a Halloween costume. The quality was better than I expected. They looked fabulous and were so comfortable. Great product!
"Soft socks, fit well, great colors. My husband is pleased with them."
Little small great if I was 8years of age
"Top is stretchy and doesn't attract hair which is nice as I work at a vet.  Sometimes a pocket on these (I have a few colors) gets kinda floppy, like it's stretched out even though I don't use the pocket, so that's a little annoying.  Not annoying enough to keep me from buying more though."
Best shoes my husband ever worn!!!!!
I purchased this outfit for my daughter's baby doll.  It fit true to size and the outfit is so cute.  I would definitely purchase from this company again because you can definitely see the quality in the items!
"Clever little case for organizing cards, batteries, and the like. No complaints whatsoever."
Beautiful price more beautiful dress.
Very useful for bigger watches
I bought the shoes for my mom and love them
Super cute dress. Classy simple. Easy to keep clean and wrinkle free. Love it.
"Levi's 559 has always been my favorite jeans for casual wear. They fit perfectly for my size, which is athletic but not huge (huge would be 550 or just very baggy).

Also, the color and subtle shades are as good as the jeans that I have that cost 6 times more. Great jeans, great fit (with a belt), and really great color.

My only minor complaint is the waste seems to have gotten slightly larger for the same size, or the pants slightly baggier only on the top so that they slide down without a belt. This has not happened before and I am the same waste size. I don't know if it is to shift more to the baggy wear the kids enjoy without a belt, or the style is not as 70's with a belt (which is good), but when I wear a belt problem solved and the fit is A+."
"I bought this watch for my 10yr old daughter for school because it is awesome and nobody around will have one like it plus she will have to use her brain to tell the time. It took me just a minute to set up the date and time for this watch and another binary one for my son.
People said it didn't come with instructions but mine did. You just press the B button (bottom button) and hold until it flashes then use the A button to set the hour (the hour button will be lit up) once you have the hour set press the B button again (the minutes will then light up on the buttom) use the A button to set the minutes. Do the same for the date as well after you set the time. Both the AM and PM will light up, that is how you know you are setting the date. The top #'s are the month and the bottom are the days. If you press and hold the B button after it will flash so that the time displays every 15 minutes.
If you need to see the time in between displays just press A. Its a sturdy watch the strap is not hard or awkward and it fits my 10yr olds wrist that is small but has enough holes that a grown adult could wear it. I even bought one for myself. The only thing is the ones we received have red and orange lights not blue. I bought this watch on the 7th of August and received it on the 22nd. I included some pictures. The 1st picture is the time set at 1:08pm and the 2nd is the date at 8/22"
"Shipping was extremely fast, and the shoes were exactly as described."
"Love these, great support, this is my third pair."
I really love this shirt it has a fantastic length and it fits.
"My 4 year old son has been using this backpack for 5 months and it's holding up very well. No wear and tear at all. It's used for preschool, so nothing heavy has been placed in it, except for show & tell items. Normal use is for a folder and papers.

This is a full size backpack, so if you have older kids who like these characters then it would be good for them as well. Comes with a front zip pocket, and a main pocket."
"So cute and summery, fit as expected, super bright colors, soft top material, better details than a previous dress I got similar to this one, but this dress exceeded my expectation for the price, delivered in about a week, which was so fast."
I love the shoes and the colors are great. They are a little on the large side. I dhould have ordered a half size smaller. My bad.
Beautiful fabric. Crisp white is a welcome change from travel beige. Fits beautifully.
"I ordered a size x-l and they fit perfectly.  I am about 15 inches around my bicep area, 40 inches in the chest, 30 inches in the waist, and 42 inches in the butt area.  They actually fit me like a dress and I am 5'7.5.  They reached me to about mid thigh.  They are super cute, and my bf loves to see me in them.  Although, the material is a little bit thin, but I think it is perfect for Florida weather, especially during the winter when it is just a tad bit chilly.  Probably wouldn't be good for cold winters.  I love the designs, i ordered two different packs, and I'm thinking about ordering a third lol.  I actually haven't received any duplicates in color and design.  If it had the same design, it also came in a different color. I am thoroughly pleased.  I've worn and washed them in the machine about 7 times since ordering them lol and they still are holding up just fine, and haven't faded in color (but this also could be because I use clorox 2)."
I really like these boots.  I have wide calfs and have been unable to wear most boots advertised as wide calf.  These fit well over my calf but aren't too wide or gaping.  They are comfy and stylish and a good price.  Overall very pleased!
"My Wife Loves me, for  getting them for her."
I love the way they feel and they are just the right length
The shoes are comfortable for those of us who don't want to walk on spikes. I'm normally a 7 1/2 but ordered the 8. They are a bit snug but should be OK for the Christmas party I'll be attending
Good costume shoe. Not great arch support but still comfortable for several hours.
So far so good. Time will tell.
Casio watches are work horses .  These watches are built to last .  Very professional looking watch .  I receive many compliments on this watch from many people .
"I love the pattern, and they are so comfortable."
"Got this jacket in the mail today and couldn't be more thrilled! My daughter is 13 months and I debated between the 12-18 and the 18-24 month and so glad I got the 18-24! The sleeves are too long but rolling does not seem like a problem at all! It fits in the belly and is a great length! I'm glad it has a hood and has some of the water repellent material too! By ordering a little big, I'm hoping this carries us next spring too! Did I mention super adorable!"
"Fit as expected- very comfortable compared to other, more expensive steel toe sneakers. Would definitely recommend."
This is a beautiful bag. I got it in black and it's very pretty. It arrived quickly too. I do not know the durability of the bag because i just got it but i can say it looks very strong and pretty.
"I'm full on bottom and wide-set, and this fits great. It cuts in slightly under the arms, but that should go away once it's more worn in. Underwires do not dig in and the lace adds a great touch to an otherwise basic bra."
great buy good price fit excellent. shopping in store for 15' sneaker never get any selection. more that happy with these sneakers
Fit is is great. I went 1 size down as my kids are smaller for their age. Eg: got a 4t for my 5yr old.  Havent taken it skiing yet.. seems well made
Loved it but although we needed a mens size 9 we decided to exchange them for a 10.  Quality product.
"Beautiful sweatshirt. Durable, soft and slim fitting. Great buy!"
I got these to use for a costume for Walter from the Big Lebowski--they're perfect! Surprisingly good quality for the price.
"I do love these shoes.  When I first tried them on I thought ""oh these feel weird, I may need to return them"".  But I decided to give them try and wear them to work.  Turned out to be a great decision! After breaking them in for a day, they fit great, offer great support, I can wear them all day without issue.  Would not hesitate to purchase again.  Actually, getting a pair in the tan/brown color."
"I orden am x large because i read many reviews like it was smaller than a normal size so i order x large because my bf is large but it is actually xl, so order the right size."
These are a great quality for the price.  just a little tighter then expected.
Super see through. However with a slip underneath looks amazing and a half. Also looks great with work suit.
Lovely shoes. Love the way they look and fit
Beautiful shirt. I always get complements. worth it!!
I love Smartwool socks and have several pairs of them.  I expected these to be similar to their running socks however they are MUCH thicker!!!  I love the colors and the fit however they are tooo thick and warm to work out it.
Great fit and buy!
Beautiful sweater. One of my favorite sweaters of all time....  Fits true to size.
Love these shoes!! I have Plantar Fasictis (sp) and i'm glad I found these. Wish they came in more colors. Was a little leary about spending that kind of money but it's worth every penny!!
"These are great. I don't feel like I really have the right face shape for these, but they worked for a one-time wear for me! I'd recommend them.

"ALL clothing today seems to cheat a bit on waist size so that we don't feel fat.  Levi is no exception, as these are a bit larger than a true 33"".

My absolute favorite jeans from Amazon are the Calvin Klein men's straight leg in dark wash. They have a touch of spandex in the weave, are VERY comfortable and while also slightly larger than advertised look great and just feel right.  I bought a second pair of those in 32""."
Bought as Christmas for someone great purchase
Extremely comfortable and great for posture. My feet have never felt better!
"Best sunglasses for a baby, love this retro style! I used this brand for my boys when they were babies, too."
Very comfortable and supporitve. A sports bra that actually lifts and seperates. It's nice if you're well endowed to not have uniboob with a sports bra
"Love this model Dansko sandalsurprisingly light weight, sturdy and supportive. Great for making business casual look good."
Fashionable and light weight.
love it and wear it often.
"This handbag is absolutely gorgeous! I ordered it for my sister as a Christmas present. We are handbag snobs. Well, I'm the purse girl, she's the shoe girl. Kattee's bags are lovely. Substantial. So much room! Zippers, handles, and inside pockets are perfectly tailored. She is in law enforcement, and I wanted her to have something not only stylish but practical to carry file folders, MacBook, as well as her personal items. This bag filled all my requirements and more. It is beyond fabulous! I also purchased a matching wallet. I ALMOST did not give her these 2 Kattee items. Wanted them for myself! She called me, this Christmas morning, exclaiming her pleasure in receiving purse and wallet. First thing she said...""the smell of the leather is wonderful!"" Kattee delivered quickly. Received wallet first, then the handbag. Packaging is not fancy...but that's GREAT, because it allows pricing to be very favorable to the consumer. (sorry, didn't take photos before wrapping and sending to new owner). I will be buying many more items from Kattee!!"
"OK, so they look like they were made from recycled tractor tires, but they make up for it in comfort and stature. This is my third pair of shoes constructed in this manner and they are great. In my opinion the Sketchers brand is the best. If you have very narrow feet, plan on wearing socks.
Well worth the money -- and on Amazon you usually pay less than retail."
It fits well and very soft.
"A friend of mine had these boots in a teal color so I ordered them. They are so wonderful that I wear them every day. There is arch support, they are stylish and as a teacher, I am standing and walking all day long, so they are extremely comfortable."
"I love them, they are perfect for the colder weather times"
"My cousin couldn't decide what to wear to a fancy event we were going to and asked me to pick a dress for her. I ordered about 6 different dresses and this was the undisputed winner. She LOVED it! Its just as pictured. For sizing purposes, she's about a size 10."
"WARNING! This applies to the bright yellow shirt ONLY. It is incorrectly marked 2XL when it is actually a LONG. I have multiple shirts from this manufacturer - all of them perfect size. I marked the ""Fit As Expected"" box because it IS a 2XL, just extra long. If you ARE a 2XL - Long, this one's for YOU!"
I have a problem with my left foot that I didn't think these would bother. I need the shoe to be completely flat--no bumps/ridges inside the foot bed or pressing from sides. Oddly the ridge of the shoe between the ball of the foot and the toes is really uncomfortable for that left foot. The right foot (tiny bit smaller than left) fits as usual and the shoe feels just fine. Others who may also be looking for shoes that are completely flat inside may not find these comfortable.
"Daughters loved it, fit just right. She got an xl."
Bought it for my nephew. It fitted perfectly. Product alike the photo
"Shirt runs a little small but love the light, relaxed feel of it. I get hot easy in the summer and really appreciate comfortable light weight clothing. So will see how it holds up after multiple washings but for now buy a size up and enjoy. I ordered 2 more after wearing it once. Hopefully these will wear the same."
"These earring are very pretty and the stones are very shiny.  I definitely felt that the gold was a rose gold and not yellow as some reviewers said.  The one issue which you can tell a bit from the picture is that the stone DOES stick out quite a bit from the ear so that is a flaw in the design especially if you have long hair.

The other issue mentioned by other reviewers that I do agree with is that the posts are ""soft.""  They bend very, very easily -- even by accident.

However, if you are careful, I think these are very nice for an evening out!"
This is a really nice sock that I purchased as a gift for a friend of mine.  She really likes the socks and they fit very well.  Highly recommend these for all softball players.
"Shoes get compliments from time to time.  Very nice/good looking casual shoe.

Comfortable to walk in for longer distances (couple miles).  Definitely would recommend."
Order for my mother. She really like these (Cat Eyes) glasses.
I got the 1ct and they're the perfect size for my ears. I have very sensitive ears and haven't had earrings in my ears for over 2 years...I put these in and my ears were red for only about 10 min! I'm happy I finally found a pair of earrings that I can actually wear with out having any allergic reaction! And the price... you can't beat it!
"Fitted and beautiful with the lace bottom & top, love it under many tops."
"This is a good looking watch, Very comfortable to wear,good size and very easy to read. Looks more expensive than it is. For the money you can not go wrong"
"These sandals are light weight, sturdy, and comfortable. The real deal"
"great scarf. warm, attractive and soft"
"My grandson loves his new sneakers. He has a wide foot and it is hard to get wide sneakers. The length is fine. As he wears them, they stretch a little in the width, so they are alright. He loves that they light up!"
"Great quality and the case it came with was a great added touch. I gave this as a gift and it was well received.

The case made it even mor unique."
"The shirt fits very well, and it wasn't tight around the shoulder area..."
As described and delivered in a timely manner.
I love these boots - I can wear them all day.
"I had this ring for about 4 months! Not a scratch ! Is beautiful! I had many complements on it, is simple and shines ! I really recommend this ring!"
very lovely boots
"i got these for training days, otherwise i live in my minimals.  These worked so well, keeping my foot where it needs to be and no slipping."
These look really nice and match my wife's engagement ring perfectly. Seem to be well made and long-lasting.
"Loved this dress!! So cute, and flattering. I thought it was a little matronly for me, so I returned it, but all around a great idea to hide that stubborn pouch!"
"nice light coat, great value"
"HAPPY WIFE, HAPPY LIFE! THEY ARE GLUED TO HER FEET FROM THE TIME SHE GETS HOME FROM WORK UNTIL SHE GOES TO BED. VERY WELL MADE AND GREAT PRICE."
"Beautiful, incredibly soft blouse.  Fits nicely, but not too tight.  Perfect for wearing as is or underneath sweater during winter months.  Very happy with this blouse."
These heels are exactly like the picture. Fits perfectly and so very light weighted! I love them!
"very pretty, looks just like the picture"
"Nice shoes but returned. Indecisive. Might order again though. Really like Rockports, these have non slip sole."
"Love this ring! Looks very cool. Wish they offered smaller sizes, however. I like wearing it in my middle finger which is size 6 so size 7 in that finger is fairly loose but still manageable."
Sleeves to long but well made
"I have had the shoes for one week and so far I really love them. They fit comfortably and look super cute. I wouldn't want to spend all day in them as they seem like they could easily create a blister, but so far great purchase at a great price."
"I would hate to see how this shoe looks in the ""non-wide"" size. They are pretty narrow. I will be returning them, since they seem on the small side. However, I'm planning on just getting the next size up. These shoes are pretty nice. They are very cushy (if that's even a word?) Lets just call them soft. And I like the way they look. Just a little annoyed that they are so small. But I guess that I should have paid better attention to the reviews."
Great boots. Super comfortable and look really good. Well worth the money
"purchased this watch on my boss' behalf for her nephew, Blanket ;)  i'm sure he loves it."
"I used this as a flower girl dress, it fit perfect and was so cute. I recommend ivory over white, it has a nice suddle shine"
"This poncho is like the hoodies we used to purchase years ago down in California. They are warm, quite sturdy and should last for a long time."
"highly recommended! They fit perfectly , fery comfortable and snug rain boots , i gifted them to my friend and he is utterly contented with  gift  !"
Like it. No problems with quality as others have stated
Makes me feel so good!
VERY thin. Comfortable
These are my daughter's favorite softball pants. Great fit and quality and I like that they're easy to clean.
Best watch I've owned in a while. Thinking about one for my granddaughter who's in the Navy.
Made very well and look GREAT!!!
"My physical therapist recommended this shoe to help with my coordination.  Needlesly to say, I wear them everywhere and my coordination has greatly improved."
i love the black and white chevron image and when I saw this bag i had to order it. the size is great for someone like me who like to just throw stuff in and go.
"I tried these in the red in my usual sanita sandal size of 40.  Too long.  The length in the 39 is much better for my narrower than average, size 9 foot.  The adjust-ability of all straps is perfect.  Comfy sole.  Hope they wear well next summer.  I wear a 41 in Sanita, closed back clogs for work. The sizing discrepancies can be challenging."
"Beautiful,  excellent quality"
Delivered after 3 days although I was expecting it to arrive later. Im so surprised with the quality... sooooo good! Thick and it doesnt smell bad. Nice fit. I think Ill buy other colors too.
Love these jeans.  I have trouble finding jeans that fit at my waist and not sit too low.  Found a pair of these. Love them.  Wanted more and found these at a great price!
I received this ring right away. It is more beautiful in person than even the picture. The metal is thick and sturdy and crafted very well. I ordered a size 5 and it was true to size. I am very pleased with my purchase and the value. Good price for a great ring. Recommended.
Happy about this purchase. I'll probably order different other colours. I usually wear a size 10 but i ordered 9 (in faith cuz there was no 10 available) and surprisingly it fits adequately.
"Good comfortable shoe, lots of support(heel and arch). Fast delivery, quality product. The sole maybe a little slippery on  smooth surfaces(wet or oily) due to the design so watch your step!"
I love these sandals and want them in other colors... if the price drops I will totally get them :) They are very comfy and cute and also work for my business casual dress code without having a heel.  Arch support is pretty good and I have extremely high arches so it's important. Also no break in time needed... I had no blisters from these. Had many compliments on these sandals!
I use them
Huge Marvel fan here! These boots are too cute and too perfect! I love them!
"This is the first time I'm buying Uggs on Amazon, and I was somewhat nervous. HOWEVER, I'm very impressed with the fast delivery and perfect condition of the Green Bailey Mariko boots I received.

They are AUTHENTIC! I scanned the label with my QR reader app and it confirmed it. I'm not sure who the retailer it shipped from was, but they definitely get a 5 star rating!

Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size. I'm a 7.5, and can wear anything between a 6 (in the classic short) to a 7 with ease.

Only the 8 was available and that turned out to be too large :( Another reviewer stated she has wide feet so she ordered up and they fit her perfectly."
Very comfortable.  I'd forgotten how good my feet could feel wearing this brand.  Very supportive.
Like look and price.
"Leather hard wearing, slightly a little"
Perfect Kathy S
elegant and sporty
I gained some weight and plan on losing it and didn't want to pay 82 dollars for the Wacoal I usually wear and have several of that are snug right now. So I opted to try this. I'm absolutely thrilled! It's actually more comfortable without the underwire like my go to bra has. I wear about a 40C and the XL fit me perfectly without being too snug in the bodice. I absolutely love it! I think I found a new go to!!
"It is SO difficult for me to find bras that fit properly and provide the right support for my FF ladies, but this bra is absolutely perfect. I love that it is pretty, too (usually larger bras are made in ""old lady"" colors and aren't cute at all). I've had this bra for a few months now and it's holding up great."
"Usually Disney clothing runs a little small, but this was big. My average size almost 4 year old had to go down to a 3T and it's still big."
"Now that I have the correct size, I LOVE this shoe for running! I originally purchased the 10.5 and had to return it for the 11.0."
"I paid full price for this and did not get a discount to review it.
This necklace rocks!! It is so beautiful. The only thing is that it tangles super easy so I leave it hanging when I am not wearing it.
I have gotten so many complements on it. I am a small person (100 lbs) so this is fun without being overwhelming.
It is lightweight and very comfortable to wear. I got the silver and may go see if I can find it in gold.
It looks great with a sleeveless sundress and will be so cute with a sweater in the winter.
It is long and the pics are spot on as far as how it looks.
I looked it over really well when I first got it and did not find any spots that I had to fix or tighten. The neck did not close as tight as I wanted it to. I just added a jump ring on the collar and problem solved. I made it into a true choker. You don't need to do that- I just thought it looked better that way.
The collar is kinda neat as it has ribbon woven into the chain.
I think this is a good, solid piece that will last me several seasons. If something does happen to it, it is easy enough to add a ring here or there or close off a loop.
You just have to be care and not get it caught on anything. I would not wear it around a baby or a dog that likes to jump up on you."
"I got these and I like them alot, desipe the fact that the small round metal conch on the ankle came off one of one of my boots (it's just decorative and it doesn't bother me) within a week of me wearing them. The boots fit correct to size and are comfortable. The boot fits snuggly to the calf which makes them more comfortable to wear with skinny jeans or leggings or with jeans worn over them with makes them look like normal cowboy boots."
"These are some nice jeans, fit like a glove very comfortable."
"A gift for my husband. The fit was excellent as when we read the reviews, we understood these shoes had to be broken into. Nice sturdy shoes, thick his quality material and worth every penny."
They look good and they are comfortable. a little too narrow.
"High quality.  Soft leather, but strong throughout."
"Great shoes. Love the fact that they support my weight lifting better, but still let me better my running. Also that neon green strap on the back comes in REALLY handy when I can clip these to a backpack and take them with me on the run or whatever. These shoes are solid and more then what I expected when ordering!"
"I LOVE these boots! They are comfortable and fit like other J-41 shoes that I have and I have gotten tons of compliments on them. They have a low sole and good tread with a minimal inner fuzzy lining, with a little extra room for thick socks. They are not completely waterproof so I have to be careful around puddles, which is why I gave them four stars instead of five."
"I have a few citizen watches and am now used to have a great watch every time I buy one of these gems.
This one is no different, great quality, keeps good time and is confortable to wear.

As a young boy i received my first citizen watch from my grandmother and got used to see them as great time machines. This opinion has never changed since they do make great watches at a affordable enough price and stand as one of the best price/quality makes in watchmaking and as i said, this black eagle skyhawk is no different. :)

Solar powered ( Ecodrive ) is a must in dive watches ( i have two citizen Ecodrive dive watches and both are outstanding ) and altough this is not a dive watch ( i don't even intend to go swimming with it ), solar powered means you don't need to change batteries. Sun is always shinning in Portugal so battery is always full :)

It's relatively simple to use, has enough features so it will keep you entertained for a long time and has plenty of time zones, should you need to travel. I withdrew most of them so that the menu doesn't show all those cities but you can go back anytime and recover them.
It's not the easiest watch to work with but also not the most complicated i have. So it's fun to have it.

The only least good points are the lack of a backlight but i already knew this before buying it ( maybe the new skyhawks with backlight could appeal more to all those who need backlight ) and also it's just a little big heavier than it should ( stainless steel ),that is, comparing with a Tissot T-touch which is all titanium and rubber strap. Both are the most confortable watches to wear, very very nice indeed.
However, it's not a heavy watch, just a bit heavier than it should?!?

Amazon US is great indeed, fast delivery, good packaging, all in all a great service. All watches ordered from them arrived in fine condition. Had bought from them before, expecting another watch from them right now :)

Thanks to our mate M_ ""Agent Of Fortune"". Loved your video review, nice music and if you take a look at his video, you'll get a close idea what to expect from this watch. :)"
"Very comfortable and more supportive than regular undies, though not as supportive as the UFM ones I bought multiple of (they have a drawstring that, well, you know).  These feel a tiny bit large when new, but once washed and laid out to dry (not run through the dryer), they fit as expected.  I'm glad I discovered them, as they help with pain that is from nerve issues from a multi-impact auto accident."
We had one but it broke. Will keep the broken  one just in case this one doesn't come with all the accessories shown like clothes or the plush teddy bear
"I purchased this wig for an early halloween party this year. I dressed as an 80's themed guy. Wore Old Navy colorful flip flops, bright short shorts, a bright colored Jaws shirt, shutter glasses & wayfarer (switched between both), grew out a mustache, and got this wig!  The wig came in a plastic container and the wig itself was in a string net bag, which was great because it keeps it together for storage purposes. The wigs base fit great on my head, which tends to be a little larger. I usually wear L/XL hats, but it would easily fit a smaller head, since the base part is stretchy. The hair looks real and I am happy with the purchase. I receive a lot of compliments. The only downside is the tone of brown. I have closer to blonde brown facial hair. The wig is exactly what the picture shows and is a darker brown color. I highly recommend this wig to anyone looking for a costume accessory."
I really enjoy darn tough socks. Ive had pairs that have lasted for years. Really like how the heel in this type fits
Nice double layer cushion on bottoms and toes.
"I love argyle and the red, black and white combo.  The only drawback is that it's polyester and I don't normally buy polyester but I like it so much that I don't care.  I am 5 ft 2 inches, 36 D, hourglass figure and I bought the medium."
"I have been on the Victoria secret wagon for the longest time.... Until I found this. The reason I started looking for other bra was because the wire in VS causes my skin to hyper pigment in areas of pressure. This fits so perfect, it's fits along the natural curves of body without pushing or squishing. Great. I have already brought other colors."
Perfect for what I need it for.  Love the snip off hem.  It was too long and I could snip it to the length needed
Great fit!  Very flattering!  Great material!  Very highly recommended it!
Very pleased - nice shoe
"Great basic ribbed tank.  I'm 5' 10"" and it comes past my bottom (but not much farther!). I use it for layering and over leggings."
Wife says they are warm & comfortable. She loves the memory form! Wore them to church
"These are very well made they fit me tight on the thighs. I bought a large cause my thighs are big, I'm 5'6"" and they were a bit too long so they crumble at the ankles but that seems to be how all leggings for me so eh. I like how vivid they are and how the design doesn't warp at the thighs from the tightness. I would buy again."
My wife really likes these shoes.  She is advised not to wear them on wet days.  The sole doesn't provide traction like ordinary sneakers
"This IL Caldo Mens Flat Top Hat Adjustable Army Sun Hats Baseball Cap Tripper Newsboy Cap is super adorable on my son.  I like that it is adjustable, so it fits his pre-teen sized head perfectly.  The hat seems well made and has already endured a few different wearings.

The style and coloring of this hat makes it super versatile and can be worn casually or dressed up a little more.  My son has had a great time already planning when he is going to wear this hat next.

I had the opportunity to purchase this product at discount in exchange for my honest review after use, and I am glad that I did.  This is not a product I would normally try on an impulse, but I am now a huge fan of it and will probably be purchasing again in the future.  I cant wait to try some of the different scents/formulas. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own. I work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item. While it is true that many items are received at discounted rates or complimentary, my reviews are completely honest and are my personal experiences with the product. Again, it is just my opinion, your own opinion might vary. I received no monetary compensation and am not required to give a good review."
Made for woman I love my boots. They look and feel sexy. Worth every penny. My daughter want a pair. I think I'm buying another pair just to put up for keep sake. Thank you for a great pair of boots. 
Love this dress!! I'll be buying in more colors
Long lasting stylish
"I was looking for a pair of beaters not made by the Luxottica brands and found this. It is surprisingly well made for the price with metal arms, snappy hinges, and a good looking tortoise pattern frame."
Very beautiful and quality piece! I can wear this with several different outfits! Would definitely recommend!
"Ordering a half size larger was perfect. I will mention the photo looks like bright orange detail, but it's more of a pink tinted salmon. But, it looks great."
"The size hurts because that's how big I've gotten.  However, they are comfortable."
Love this boot!! My only complaint is that they don't have a size 11-12 so I had to order them bigger. My daughter didn't wait to grow into them. They are comfy and soft and seem to be holding up to her abuse.
good quality leather.  arrived quickly.
"Fantastic pants. Sexy too. Many compliments by men! I love these pants! I am 5'6"" and a sm.in all pants. Even did Zumba in them. Also wore with platform shoes."
No surprises. I just hate the v-neck t-shirts. Just wanted some classic plain white undershirts and got exactly what I wanted for a pretty good price.
"The sizing provided on the Ann Chery isn't correct. I would have accidentally ordered a size XL when I needed a M. After reading reviews I choose the medium and it fit perfectly. I started on the first hook today and can't wait to see the results in a week.

Please see the photo of the sizing chart based on your height and weight which is what I used to get the best measurements.

TIP: Also ladies with a shorter torso may prefer to use the two hook as the three hooks are better for longer torsos."
"Very nice material, but seems to run a bit small.  I have another seersucker shirt by Woolrich of the same size, with a very slight difference in style that fits perfectly, so I was a bit disappointed with this new shirt."
"The boots were nice, but order a size bigger."
Loving this vest
"Very pleased with this product.  Decided to return for a 3T, so he can wear it throughout all of fall/winter."
Great color and detail and they give you plenty of room and length.  I also like the great variety of interesting designs.
I love it! Fits and also comfortable. I love the colors of this shoe. I'm glad that I have it.
"The bikini is super cute and love the color. The top fits great but the bottom is to big but in a wierd way it's like baggy in wierd areas and not sonflstterin me but considering the price I kept it and will work with it. Nice quality . 5""8"" 135 the suit is a M I think"
"These boot are good, added some insoles and they are very comfortable, I just hope they can withstand my daily job duties."
"My first wire-free and I love it! This is a very comfortable bra and well-made. I can even wear t-shirts and look smooth. This particular model has just a slight bit of discrete padding at the bottom of the cup which gives you just enough lift without looking all pushed up. I did try the one without this little bit of padding and did not like the fit - it is also called Elements of Bliss, so if you want the lift, make sure you get the correct model number 1298. I also have ""side boobs"" and this bra accommodates for that. My bra for years has been an underwire Calvin Klein, 36C, but in this Elements of Bliss bra I found a 38B to be the better fit."
"Great tailoring, the right size, the fall can be worn, the price is a little high, dark blue, always good"
"Love these, they fit perfect and keep my belly fat in place, specially during zumba classes "
"The fabric is faded in some areas, but I don't mind. It kind of looks a little worn, like new worn jeans. I like it and I'm going to keep it. It's a great shape and great fit."
THESE THINGS ARE SO COMFORTABLE.
"thin material, but for the price is very good"
"Very cute! My daughter loves the headband, but isn't a huge fan of the tail. We bought it for the headband anyway :)"
My grandson loves the fit and softness of the shirt.
A great tshirt - I like the grey color and the slightly emblem looks perfect. The material is a thicker cotton and after several washes I have noticed no shrinkage!  It's my go to shirt now - May the Force Be With You!
These are the best slippers I have ever owned! I love them and want more!
My Timberland shoes are very comfortable. Great price!
Absolutely great fit and execellent service
"Love these. Sizing was perfect. They are cute. Paired with strappy heels and cute shirt... looks awesome. I'm 5'1"" 140lbs. I ordered a 10 and they fit perfect."
"My husband and I started buying Puma shoes a few years ago and have never went back. These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, and I get a lot of compliments on them.  I don't use them for running, so I'm not sure on their performance, but they work for my day to day shoe."
I bought this as an Amazon lightening deal for my little sister (12yo) for Christmas. It is beautiful and appears to be durable enough for a busy swimmer and dancer to wear regularly! If you are running out of ideas for a pre-teen girl I would highly recommend a simple piece of bling like this Swarovski Crystal Star Necklace!
"Not as substancial as I thought it would be, it's a smaller piece and thus I wear it little."
"ive had them for 2 years and with proper care they can last. I would recommend applying a water proofer when you first get them and also to go gentle on the zipper. I am a size 7.5 and ordered 7.5 and they fit perfectly. You can even wear thick or slim socks with them.
I have the brown pair and love them! durable yet still comfy!"
Very cute love them. They aren't top quality but what do you expect for such a low price. Shipping was quick and on time.
Longer than I like.
"Bought for my daughter, she loves them."
"These are the most adorable boots and are comfy.  The boots are a tiny bit shorter than the usual size 10 shoes or boots I wear, but they are still fine.  They look cute with jeans and the lining is also appealing with its gray pattern.  Teva makes a fashionable and well-crafted product.  The grid on the boot sole is excellent and provides good traction on snow and ice."
This outfit is adorable. It had sequins which I didn't notice initially but it makes it even cuter. I'm excited to give this as a birthday present.  Will make a cute addition to the fall wardrobe.
we read on a different comment that the shoe runs big. So i ordered  a complete size down My son usually wears a 6 so i ordered a 5! Beautiful shoe
Use to wear these as a little girl. Never thought I'd be wearing one again. No problem with fitting. Perfect length for my dress.
"Bought these for my son for Christmas.  They fit perfectly, look great, and he loves them.  I would definitely order again."
Great set of tanks.  Super soft and not too clingy.  I'm going to order more!
"My little guy is so very much into Lego's Ninjago as of late. He wanted to be nothing but the blue ninja for Halloween this year, and he is very observant to the extent that if we had purchased any blue ninja costume, he would have noticed there are no ropes across the chest like on his Lego figure.

I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive at first about purchasing a costume online as I assumed the photographer would have made the costume look much better in the picture than it is in real life. However, this costume proved to be an exception to the rule, and looked much better on my three-year-old than in the photo.

Pros:
-Warm enough material for Halloween night
-Multiple use (he uses it now for playing)
-Cost effective
-Aesthetics

Cons:
None."
"Great fit, great price!  Will do business with again! A++++++ ! :)"
"I am glad I went with this instead of T.U.K. I know it may be better in the long run, but for paying essentially half the price, I think these shoes are great! The quality seems fine and they fit well, and look just as nice as the T.U.K. brand. I have been admiring these kind of shoes when paired with outfits for quite some time now, so I'm glad I got them!"
"Excellent shoes, bought a second pair."
I purchased these for my wife.  She uses them in the winter months for bed.  My wife said they are very comfortable and they fit well.  They have also handled several washes without fading or falling apart.
"I used it to reattach the liner of my favorite pair of ballet flats. I had worn them so much that the liner was peeling off by the toes. I used this product to fix it and they are good as new! I was worried that the glue would dry lumpy and be uncomfortable on my feet but it dried very flat and smooth. Plus, a little product goes a long way, I will be using this tube for a while."
Very sexy the only problem is cups are small for me I am 36 inches n I ordered small but still looks awesome!
This backpack is great. Lots of small pockets and large pockets with easy access. Places to attach additional containers. Even has a rain resistant cover.
Perfect for my 80's night out. Nice and long for lots of scrunching. True to color.
I plan to wear these as my house slippers. So far so good!
I have an 11 1/2 shoe size so I ordered the XL size which is for a 11-12. When I put them on they were pretty snug! I hope they stretch out! Other than that they are excellent!
Great ! Received multiple compliments. I ordered another pair !
Warm fun
"Great price, too!  I wish it were a little more heavy, but super cute and fits snuggly under my helmet!"
Perfect except the strap comes off easily. I pinched the clasp together firmly and it's all good now. It holds all my essentials and can grab and go!
"Love the boots, only draw back I can say is the logo is somewhat invisible. Wish it was a bit bolder or in a contrasting color. Overall great fit and really comfortable."
"The dress is very well made and will withstand repeated washing's. The size chart is accurate with plenty of extra room in the waist. I added an extra petticoat to fill out the full skirt a little more, but it's not necessary. Well worth the price."
"These are pretty comfortable heels, my go to when i need to wear heels but for a good while, I can withstand them longer than most of my heels, definitely a great buy, i plan to get them in other colors"
Great color fit and feel
"This bra is surprisingly supportive!! pre-pregnancy, I use to run half and full marathons (albeit in 3+ sports bras), so I am difficult to please, Now I would not go running in this bra while I am breastfeeding, but it is the most supportive and comfortable nursing bra I have found. I am a 34F while BFing and I ordered the medium, which is a bit snug cup-wise BUT not so tight that you get plugged ducts. I am super happy I finally found this bra and will likely get a few more!"
Nice 100% cotton. I use it for sleeping.
"I work in the Garden and Landscaping industry, and depending on the season can wear a pair of boots up to 60 hours a week, in all weather conditions. Comfort and durability are my top concerns when purchasing work boots.

The reasons I decided on this pair:
 1) I've worn the Timberland Titan Soft Toe in the past, and was impressed by the comfort from day one
 2) I really wanted something with a safety toe which can be difficult to find for women
 3) The soles on my previous boots always wore out first, so I was looking for something rugged

Point 1. I don't know if the Rigmaster has a different insole from the Titan or if Timberland changed things up in the year since my last purchase, but this was not nearly as cushy as my Titans. I've since changed the insole 3 times trying to get that same level of comfort I used to have, especially since I spend the vast majority of my day walking on concrete, which is murder on feet.

Point 2. The safety toe is impressive. I can move freely without having to think about safely positioning my feet all the time. It is slightly different in feel from the soft toe Titans since the boot can't ""smush"" over time as the leather gets broken in, but is by no means uncomfortable and the same sporty socks I wore previously still fit well inside the boot.

Point 3. The thicker, more rugged sole definitely takes some getting used to, since it adds both height and weight. My legs and feet were tired for the first few days from the weight, and I banged the edges into the stair's risers due to the extra height. Once I got used to them I was very impressed that the treads added extra traction on wet concrete without also getting a lot of gravel stuck in them (one of the reasons I'd liked the Titans' soles was the impossibility of always getting gravel wedged in the treads).

All in all, a very nice pair of boots. And in my job, the waterproof upper was a must and that holds true in this pair as well as the Titans. I do try to oil the leather several times a year, and don't keep them much longer than 12 to 16 months as that seems to be the life expectancy of both the arch support and the soles. My main complaint is the factory insole; my previous Titans were as comfortable as slippers from the first wear, and these have never quite matched that. I wonder if the heavy duty outer soles play in role in that as well? The lacings are also comfortable. I've never experienced any tightness or pinching at the ankle."
"The top is somewhat small, but fits for now, and she's pretty petite..."
Best panties I have found for my toddler.  Hold up great and way softer than the cheap character panties you see at stores everywhere.
Love these! i bought them thinking they were bigger but really i liked the actual smaller size. They are so light and comfortable. yet still stylish.
"Love the outside pocket for laptop. I can also put away a book, map, and other paperwork in it with ease to avoid carrying them in my purse especially going in and out the airport. Perfect for a few-day's business trip. Sturdy, easy to roll, great colors (I bought blue and my mom purple)."
This shoe was immediately comfortable and wearable. Really well made and a good value.
"I really like this cardigan. It fits really well, initially I wasn't sure about the sizing so I went up a size. I ordered another one in red, and I plan on getting more colors."
very pretty nursing bra! fits as expected
I love this coat!  It is surprisingly warm for how lightweight it is.  I just wanted a coat that wasn't so bulky and heavy and this one is perfect.  So glad I purchased it!
"I looked all over for these and finally bought them off amazon.  WalMart used to carry them but no longer does.  They are lovely material, with a cotton crotch.  They really are pretty, and the high cut legs make them feel good and not ride up.  It's hard to find size 10 underwear that looks pretty and not just like a giant old lady brief.  These are as nice as I've found.  My only complaint is about the listing.  They are very unclear on what you will get.... you can pick 'assorted' or 'wardrobe'.  What does that mean?  I bought one of each and still have no idea.  I wish they would list individual packets so you could pick some colors!  I finally went to the Hanes store at the outlet mall and bought some there.  No cheaper than amazon, but at least I could see what I was getting.  I still can't find the lovely dark jewel-tone colors WalMart used to carry.  These are all mostly cream, brown and one patterned in each package.  Oh, and one time I got an all-black 3 pack.  (I've bought these from amazon several times.)  But they are definitely comfy, pretty and nice!"
A lil small but I love it
"3rd pair I've purchased from Amazon, I'm on my feet all day and they don't make my feet sore."
Love the heel on these. What a shame they aren't leather but the price was terrific.
"Great bra. I have always had trouble finding front closure bras.  This is reasonably priced and very comfortable, and  I highly reccomend it."
"Cute, but I don't get much use out of it"
The vest fits me perfect!!!!! I am kinda big and husky on the upper body and to be safe I ordered the largest size (5X because I read other reviews that this runs a size or two small) and it fits me perfectly!!! I am apart of the luxury transportation business and proper attire was a must!! I will be ordering more!!!
"Just a quick review, These pants are very nice and I like the feel of it but these aren't slim fit. so, if you are in slim fit pants these aren't for you, I am giving four start because shipment was on time, it feels nice."
"This is the 4th pair of the Bluma Ballerina flats I have bought, they are comfortable for my miserable feet. I can wear them all day for the most part.
I love them in black, and this one in white and pewter is very nice, but be aware they are a bit shiny. Definitely cute though."
"I now have 3 pairs of these.  Each pair fit well.  I usually wear a 7 1/2, but order a 7.  My feet are not wide.  If wide, may need to order up?  I receive many compliments and they are very comfortable."
Love these cozy little booties for my 7 week old daughter. She has worn them several times since birth and hopefully they will fit her for a few more weeks. They are perfect for keeping her feet warm and snugly when we go out during the cold winter months (in Australia). Highly recommend for any winter babies.
"I was in a pinch after breaking my right ankle and left knee. I am in a full leg brace on my left leg and a boot on my right. I really needed an option to keep my legs warm and still be able to use the restroom. It is very hard with a leg that is stuck straight. These socks are the BEST... They fit great and are very warm. I purchased many different thigh high socks from Amazon as I could not get to a store. These are my favorite. Others don't go high enough or are to tight on my thigh.
I am 5'8"" 135lbs. i will use these after these braces are off to keep my legs warm in the winter for years to come."
"The only thing I would change, is to have the strap at the top of the shoulder widen out a little and have a little padding."
Make sure you order your right size. I like this better than the ones I had before since this is a thinner. It does not bother me as much as the ones which are thick. I ordered a size bigger which fits but not perfect. In spite of that it still works and does not fall or anything. It is perfect for people who lift and workout since it is flexible and conforms to the bar. Also for those who are allergic to metals and such. I have a titanium ring which I rarely ware because it bothers me. But this one really does it job in reminding me and the people around that I am married and not looking. I am happy to be able to receive a complimentary sample for evaluation so I can provide with an honest and equitable review in return.
"This is such a beautiful necklace. Granted I only got it yesterday, but it really looks great and looks well made. It's bigger than I expected, which is fine with me, I love things like that."
"Good jacket, cuts the wind and fits a bit tighter than expected.  Zippers could be a heavier duty, and the collar with the hood in it is a joke.  Zip the collar hood off and store it in the back lumbar pocket if you think you will ever actually use it.  After a couple of months with the jacket I used the hood twice this winter, it was a good fit and helped with wind on the sledding slope.  My biggest gripe is the zippers lightweight and too fine toothed especially the main zipper.  Frankly its a lightweight jacket that cuts wind and rain well, but probably isn't up to running through brush or crawling through a lot of mud and dirt on a regular basis.  Around town its great and I like not having brand advertising on my clothes too."
"Like most women, I discovered that I was wearing the wrong size bra. I decided to try a DD in this and it is a perfect fit. The U-back is a godsend. No more struggling, tugging and rearranging.  I have ordered 3 of these and am getting a 4th.  It's very nice to have color and pattern options in a DD. The support is excellent for me and the shaping looks great under a t-shirt. Try one."
I love these socks - they are awesome. But I have a size 10 1/2 -11 shoe so they are a tiny bit small on me. This is nothing new for us large feeted women though - the socks are awesome.
"I was concerned about buying this shirt. I have a hard time finding my size in colors other than white, pale blue, or dark gray. I am pleased! I'll be buying more of these shirts in their colors."
"Very pleased with this, very sexy - tough to get on but once on... staying on and look great with a costume."
"LOVE this bra!!!  This is the first underwire bra that I can say I like.  The underwire is cushioned so that it does not mark the skin and the bra has a good hold.  I do some light jogging and do not have to wear two bras.  Of course, if I were to do heavy exercise, I would.  This bra is also true to size."
"I love this tank top and get so many compliments on it. I'm about 200 lbs and this fits just fine, not tight at all.
Great summer addition for summer attire."
Love this bag.  Very good quality and holds tons of stuff
Beautiful necklace friend who loves sharks loved it.
So comfortable!!! I wore these to a wedding that I was maid of honor in. I wore them for hours and hours and my feet didn't hurt. I never wear heels/wedges so I was worried. I did need to put bandaids on the back of my heels because my skin started to rub a bit with the back of the shoes.
Fits Perfect! I've purchased a few PattyBoutik products. They are made well and fit nicely.
I like it. Well make and not too big and gaudy.
Love this top and it fits well!
"I love my other Goddess bras but they all have lines across the bust that are very unattractive. I am a 36G so I need a proper fit to spare my upper back shoulders and neck. This fits great, smooth under my t-shirt and the elastic shoulder straps stay in place."
I bought a few and some were better quality than others.
"I like the shirts, no tags, nice and soft... the only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that they shrunk length-wise. So now they look very wide and not as long. My daughter is tall and skinny, so the last thing I wanted was for the shirts to get shorter, but it still works. She wears 5T and the size S works for her right now."
"These shoes are great.  They are made well, look great and are comfortable."
Great quality shirt for a very reasonable price.
Nice product.  Wife likes how it fits me.
"In everything else I wear a size XL now, so I thought a large would be tighter than it was. These are the size that larges used to be before people started getting their feelings hurt if they weren't classified as a medium."
I love it. Anything sterling silver I like an awful lot
"This is a beautifully crafted genuine leather bag, it is the perfect size to carry all of my ""necessary"" stuff!! I love it!! Excellent quality, excellent price, and super fast shipping!!"
Great fit only thing I'd suggest is double the knees and thighs with material
These boots are awesome .. They are actually warm .. A bit heavy and I went with review I'm size 7 but bought an 8 its a Lil big but w thick socks fits perfect .. Sole made my feet hurt in beginning but Noe foot used to it .. The pink is soft and nice color gets dirty very easy
Cheap but durable.
i love just about anything skull related. the actual quality isn't the greatest but for the price i couldn't pass this by. a few drops of super glue behind the eye and the bullet to ensure they are secure was all that was truly needed. love the design. love the look. it is definitely a conversation peice.
Makes skin soft and smells great.
Very comfortable and can dress up or dress down :)
"Perfect, very easy to customize."
These feel so great you tend to forget that you have other shoes! They're also nice looking. Give them a try.
Men's shoe size 9. They're cotton and they will shrink in that first wash. These fit my size 9 perfect AFTER the wash.
Just what I was looking for & the fit was just right even after the dryer! I would buy more if they had other colors that worked for me.
"The pants were a good length and the fabric is brushed inside - good for winter wear.  The size was a bit too small to be comfortable, so I will be returning them.  My hips are on the higher side of a size 10, so it's always a gamble when I order or try on pants in the store.  I'm afraid the large would be too large. I wish I could keep them since the quality seems excellent for the price.  I especially like the pockets, the opening of which is rounded out on the front.  It appears they would not gape like many pockets do when just inserted in the seam.  I also like the fact that the elastic waistband is tapered for a better fit."
"I like it so far.  Looks like another brand.  Don't confuse ""Alpine Swiss"" with Swiss Army"
"I'm about 5,6 tall & weigh about 180, so i got the 2x. Its fits great, perfectly tight, without being to tight & still looking good, and i only say tight because of the slip under it, the long wavy outside covers any possible tight look from the slip inside. Its very comfortable, not to short either it just covers my knees which i like, I absolutely love the cuts in the back and arms. I bought this dress to wear to a wedding with some white stockings and a white hair piece. So far i got no complaints, the package showed up within about 5 days of ordering and in great condition."
"these shoes are soo comfortable, I am on my feet all day, they have not hurt my feet from the moment I put them on. Had one pair already this is my second."
"Great shirt, very soft, clean white, not too sheer.  Purchased a juniors size small for 5'4, 98 pound and it was snug.  Will definitely keep - but in the next size up."
I bought these cubes for my sister whose clothing case is very small so with this cubes she use her underwear and its creates space. Its handy.
My granddaughter loves these gloves.
"Man I bought this thing on Sunday evening anod was expecting it to come on Thursday or Friday. But no it came on Wednesday, the same day Captain America is Hydra now  in the comics, smh I need to put the Jordan meme on my shield. But this shield is lit I almost had a nerdgasm when I opened the box and saw the shield. But here's some things you need to know about it tho, my shield looked like it was already used and somebody returned it asap so it has a couple marks on it. But if you want to own a Captain America shield because of how awesome it is and always wanted one, then by all means buy this damn shield. But if you want to get into the Avenger business then go buy a real metal one or an exact replica and not a plastic one."
It's cute just was tight around the arms. Motivation for me to lose some more weight
"They're shoe laces, it's perfect. Color is exactly as displayed on my monitor."
My husband loves these! He said they are very comfortable and they are holding up well! He likes the style as well!
"These boots are cute, they're just like they're shown in the photo, but I thought they ran a bit large. I ordered an 8.5, which all of my other boots are, but even with thick socks they were big in the ankles and a bit wide, except in the toes, where the boot tapers a little. I recommend them for the price, although they're definitely not as comfortable as some of the more expensive boots. Wear them for the style, not the quality."
"These are good, strong, durable collar stays.  4 stars only because I have had the stay poke through 2 of my shirts."
"After reading the reviews I sized up and went with a 6 when I normally wear a 4. The 6 fit fine, would have liked to try the 4 to compare, but only the 6 was available for prime shipping so what can ya do? My measurements are 32D, 26, 38, 5'4, 127lbs. The dress was long even with 3.5in heels which resulted in me just parking myself at the bar instead of the dance floor. Still, this dress is amazing and I highly recommend it!"
Looks like it cost a lot more than it did. Very stylish.
My son liked these boots. They look nice and have held up well.
a tad tight
The thing I like the most is the sizing was quite accurate. The item last like was hoping the sweater was a little thicker material.  Still would recommend sweater to others.
although a little wide (i have to really cinch them down)  They still seem to fit well and are very comfortable.  They seem EXTREMELY well made
This is the only boot my 8 yr old will wear. More expensive than some of the others but worth the money. My sons first pair of John Deere boots has lasted through 3 boys. They are still in good shape but the sole of the heel has worn down til you can barely see any black. Pull on boots are so much more convenient than laces...they put them on themselves. So I'm not tying laces every time they take them off and on. Great buy. Will buy again.
I am a photographer and was asked by one of my relatives to do a photoshoot of her sons in SuperHero costumes. We decided to add my granddaughter into the photo at the last minute. I was praying I'd get the costume in time and I did. It came within a couple days. It is very cute I've attached photos
"I like the lens technology in these, but wish I had chosen a different frame color.  They protect my eyes very well on the trail.  Price was reasonable too.  They come in a very nice semi-rigid zipper case with a polyester sack.  Well done."
For once a shoe that is different and delivers on its cushioned foot-feel providing a very comfortable walk.  Would purchase again.
Makes pumping easier
I love it! It is much lighter than the other MK watches I own. I also had this authenticated and it is real. Great purchase at a great price!
Very nice shoe!
so cute!! I must buy another
Meet expectations.
"An excellent inexpensive (got it at a discount) bag for my summer wardrobe.  I love the inside zippered bag that has inner pockets for your cell phone and other items.  because it does have a zipper you can hide personal items from public view.  I think I could also use it as a beach bag if I wanted.  It is also the right size for me, not too big, not too small."
Very comfortable - and cute!
"A little tight, but they did not have wide in stock.  Lovely shoes to wear with skirts, dresses or slacks."
"These are really beautiful. They are much softer than most lace type of underwear that I have ever worn before. They have a nice stretch but are thin enough that you hardly notice you are wearing them. I am 5'5'' 125lbs and a size 2 dress and I got the size small and they are perfect. I love that you can get a variety of colors, and this style is my personal favorite for underwear. I am always looking for different brands since they all make them slightly different. These are very comfortable. The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star is that I have noticed upon wearing a few pairs that there are a few strings that are lose, not quite frayed but I guess I need to just clip it off. You can see it in the picture. It is not a deal breaker, because I think these are great, but I think it is something that the company can work on to make these even better and more durable. Also, be kind, I am in my underwear in the photo and that takes guts lol! Overall, very pleased with these! I got them at a discount to be able to give my honest and unbiased review and I hope that my feedback was helpful to you."
Colors look good and are represent well in the pics posted online. Comes rolled up very neatly and package well. Will be getting different colors to add to my wardrobe.
These are super cute AND supportive and comfortable.  Win win.
My husband wore this for our wedding. It fit perfectly and exactly as expected. Good quality fabric and good length as well. Most handsome man ever. 
"I love that the thumb tip flips back for easy texting. They're very comfortable and being able to just flip back the mitten part makes it so east when you run into a store or need to answer the phone without taking your gloves off (and dropping one). They're not meant for shoveling or cleaning snow off the car. They're not waterproof. But, they're the perfect weight for running errands and things like that when a thick pair would be too hot and bulky. I've worn them in 20 degree F temps for over an hour outdoors and stayed warm."
I carried this entire time on cruise and it has tons of pockets to keep you organized.
Good fit and it is comfortable.  Just enough padding for a smooth look under lightweight T shirts.
They run a bit large on my feet.  My heel was slipping out of them when I walked.  They look great though!
"Ordered these in a 12 first and they were too big, so exhanged for a 10 .. they fit perfectly.  I know I am not a 10 so they definitely run big.  I also saw other reviews that thought the the ""long"" were too long.  I didn't find that I am a little over 5'10"" and thought they fit fne.  Overall a good pair of jeans.  The sytle is ""work"" so I thought they would be too casual, but they look like regular black jeans."
"my girlfriend like it, great producto"
"Nice quality for the price, and very warm, with cute details like the thumb holes. However, not recommended if you have pets that are not the same color as your jacket. I have the black jacket and 2 white dogs, and I'm constantly removing dog hair from my jacket."
"Beautiful color! The main place where these sandels are on the large side are in the straps.  If you are looking for a snug fit, order smaller.  I typically am a 9.5 and ordered the 10 as half sizes weren't available in my range.  It's still a secure fit and is in no danger of falling off but I have a decent amount of room in the straps.  I have not worn these for an extended amount of time yet so I cannot speak for the durability but they didn't feel flimsy."
"Great little scarf. 'Little' being the operative word. Makes a cute little neckerchief (tied 50s style). I wanted/needed to find a larger version of this for when I actually want a lightweight scarf. It works for me as a cover for a bright lamp on the dinning room table. It's soft and sturdy, and has held up to machine washings."
"Super soft, super warm.  I got it for my husband, now I want one."
I love it.  It's simple and useful.  It's a perfect coin purse.
Beautiful Christmas  dress for my granddaughter. It is a Christmas dress for her program at school.
Our fourth one. Everybody in the family now has one in their favorite color.
Got these for my daughter 3 months ago and several of them already have holes in the heels and I have had to throw them away. So at least you can mix and match them. My daughter only likes thin style socks and it is hard to find any that hold up for a decent amount of time.
Order a size bigger. They run small. I Love them
I like it. It's cute. It's a nose ring. I don't know what more to say about it other than it's very shiny and has a nice coloring in the sunlight.
"Absolutely perfect. i have never known a more comfortable pair of pants, let alone as tactical pants. I prefer these over my sweatpants any day. The comfort is great, but also the quality of the stitching and construction too. These pants provide an excellent array of pockets and placements for your gear. If you are looking for a fantastic TacPant this is the one."
"This is a super comfy, very adjustable skirt. As other reviewers have stated, it is a bit see-through, even in the dark gray color I ordered. However, it washes beautifully, drapes wonderfully and is super comfortable. The waist is easy to fold over or all the way up or down, so adjusting the length is easy to do. All in all, it's a great skirt at a great price!"
After 2 semesters in college it is still holding pretty strong! The drink pouch is starting to wear a bit though. Looks great in the black/neon scheme. Holds all his school stuff WITH his overnight stuff.
"This is a nice, attractive ring with sparkling Zirconia. The ring itself is 2 mm wide and has 26 clear and soft pink stones each stone being also 2 mm along the ring. The rhodium has a silvery luster and the coating is smooth. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the inside is not a smooth surface but rather the outsides as walls with a gap in between. As the holes below the stones in the gap are of uneven size, it looks a little cheap when look at it from the inside. But overall it has a nice unobtrusive style to it which allows to focus on the nice stones. So overall, I think it is nice addition to the jewelry box."
Needs better cushioning for the footbed
It's very nice. I need it with gold accents too.
Boot was great.  Size runs small.
"Sexy, comfortable and my new favorite"
"Thinner then I thought but it's actually perfect for cards, a few dollars and change. Great for traveling :)"
"These fit great!  If you liked / like the Jockey Elance Bikini (which are not made any more) then you will like these. Soft, great colors, great looking with no double lining."
This is so much more than I expected. It is a very well made item and has places for your ID and Credit Cards if you want to put htem there. It works really well with the checks that have the carbon like copy and it feels great if you notice that sort of thing. Someone didn't like the little camaflouge strip but I do. You don't have to be a guy to like that either.
It's a decent wallet.
Very comfortable and soft. Nice for cold days. My daughter loves it
"I bought this for my elderly mom.  She has an issue raising her arm to get it on, so she can't use it.  It's a nice, summer weight gown... so I kept it rather than returning it!  The armpit-to-armpit width for the medium is 20 1/2"", the hip width (~16"" lower) is 30"" across.  I added this since when I shop for my mother I measure the width of things!"
I bought 1/2 size larger and very happy!!! Had fused spine and broken back surgery 7 months ago.. 3 days of Disney land in these shoes was heaven!!! My back and feet were great.. My husband was crying about his feet so I just bought him a pair too!! These shoes are amazingly cushy and saved my back!!! Carrying my 6 year old around the park too!!! Thank you sketchers!!!!!!
"Look good, feel good and last forever!  Arrived in a day. Had to exchange for a different size and it was all done in a week. Love them!"
"Nice everyday shoe, fits comfortably"
Great fit.  Nice heavy cotton fabric.
highly recommended to buy
"We have been very impressed with clothing from this vendor, and this one did not disappoint either.  Well made, beautiful fabric, our 3 y/o saw it and hugged it saying ""I LOVE IT!!!"""
It's difficult to find a small -sized cotton hat...it works.
"When I first wore this bootie, it left a blister on the big toe of my left foot.  Since then, though, I have found it to be quite comfortable and with very little to complain about.  The bootie is, moreover,  lightweight and very easy to walk in despite its heel height.  One of my colleagues has even dubbed it, ""sexy""."
"Bought this to wear under a rash guard shirt. I wear a 40C bra, bought XL and this fit comfortably like a sports bra with a little extra room to it. I think it will work well as a swim top under my shirt and so I won't have to wear a sports bra."
They are a little harder to walk in than I expected but I still managed without looking like a fool or rolling my ankles. Got many complements when I wore these to a wedding.
Good gear great fit for field work!!
"These clip-on sunglasses have excellent Polaroid protection. I purchased them through Amazon because of the low price and because shopping for a clip-on was inconvenient. These sunshades fit one of my glasses but do not fit the second pair. The reason for the fit problem is because of the support piece on the top of the glasses do not allow the clip to fit properly. However, the other pair fit perfectly and those are the ones that I will wear when outside."
They are as show. They are nice. And price is in the ball park.
"It's been about a year and I'm still wearing them. The fabric over the soles has torn up a little, but they're still holding up otherwise! Have gotten many compliments. They're lightweight and comfortable. I got more out of them than I was expecting for the price."
This is a good quality cardigan that looks nice. I have worn it to a conference and didn't feel like I was under dressed.
I love these and get so many compliments on them! I will definitely buy her shoes again.
"Got this to use on my back patio. Well made, but seems a bit pricey with shipping."
I don't know about arch support but these are absolutely darling shows AND I like that there are straps around top of shoe because my granddaughter has chubby feet and often regular shoes fall off.  I love the material they are made of AND the color.
I am usually wear a m/l in women's clothing (size 8-ish) and it was still pretty roomy! and i was scared that it would be too small. definitely not. but still a really nice top! i love it. it looks like an oversized tshirt. doesnt feel cheap at all and definitely worth the price. shipped in about 11 days (to nj) which i was surprised about
Have purchased these as a gift before and they are appreciated and enjoyed as they have been in the past.
These shoes are cuter in person than the picture. I loveeeee them im definitely going to order other colors.
"Just the perfect size. Not too skinny, and I've gotten compliments from my totally-not-gay coworkers (though maybe it would be more flattering if they were? Not complaining.)

Basically the fit is just right."
"Great earrings.  I had been looking for stud earrings for sometime, these are of high quality.  I love them."
"My baby didn't throw these off her face for at least 25 seconds, which let me take an awesome picture of her. They look cute, but since my baby doesn't know how to talk, I have no idea how the product actually performs. I assume they make the sun less bright. None of that matters though. Baby looks stylin for Instagram."
"These are my most comfortable shoes. They are so soft and padded on the inside, and don't rub any areas of my foot.  I can wear them all day, and they are really cute. They are good for hot weather and let my feet breathe nicely."
The colors are a nice type of pastel that go under any type of material and adds a pop of color.
"They are very nice,  comfortable ."
"I love the shirts from his company, they fit great for me...too bad they don't run bigger but for now it fits like a charm and the designs are cool too"
"Bought this for my husband and he loves it! Great price, and looks nice."
I've been buying Serenada brand from Lane Bryant....NEVER AGAIN!!!!  These are as nice if not a bit nicer than the LB ones AND the price is great.  And what's better than NOT having to get out to shop!!!!!!!  A winner for me!
"comfortable shoe ,very durable and the price is right-Neil"
"Good support in large bust, small ribcage. Just wish straps were more adjustable for short girls."
Still working today
These are great for easy diaper changing. They fit well and are a nice weight.
"Perfect size to carry in the cabin, Very good quality and finish."
Love the look of this ring and it's comfortable to wear.  Runs BIG!
"This bag is adorable as well as very big.  The little zipper bag that comes with it is also quite large.  It is very lightweight, which is what I wanted."
Great shoes for fall/winter months. Leather is nice. Pick some up when they're on sale
"Almost no panties marks. Nice materials, colors and design. Recomended."
"This is a very well built boot
My granddaughter had  lots of fun in the snow
And her feet was warm and dry"
"Good purchase, well made polo."
Great socks! Love them and have a few pairs now as I keep buying more.  Cute and the lace seems to be pretty durable as I have washed them in with the regular wash and they are still looking good.
100% cotton very comfortable my new fav boxers even with elastic exposed didn't bother me at all love them would buy agw
LOVE this hat. The older and more abused it gets the better. Bought one for a guy at my gym because he mentioned liking it. He LOVES it. Have had mine for 3-4 years
"The Lily of France Women's Value In Style Strapless Push Up Convertible Bra fit well and was very comfortable for my wife.

She noted how nice the bra felt against her skin.  The support was well placed and nothing felt uncomfortable.  She appreciated the option to re-orient the straps for a more customized feel.  She also liked the coverage provided at the sides for this bra."
"Every time I wear this chain, I get tons of compliments. It looks extravagant without being tacky, and goes with nearly everything."
"This bag I bought for my son for school. His school books are becoming very heavy and i needed a durable bag for him to carry them via wheels. Not only does it have wheels, but straps in case one wished to use it slung over the back. This bag is everything I expected. I am really happy with this purchase."
"Fun, fashionable and comfortable for a great price!"
"Definitely a toned down print, and I appreciate that. This is plaid in a good way."
"looks good, nice quality for price"
"These shoes are very nice. Perfect height heel and a great neutral style and color. The only thing I would change about them is the part that goes over the top part of your foot/heel and ankle strap is loose. I have wide feet and it is even loose on me. The part that goes over your toes is accurate size so that help to hold your foot in place and walking is no problem but i would say these would not work for someone with a very thin foot or ankle.
other than that LOVE these! they go with everything and are very comfortable!"
These jeans are so comfortable. I can wear them for work or just around the house. Well worth the money.
My lady loved it as do I
"Looks great, nice quality for the price, not the most comfortable.."
"Love this dress. It fit me perfectly and I got tons of compliments. It is dry clean only, but I'm sure it'd be fine on a gentle cycle. It does wrinkle, but I had no problems steaming it out. Great value for a great dress!"
"I'm 5'4"" 180 lbs, short and stocky with wide muscular shoulders and a gut, but I prefer to wear slimmer fitting clothes. I find that most scrubs fit way too big, like you're wearing a curtain. I really like the way the Dickie's unisex scrubs fit, but only when ordered a size down from my regular clothing size. They are relatively slim fitted, but with enough room to be comfortable to wear all day. Not the softest scrubs I've ever had, but definitely great for the price."
Better than expected.  Nice Material.  Very pleased.
"Stylish, elegant and love it!"
"I've worn the solid colors of these for a couple of years and just recently purchased the printed boxers.  I find them to be very comfortable, well-made, and they help smooth out a pair of dress slacks.  Wearing a pair of them right now!"
Loved these so soft and cozy
"This is a great bra for sleeping in, doing yoga, or those times when I don't want to wear a bra but don't want to be unsupported either.  My regular bra size is 38D, usually with underwire and I am tall (over 5'8"" with broad shoulders). After reading the earlier reviews I ordered this crop top bra in the large size with hopes that it would neither be too loose in some areas nor too tight in others; it did not disappoint - the fit is perfect!

Adding my two cents to some earlier comments and questions: I would not wear this bra outside of my home because I like more coverage and support when out and about; it also can't disguise the body's reaction to any temperature changes. While perfect for doing yoga or Pilates it doesn't give enough support for doing vigorous exercise (think Zumba, running, etc.) or sports.  It is all one piece with no fasteners and very stretchy so I find the easiest way to put it on is to step into in and pull it up over my hips and waist."
Great shirt. Unique! Hey it's the Stones!!!!!
I purchased these for my husband.  He loves them.  After many washings they have held up well.
"Good sandals, but the soles are kinda thick, which is fine if you don't mind feeling like you're walking on stilts all the time.  Also impossible to run in."
"I actually bought a size larger thinking it would run small but should have stuck with my own size.  No matter, it still looks great"
Really like this piece. Looked great and fast delivery. Can see some glue on the turquoise piece but only if you look carefully. Looks like real turquoise have gotten lots of compliments. I am really loving the look. Perfect length!
my favourite all time slippers .
"Great jeans. Always have been. Fit great and the black is a true black (take note, Old Navy: black is BLACK)."
Bought these for my step-father.  He said they worked out well and helped relieve a bit of stress around his neck from a too-tight collar.
"very nice bag, good pocket location, holds a lot, while still maintaining comfort.."
"I wasn't sure that this tie would be as good looking as it is. My first concern was that it is a woven tie, not a silk tie; however, it is a stunningly elegant tie. This tie is perfect with my olive suit and I receive numerous compliments when worn."
Cute! Running a little small
These are great for my on-the-go toddler. They are a great shoe for adults so I assume the arch support is equally as good for the kids shoes (obviously I can't verify this since I'm not the one wearing the shoes...) The color is bright blue and they match a lot of his clothes.
Nice material but the spandex frays after a while
"Fruit of the loom. Can t go wrong here. Fits as expected, and you get several pairs."
there carhartts enough said
I liked.  Comfortable and was good to travel in...I hated the back was low but for the price I have my nerveslol....I will defently purchase more colors from this seller
These ties make my daughter's uniform pop! They're super cute and tuck perfectly into the collar of her school blouses!
"I wasn't expecting too much from this costume but it turned out amazing. With the right wig and makeup, this is a show stopper. I had the best costume at the party."
Fits great! Love the uniform. Very professional.
Arrived on time it was just what I was looking for
These have become my new go to running shoes. The toe box is roomy enough to let my toes move around and not feel pressed together. I like the minimalist design and the zero drop. For me these have just enough cushion and I can still feel the ground beneath me. I only wish they had a better shoe lace.
very cushiony and nice wide toe box. I've worn Saucony for years but haven't tried the Ride before. Went to their website to see what would be the best for my foot and running and they recommended these. I love Saucony because they are true to the size and width. If you like a wide toe box get the C/D width and you'll be a happy runner. They are well made and fit perfect the first time out.
I read some other reviews that said the one size fits all is too tight . I wear a 6 7/8 and it fits snug. Probably close to the max size for this hat for a comfortable fit. I get a lot of compliments on this hat.
Nice item shipping slow
These are very Comfortable Slippers!
Haven't used these yet so will have to update after we get back from Ireland but on first inspection that appear to be exactly as described
these boots are very comfortable and they fit perfect however they are also very warm I order two pair one for my niece I will highly recommend these boots to anyone''''
"My daughter wore these sandals in red last summer, and they were so adorable. They held up nicely and seemed comfy. I'm probably going to purchase a couple different colors for this coming summer."
I bought this as a gift for my wife and she really likes it.  Nice watch face and comfy leather band.  My wife's wrist is thin and she has to use the innermost hole to secure the watch on her.  Watch probably fits better with slight bigger to medium wrists.  I was searching for a watch that wasn't too showy or glittery and this watch worked out well.  Overall pleased with the purchase and value so far.
"Great watch, period!!!!!!"
Very good quality and the size is always the same. If you dress L carhartt will be L forever. Some brands they change the size from manufacture for manufacture.
"pleased with them, as I have been with all my Clarks"
Bought this shoe for my son for school and its not only attractive. Its also comfortable and durable. The only downside to this shoe is that the suede at the front gets dusty a bit to fast. Overall a great shoe
Cute socks and fit is perfect.
Got these for my daughter for the new school year. She has tried them on and they fit great and she loves them. It will be a few weeks before she wears them but they look great and she said they feel great. Oh and they light up!! We didn't realize that until we got them!
"I LOVE this sweater! I ordered a large so it would be big on me and its perfect!
The sleeves tapper at the wrist/cuff so they aren't too flowy
The length is long and clings to my butt but thats ok! LOL!
I would order this in other colors!!!"
"Used these for my Arthur Halloween costume, and they definitely worked. They're unusually large, although they don't have any glass in them. This could be a good or bad thing, just depends on what you're looking for. But throw on these, a yellow sweater, jeans, and red shoes and you've got yourself a killer throwback costume."
I ordered a size up for my husband who is a traditional American Large size.
These shoes are so soft and comfortable.  No breaking in period at all.
Cute! It looks just like the real deal.
"Good size good quality, it fits me very well"
"Awesome! I bought 4 different pairs to try and these are the thickest, warmest, best initial quality. I rank these above carhartt, dickies and under armour."
"I bought these in brown a few years ago and loved them! I have been waiting for them to get more stock so I could get them in black for 3 years. These are the most comfortable shoes ever! The soles are tall and I like that because I have flat feet and I found that the taller the sole the less my feet hurt when I'm on them for too long. Very sturdy shoe. My first pair three years ago are still good structurally, but look old because they are beyond dirty, which is why I bought them in black this time."
feels like butter on your feet.  AWESOME!!
"Very itchy.  After washing a few times, these are not as itchy as before.  So I changed my rating from 2 stars to five stars."
Perfect. A nice casual belt. Its a wide belt. But works fine
"The sizing in these shoes is the biggest issue (no pun intended). Without exception, my closet is full of size 10 shoes and boots. I ordered these in a 10 and they were too big...much too big. Because they don't come in half sizes (so strange), I ordered a size 9. These do fit but there is no allowance in the length... a 9.5 would be just right if it existed. So, they are a full size too large. I love the grey color and the shiny studs really sparkle. They will, however, start to fall off. It's not really noticeable because the shoes are so sparkly and the studs so tiny. The other issue that I have with these shoes is that the brand tag is stitched onto the insole and while you wouldn't think it'd matter, it really is annoying. I use Tacco inserts in my shoes so that takes care of that problem. The shoes look really cute with everything.... cropped jeans, skinny jeans, skirts, etc., and I get a compliment every time I wear them. I liked them so much, I got them in both gray and black. I wouldn't invest a lot of $$$ because the studs will fall off but if you can get them on the cheap, do it!"
Finding a shoe in my size ( 7.5 AAA ) is a challenge. Finding a good looking shoe in this size is harder. This shoe fits and looks good too!
They fit great and look good.
I love this handbag!  The woven leather makes this bag so unique. I have been looking for a long time for this type of bag. Love it! Love it!
more comfortable than my birks and almost not as nerdy. very cool and will be seen on the streets of brooklyn any day now. Love them very very much
"Love this! I bought this specifically for skin to skin with baby, BUT, will be using it as a dressier option with jeans! Nice light flowy material. Haven't washed yet. It's plenty long, as some of the comments said too short. I'm 6' and it fits great!"
"I was wary of other reviewers complaints of ""cracking"", especially since these were under 14 bucks but assumed it was cosmetic and well, for the price and the fact that they are CROCS decided to risk it as I am pregnant and have been told by many to try them, but was reluctant because they are so UGLY and I didn't want to drop 40 plus dollars on ""cute"" ones before I knew for sure they would be as great as everyone says. Well, I plan to, and am a convert now! Regular shoes feel awful to me after these- and they haven't cracked yet but when and if they do I don't miind getting a new/different pair one bit."
I like it but my old pants were 34 32 and these were still longer then those. old were also 550
"Love them
True Clarks!!"
"Love this shirt, was looking everywhere for it, very happy"
My (very picky) daughter loves these boots.
"Bigger than expected for a size S, but it is exactly as portrayed, everything I was looking for."
I was looking for a belt that would hold up my paints but not dig into my side while carrying a backpack. This was it. It comes plenty long enough for even the big guys but can be trimmed to fit those of us thinner guys. It's tricky learning how to keep the belt tight enough and get it locked at the same time; but now I do it without thinking about it.
Use for skiing and were comfy and warm!
My husband loves these shoes. He said they were very comfortable and that I needed to get me a pair that is for women.
"Having had several other Skechers shoes, which I love, I decided to try these. They are as comfortable as my others.not much support; however, for long walks, but very comfortable for a stroll. They are even comfortable shopping in large, concrete floor stores. Oh my, they really glow! When charged they would be noticeable on an evening walk. Watch out though - if worn to am evening meeting they might attract too much attention. Lots of fun, and the operative word is comfort."
My son loves these shoes.  He out grew them in a few months but while they fit he wore them every day
"fit well,comfortable"
"Super cute dress.  Long enough to wear to work.  Fabric is a pretty typical printed cotton, a little stiff (think: fabric straight from the bolt in a craft store), but the pattern is vibrant.  A weird thing:  It comes with a separate belt-piece, which is basically a band of the same fabric with a two-button closure.  You can wear it with or without (I wear it with, because I think it defines the waist a bit more, but it looks fine without).  Cute dress; follow the size chart."
"This conditioner softened my hair and gave it a lot of shine.  It is thick and that helps it stay in your hair and condition.  The directions suggest leaving it in your hair for a few minutes to allow it to work.  It comes in a very pretty container as do all Obliphica products.  It may cost more than other conditioners, but I think it is a case of ""you get what you pay for""."
"I tried using the Bliss Crown Jewels collection that contained 4 skin products.

Some of the features are as follows:
1) These products contain vitamin C, E and green tea. The presence of these vitamins cleans and revitalizes the skin making it
  feel soft and shining radiantly as ever.
2) It imitates the skin treatment that one gets after visiting a spa.
3) It is a good gifting option for the holidays.

Benefits:
1) The lemon scented sage body butter moisturizes dry skin and smooth-ens it well.  It is non- greasy with mild a citrus
  fragrance.
2) The face wash acts as a cleanser as well as exfoliator to clean the skin of dirt and make-up.
3) The triple oxygen mask brings a glow to the face and wipes off the tired look. It has a mild scent.
4) The bliss love handler is a cream that one applies to the waist everyday. The  product claims to reduce the body fat along
  with exercise and a balanced diet over a period of time. I have to try the results as yet. Will update my review later."
Really cute assortment of onesies!
"LOVE this dress! Super soft material and so figure flattering! I'm 5'4"" 125lbs and a small fit perfect though it would be a little short on anyone any taller. I will definitely buy other patterns!"
I received this shirt on time and was pleasantly surprised that it fit perfectly. Seems so many times I order too large. The fabric is great. No scratchiness that comes with subpar quality and the screen print is clean and professionally done. I'm very pleased with this shirt overall and will wear it for many years to come.
Beautiful Ring much more than I expected!!! Thank you.
Got this for my gf and im sure she will love them!
This is one sexy top. I love the chain that runs down the back. It fits true to size. Vibrant color  (magenta). Love Pattyboutik
"If you're like me, you enjoy a crisp professional look. These metal collar stays keep your collar looking razor sharp. The collar stay box keeps your stays neatly organized for quick retrieval."
"UPDATE: 1-19-13 After three short months, the seam between the sole and the boot started separating, creating a big hole. I called Timberland and was given instructions about how to send them in for warranty review. Happy to report they shipped me a brand new pair, which arrived just a little over two weeks after I'd sent in my damaged pair. Disappointed I this happened, and hope there's not a repeat, but very happy that the company stood behind the product!

I need waterproof boots for walking my dogs, and these fit the bill perfectly, with the added bonus of looking cute! These boots do a much better job of cradling my foot for a comfortable walk, unlike knee-high rain boots which I always feel like my feet are sloshing about in, making walking up or down hill difficult. The only down-side of short boots is that water and debris that gets kicked up does sometimes land in my boot, but for me, the comfort factor makes up for that. Plus, my feet don't sweat in these--I even wear them in 80 degree weather if it's wet without any overheating discomfort!"
"Love it. Dainty, sparkly and with just hints of diamonds which are not really seen by the eyes but you know it's there. Good for the young and not so young and can be worn at work or everyday. Great gift item."
Does what its supposed to do and hasn't shown any wear even though it gets daily use.
Great shoes just as expected.
"my ""boys"" are 40 & 59 and can never have enough Star Wars Stuff especially with the big ""Epic Pictures"" coming out. my one son got Chewbaka last year so my younger son gets these."
"Though my size is medium, I ordered a large because I wanted an overshirt for sun and insect protection and for a secure pocket for my phone. It met all expectations, plus it is cool (even in 90+ degree weather) and the color is pretty. It washes and dries easily and quickly. Great shirt!"
Beautiful piece. Appropriate size
"These are a thicker sock, which is good if you live in snow country to wear with boots, etc."
"Very cute, good size, arrived on time and in good shape.  It will be perfect for gifts for my kid's friends.  Highly recommend."
"Beautiful angels wings earings,."
"I like the watch a lot, but , unfortunately, seemed to have developed an allergic reaction to the leather strap. I need to buy another strap not made from leather. Hope that I can switch them myself ."
Very simple yet beautiful
"Wear these all day working at a hospital, usually on my feet. Very comfortable. Fit great too."
"Super comfortable, and great fit."
"What can I say?  It's an ASICS, which are known for their quality.  However, this one for me was just a little too colorful and I felt that it made my foot look longer than it should.  The fit was good but I just didn't care for the look so I returned them.  If you like this color style and you like ASICS, you will probably like this shoe."
"Great shoe but limited ankle support, which is the reason I purchased them. Very comfortable,"
"My husband bought this for me for Christmas.... they fit great , true to size. Im very happy. So comfortable... Husband gets brownie points for this ......"
"Actually fits true to size!!!
I'm loving this swimsuit more in person than in the picture!
It's true to color, fits as expected, && washes well.
I'm 5'2, 135lb, 34DD && ordered a Asian L/ US Medium.
My only complaint is that the bum is a little cheeky, but for the price, quality and professionalism of the seller, it's a win, easily.
The mesh is sewn well && continues throughout the back.
Dont worry though, all of the hidden places are well hidden which was a concern with the crack area.
I posted an outfit with another Amazon purchase on my blog, TheSimpleAndSweetCo. Com && it's one of my highest complimented outfits.
Products this great takes the guess work out of online shopping."
"This is my spare pair.  Love the fit, the feel and the look."
Excellent fit. Cips seem very sturdy.
"These shoes fit excellent and they are very soft and confortable!!!
Recommended to everyone who is looking for a shoe to be use all day!!!"
"It's lovely and it fits all the right curves. However, for the bustier women out there be warned that the cleavage will be on show."
"Great product, my daughter will love her matching outfit for Christmas"
"My new favorite work pants. I bought 3 different colors so far.  Comfortable, snug in all the right places, great color. I gave a rsting of 4 because I haven't washed more than 5 times so uncertain of how well they will hold up."
Fabric is durable
"This is my 2nd on-line order of Clarks and the first success.  The first order and replacement for a pair of pumps were both too big that I did not think I'd give Clark's a try again.  I wasn't particularly looking for a pair of boots (in May) but when this popped up on ad panel of my screen, it piqued my interest because it has the basic/classic design I've been searching for: no frills and a bit of heel.  And it was discounted! The design is as expected (classic) and just the right walking heel.  The material and craftsmanship is of good quality.  The right boot fits like a glove (foot and legs) and left boot requires a bit of pull to zip up.  My calves: right=14 1/8""; left=14 2/8"".  There is enough elasticity in the boot material for that 1/8"" difference that I believe it will all work out.  It's soft to walk on around the house and I am hoping it feels the same during longer walks on city street.  It's a keeper."
Love these shoes!! Great for work
Little tight as first but does stretch out to fit perfect.
"This is a gorgeous handbag! It looks and feels like leather and is made so very well. It will hold everything
anybody should need to carry in a handbag. It is very rich looking and a handbag that I am proud to carry
and be seen with. It sure looks like it costs a lot more than it does, and that's a fact! Plus, who else gives you
two extra bags, when you're just buying one? Excellent product! Five Stars PLUS+++++++"
Fits as stated.
Great fit and style! Liked it so much I bought two more!
Nice deep jade color and light.  Perfect since I can't wear heavy earrings.
Only issue is the part that fits around the ankle is a bit hard so it scratches my legs. I wear taller socks to bypass the issue. Love the shoe.
"I am 6'2"" 185 and this shirt fits perfect (XL). Sleeves are not too short and the length is just right for me. Material has great feel to it as well."
Luv the size its cute 
"This is my sixth pair of Alisha ankle jeans. That says it all. They are a superb fit (am normally a 16 but the 14 in NYDJ are perfect), great quality and above all flattering. Am so pleased to have discovered this style, and now have them in summer and winter weights. They are consistent is fit and quality. And for jeans to fit this well when I cant find anything of similar fit when buying from a store, says a lot for online shopping."
Best color . Fits well and is true to size. It looks like an expensive coat . I recommend it. I can't wait to wear it on valentine day
"I like it, easy open and I can adjust easy for when sitting or have to get up for longer walk, use it with uniform and looks great, a little stiffer which is what I wanted to hold my phone and torch flashlight"
This little jacket is soo cute!
just right for casual comfort.  It does add more support than most of these type bras
"I don't like the design as much as I expected, but the fit guidelines worked, enabling me to pick the size that worked. It feels comfortable, easy to put on, and does the job."
great price and fast shipment
Great boots. I wear a size 12 on lace up shoes and boots but the Wellington pull on style I wear 11.5 and these fit good. Not heavy and good comfort. These are my first muck boots and will wear them a lot to test them.
"This is not a real fancy wallet, but it does what it's designed for well and for the price you really can't beat it."
I love this wallet!!! It is super cute and it has just the right amount of space I needed! It came wayy quicker than what was estimated!
It was a little large- but that turned out to be good- I could wear a jacket under it!
I now have 2 of these and they are my favorite workout bras!
These are good quality shorts for the price but they do run a bit small.  They are comfortable and the elastic waist stays put.
LOVE super fast shipping!
"Especially considering the price, this is a very nice holder for plastic cards.  I was pleasantly surprised and intend to order another one for backup.  Not only has it allowed me to consolidate the cards I was carrying, but because it has room enough for my check book, I was able to eliminate carrying that as well.  Considering how many cards most of us carry these days, it's amazing how few products there are of this type and, as far as I can tell, nothing ""high end."" I carry only 2-3 actual credit cards, but everything from my library card to my AAA card to the discount card for the pet food store is plastic.  And now that I have this credit card holder/check book, I'd love to find a smaller regular wallet just to hold my money and driver's license.  If I could only find one of those!!! :-)"
My son loves these slides. He wears a 9.5 in regular shoes and size 9 in these is perfect.
"Using it at my desk with the Madla Pump In Style. works great. The fabric is firm, but soft and hold the shields very well. Would recommend as a must with any double pump."
"I loved this jacket but was just one size too small.  It was not a manufacture issue just that I fit better in a 46 but they only had 44.
The jacket is beautiful and comfortable and for the price I highly recommend if they have your size."
"This run somewhat small but i love the design.
Would recommend them to anyone"
Should have purchased a half-size larger than I normally wear
My firend loved this scarf!
"I really like my sneakers, they are very comfortable, stylish and clea wish there were more colors to choose from."
"Very happy with this purchase.. they were exactly as described, arrived prompt.. would buy again."
"What can I say it's underwear. Fit just as expected and materials seem fine to me, would definitly purchase again."
Too big for toddlers
These gloves are warm and work great for use with touch phone and other devises so good my oldest grandson swiped them from me.
"As described, I used these for my business and was proud to send my jewelry in them.  Will order again!  Strong and natural-looking."
"I'm 7 months pregnant, which means lots of things but for this review's purposes, it means my gorgeous wedding ring doesn't fit. Since this is a temporary issue I don't want to have it sized. So I checked Amazon for a cheapo stand-in. This thing has decent reviews for a good reason. It's pretty and sparkly but not so gaudy that it's clearly fake. I can tell it's fake but I doubt others are scrutinizing it as closely so it'll do for the next few months."
Great lookin shoe but the fit is a lil  snug
It was perfect for what I needed it for.  Fits nicely and the material feels kinda like cotton sheets.
It keeps the feet warm as expected
"Fit well...little girl was glad to be an ""ice fairy""/"
"Nice watch but I can't see the hands at night, had to return."
"Love the length, as I'm 5ft 9-10ins tall & they do hit the ground. Lovely colour (taupe) & nice material. I ordered the small, but they are a bit tight around the hips, but not enough to return them.  Very good, especially for the price."
I bought a medium. the pants fit very well. I weigh 140 pounds and the shirt was a little tight.
"comfortable, great size and quality. Prime shipping on point."
"These are EXACTLY what I was looking for - a pull-on short without the hassle of zippers and buttons, a short but with a good length and not too short or too long! I initially bought the denim color and liked the comfort and fit of this short so much I ordered a second one in black. I'm considering ordering again but sizing down this time. I debated about checking the ""fit as expected"" but decided on the ""somewhat large"" just because they do fit a little loose on me but even with that factor, they are ultra comfortable and since I wear them ONLY around the house or working in my yard (as a senior with aged legs and more specifically ugly knees, I feel I do the public a favor by not wearing ANY short outside my home) :-). These fill my needs perfectly. If I had a ""request"", I'd love to have them have real back pockets, as these are faux pockets but even without the back pockets, I love them. I wouldn't have bought them at all had they not had at least front pockets and they are nice and deep to allow for a cell phone, etc. Also, I feel they are priced very reasonably!"
Nice for 8 yr old G daughter
Super duper comfortable
"Beautiful sandals, very comfortable"
Pretty dress for a special occasion. She loved it and it fit just right. Girl just turned 12. We ordered a size 12 and fits just right.
Cute t-shirt used for my sons first birthday party. Little long but it worked anyways. Didn't really shrink after washing either
"I absolutely love having a hook on my key chain to easily hook my keys to my person or my purse when they are not in use. This key chain is nice because the keys are not on the hook, they are attached below the hook on another ring so the keys will not easily come off. The key chain comes with a nice box to make this a nice give for someone because it is reasonably priced. :-)"
I just love this shoe!!! Also bought the blush. Returning this color only because it's just too gold for my liking. I expected a more dark  bronzed gold. Very comfortable and great quality. Perfect heel height!
"My granddaughter has somewhat narrow feet (size 2) so she finds these very wide. They are OK for wear at the beach, but she cannot wear them for running around and play as she has with earlier Crocs."
"The best running socks, hands down.  Not so much padding as to be bulky, and they are not slippery.  Just perfect."
"The Sebago Men's Cayman II is a sturdy good looking loafer.  My only criticism is that the shoe is a little larger than true to size.  If I were to buy another pair of these shoes, I'd probably buy them in a half size smaller."
"LOVE THIS SHOE! I've even wearing Vionic shoes for a year and I rarely have pain anymore. I had plantar fasciitis and was in so much pain the minute I stood up or walked for any length of time. I don't know if it was the Vionics that helped heal me feet but that's the only thing I've done different. This is my favorite pair, I'm on my 3rd pair."
Absolutely. Stunning
"This infinity scarf is beautiful, stylish, and light weight.  Perfect for the fall and spring seasons.  I have received many compliments and would highly recommend this scarf."
"These fit my son very nicely.  He's 280# & 6'2"" so plenty of tummy coverage is very much appreciated"
"These are comfortable boots and have great traction. I wish I had ordered one size smaller as they are pretty big on me. Other than that, I have no complaints."
These are great looking shoes and at the price I picked them up for (sub $100) you can't go wrong.
"Everythng I have bought from this company is well worth the $
."
Bought this for a 30's ladies Tea at my church.  We are all supposed to wear hats from the 30's' and this is perfect.  Pretty too!!!
Nice bright red with great graphics. Long but fits nice! Slim fit is but not tight which is best about the style.
I got two to use as a ring jacket/guard I'm very happy they work with a few of my rings round and cushion cut solitaires the band is thin and seems to run a lil bit small I ordered Size 7  I only wear them occasionally
Love these. So comfy and no vpl.
the shoe part of the boots are wide. however they are very warm and not hard to get in to or get out of
Great summer shoes. Would recommend to everybody.
"Very light-weight.  Will start using this when I travel rather than my heavy leather one.  Wish it was just a little smaller, so it would fit in my front pocket of my jeans."
Love these glasses!! The only problem is it came with a scratch on one of the lenses.
"I went to NY this Summer and I have a new found love for any item with NY on it or in it!  This is well made, the gold is very pretty almost vintage looking.  I love it!  I will look for another with my home state of WV on it!"
Love the tails that stays tucked in
Very nice champion t shirt knit shorts. Very comfortable. Would definitely purchase again
"I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a half-size larger, which was perfect. The adjustable straps allow me to get a better fit across the top of my foot, and the arch support makes these sandals comfortable enough to wear all day. Also, I love the color. Bright enough for spring/summer, but not overwhelming."
"For the price, the quality is much better than I expected. I like ""Light In The Box"" tiara products for formal occasions when high quality is expected, but this is definitely wearable for an ""over 60"" birthday party. The combs make it very comfortable to wear. The size is perfect. not too large or small."
Nice wig
"If you're a bike commuter looking for a shoe you can ride in and wear around a casual office, this is a great shoe.  I've got a 30 mile round trip commute in the Boston area and I've been very impressed with this shoe.  I've used it for about 360 miles of winter riding so far and they are very solid.  As a pedal platform, they are fairly stiff.

I've used them comfortably down to 13F coupled with thick socks, chemical warmers, and Planet Bike toe covers.  The shoes are well-ventilated via mesh uppers, so they are not water proof or water resistant.  Without the covers I don't think they would very comfortable much below 50F.  I bought size 45 so I would have room in the shoe for the thicker socks and warmers.  I normally wear size 43.

My coworkers, used to my more standard bike shoes (Diadora MTB shoes) were surprised that these were bike shoes.  Several asked if I had retrofitted regular shoes.  They are comfortable enough to walk around in and the cleats (yes, you have buy them separately) are recessed enough that you don't sound like you're wearing tap shoes.

I'm very happy with the SH-MT33L shoes.  I would buy them again and recommend them to a friend without hesitation."
It is good thank you
"This is a quality wallet. My husband loves that it isn't bulky and doesn't scream ""I have a wallet in my pocket"" while wearing it."
"Living in the northeast, winter is a brutal battle! Now I am ready! Love Sporto. Waterproof is a plus. True to sz, wear an 8.5, ordered an 8.5. Fit is perfect! Thanks Amazon!"
A complete hit...a few times!!
"I bought a pair of these Z Sandals for myself and my sister-in-law, now all of my sistes want a pair.  The comfort is incredible and so is the support, just right for everything."
"These shoes are freaking perfect. Not kidding, size and look are awesome mcawesomesauce. They feel like socks. I was worried about the opening to put  my foot into the shoe because it looked small but once it's on, it's fan-freaking-tastic!!! Love them, will definitely buy again once my running wears em down!"
I have worn these for 15+ hours per day (work and night school) and they are so super comfortable!  No break-in time required; they fit perfect right from the box.  I can testify that they are waterproof.  I highly recommend and would buy them again.
"string is much thinner than the ones I got before, but they will work."
My 2 and a half year old loves Minnie and she keeps talking about her cute new panties!
"Classic, timeless boots are a lot harder to come by than I originally expected. I browsed for months, but never could find
exactly what I was looking for. I like the old-school look - something you might've seen James Dean, the young Marlon Brando,
or Steven Mcqueen wear. I wanted a pair the lightweight, non-bulky, vintage (for lack of a better word) looking boots to wear
casually, and while I'm riding my cafe racer. I finally came across Caterpillar's Orson boots, and they completely fit the bill.

Caterpillar's Orson boots look great, and are relatively comfortable, but there are a few complaints I have that keep them from
being the perfect pair of boots: They are ONE WHOLE SIZE larger - so order ONE WHOLE SIZE SMALLER. It's that easy. The color is
not a traditional color leather, as they are pictured on Amazon. They are a blend of dark brown, olive green, and a hint of grey.
This bothered me initially, but I've grown used to the color. It definitely doesn't take away from the overall old-school vibe of
the boot.

I've only worn them for a week now, but I can say if you are looking for an affordable pair of classic, casual boots made by a
reputable company, I would definitely recommend these."
"Very nice shirt! I will use it for mc rides and just casual days, the quality is good.  I am 5'2 145 and large is just perfect, but if I could order it again I would probably order an extra large if they have it.  I will wash this in gentle and not dry it! I do not want it to shrink!"
3Rd Pair of Keen's and love how light they are plus this style is probably my favorite.  Looks good with black jeans and is very very comfortable.  Even though it's a 10.5 it makes my feet look little.
"I love beanies and this was no exception. Very thick material and it fits so nicely. Made me very comfy and warm. Also, covers really bad hair days."
Beautifull !! Everyone should but one!
"Finally a medical necklace that is affordable, allows all necessary engraving, emits a clear message. I just wish that it offered a longer chain."
ok clogs!
"I have very wide feet, and bought the extra wide they fit perfectly! The leather is amazing super soft. Color is true and they are good quality. I love Bella Vita shoes and will continue to order from them since they have such a good variety of widths."
"Great material, as always buy original stuff"
"This watch is exactly as advertised.  It makes a very good casual/dress watch, keeps accurate time, is rich looking and well made."
This is perfect!! So beautiful!! So sexy!! Cant wait to surprise my guy when I wear this...I know he'll love it!!
Fast shipping and I love the product
"Gave this as a gift and haven't heard about the fit. There are other Hello Kitty dresses in her closet but this one will be more practical for preK. Like that it has zip pockets (""Ooooh"") and is easily washable - I did that before giving, just to see how it came out and I was pleased; no ironing, either. Four stars since I don't know the fit. Everything else was great."
"I got this sweater for an ugly sweater party. It fits perfectly and is actually really well made. Plus, you can never go wrong with nipples on a sweater. Next year you guys need to add Trump riding with his arms around the Putin-like Santa!!"
"The stripe that goes along the length of the foot is a bit crooked, but I still think they look great."
It's exactly what I was looking for! It's very pretty!
I wanted them bigger. So she can grow into them.
"Purchased the adidas Women's Energy Cloud tennis shoe for my daily workouts and so far I have no complaints regarding comfort, durability, and aesthetics. Love the lightweight feel, mesh technology, and superior cloud foam cushion to eliminate extra stress on my body when performing intense workouts. Would definitely recommend. Was definitely influenced to purchase because I was able to get it at a very reasonable price, so with that aside, I was more than happy with the overall performance after wearing it."
"Very Light compared to My Shimano R106 shoes. They flex a great deal more. The tongue bothered me a bit on one foot, just an adjustment for break-In. They do stand out which is what I wanted."
I should have purchased two more!
"The white is more off white, but you probably wouldn't notice unless you compare. even with the layers, it's slightly transparent but not terribly so. I'm have a 27in waist and the 'one size' isn't as snug as I'd like, but it fits fine. I'm 5'4 and skirt goes just below my knees."
"Pretty darn cute, thin leather around the top but looks exactly like the photo."
beautiful...my little princess loved it
"well made,love the color."
Trying to find great socks for a men's size 15EEEE foot is never easy.  These socks are absolutely great.  They feel good and come out of the wash nice.  They are a recommended buy for a big guy!!
As advertised with quick delivery.
super comfy & cute
Great lookin shirt
It seems to be a good top but perhaps slightly smaller than expected and shorter than I'd like. A size larger might work better but an extra inch in length would be nice.
Sized up and it's a perfect fit. Extra length in torso and sleeves gives great coverage. Nice smooth fabric. Color is more lavender than pink. Well-made and great price.
"I love these pjs, so soft and silky, super comfy and they have a wonderful fit!  They are light too, which I like and so will most pregnant and fourth trimester moms, what with the hot flashes most of us get!  I did receive them at a discount in hopes that I would leave an honest review (not required) but I liked them so much I felt I should share how I felt.  You WON'T regret getting these maternity/nursing pyjamas!  Oh, and it was super easy to pop the giant milk jugs out. ;)"
Fits good - Looks good and use all the time . Definitely recommend.
These are slightly larger than other skecher shoes I own and not as comfortable as their Go-Walks I recently purchased locally on sale. This is not to imply these shoes are bad but the Go-walks have spoiled me with their cloud like comfort.
"The material is nice and thick and very soft. I have a long legged baby so its a tad short, but I expected that."
"For me these have a standard fit (Size Med....5'7""  @140 lbs....a little bottom heavy).  The black fabric is very heavy with a soft side...and the fabric is stiffer than most fabrics for sweats.  They did shrink about 1"" in length when I washed and dried them on medium cycle.  No width shrinkage and they do stretch out widthwise with wear.  I like the shape of these...not as frumpy as most sweatpants.  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is lack of pockets....just one would have been nice."
"i really love these, pretty color and perfect size, i think i will keep wearing them very often. so glad bought these, the stones were perfectly set, simple yet elegant."
Very beautiful ring! It was a birthday gift for my sister and she loved it.
It's original and strong material but the size come little small .
OK for the price.  The Grandchild loves them so that's all that matters..
Very satisfied.  Will return for next pair.
Love this. Shipped fast
You can never go wrong with Shawdowline products.  They are great!!!  Love the material.  These gowns and robes wash so Nicky and werat very well.
"I wanted waterproof boots that were big enough to tuck jeans and fleece boot liners into.  These are perfect!  They are easy to get on and off, completely waterproof (I have waded in Lake Michigan with them on), and are comfortable also.  Highly recommended"
This is a great product with fast shipping
Love Fruit of the Loom - wouldn't hesitate to purchase again
I am hard on jewelry and this has stood the test of time. I get lots of compliments on this ring!
"I have narrow feet and really narrow heels.  These are one of a few shoes that does not give me blisters on my heel from being too wide.  I have them in the pink, the mint, the burgundy, the olive, and the coral, and rotate them so as to not wear them all out at the same time.  New Balance is not partnering with HK anymore so I don't know what I will do when I need to replace them.  Hope I can always find them on Amazon.  Love all of the style and colors.  HK thought of everything!  They all go well with my crazy prints or just black capri leggings.  I did not find that I had to size up on any pair that I bought.  Most other reviews said to go up a half size, but I did not find that to be the case.  I use them as cross trainers outside and in the gym.  They give plenty of support and good traction.  Good to wear to and from yoga class too.  Great shoes!"
I was order a half size smaller with Salomon's. My favorite brand and these boots did not disappoint!
I loved these shoes but they are much too tall for me. I felt like I was walking on stilts - had to send them back or else I would've twisted my ankle trying to wear them!
I bought these as a birthday gift for my mom. She has the ring and the necklace but hasn't been able to find the matching earings in at least sterling silver. She's going to love them. They are gorgeous! I can't wait to give them to her. :)
This dress fit very nicely!  The fabric is very soft and washes very well.
"decent pant at a great price.  Like that they have pockets, are lightweight, and super comfy.  I bought two pairs..."
the recipient loves them! I recommend the LARGE size for anyone taller than 5'; I had to return them at my expense3; excellent turnaround time.
"My little sister loves it so much, she won't even take it off!! The glitter are pretty and the dress itself is absolutely beautiful!"
"Lovely, knee length. Exactly as pictured. Does not hang but you can use a belt. I absolutely love the orange on top, gives the dress a pop!"
I really like it overall but the seam under my cheat is itchy
Daughter loves it. bought my daughter got a large and its tight around her B cup. just saying ladies...
"It's a gift so cannot say about the size unless she wears it, I'm sure it be fine. Loved the dress I bought 2 different colors."
Love these for around the house.  They are easy to pack so they are my go to for travel.
Very nice quality. Would buy again.
"Love Karen Me
Loved  this gown."
VERY comfortable. Not binding nor droopy. Just the right thickness to wear with work shoes.
"This watch is the perfect size, I wanted a big enough face that it is easy to see and goes along with the trend of larger faced watches. The band is delicate in size but sturdy leather with a casual look that goes with anything I wear. I have been wearing it a week so far, at work and home and it seems to be holding up well."
"Honestly, they make my shoes more comfortable when I wear them in the winter, be it the extra padding."
Beautiful yellow colour of the bolero and lifts the colour of the dress. A worthwhile purchase with a pretty look.
"These are the best non-socks, and I've tried them all. There is enough to that they won't fall off. There is rubber heel backing for non-slip on back and they are no show enough to be worn with Converse."
Perfect size and great quality.  They sparkle and look great. These are sure to please anyone. Came in a gift box so nothing was bent or damaged.
Fit really good. Cool to
"Note: You have to sow down the lace on the arms manually. The first picture is not the same dress, the next pictures are. I'm 5'4 and 120 i could perhaps wear is as a paternity dress. It's high waist, like right under your chest. It's kind of see through, it's not layered."
the jeans were not what I thought I ordered
"LOVE this watch! It's so beautiful, it fits perfectly on my small wrist after taking off the one easy to remove extra link, and the face is big enough to SEE the time."
I like it a lot but it needs some time to break in. First time I wore it out to new york city where you have to walk a lot I ended up with blisters on my heals.
"Beautiful bag! It is perfect for short outings with one baby, but it's too small for extended outings or for gear for more than one child. I like that the strap easily clips on/off as I have resorted to hooking toys and my folding changing pad to the outside of the bag to save space inside."
"I purchased two of these hats along with some gloves for a couple of homeless gentlemen.  They fit perfectly and should keep a head warm.  But, it is difficult to tell at the moment because we are still having a lot of hot weather.  These hats stretch to the size needed.  The material is very soft and not scratchy.  I recommend this hat to anyone who will be out in the weather when it starts to cool off."
This shoe has been my favorite running shoe yet! It's more of a minimalist type shoe but it offers plenty of stability and support. I ran my first marathon in these! Love them!
"Exactly as pictured. The dress came to my knees (5'5"" and got a large) and is airy enough to wear in the heat. The straps are adjustable, and the fit is great. The material is not see through. Comfortable and cute would sum it up."
"These things are fresh to death! The wood isn't as heavy as I would've liked, but damn...it's made of wooooood! How dope is that? The answer?...very dope. I'm saying, if you want to look fresh, get these shades. Haters may throw shade, let 'em. Keep it real y'all."
"This isn't real leather but it is so beautiful and sexy. I had a lot of fun wearing it to an event last week. It fits perfectly and laces up on the back and sides so that it is adjustable. The skirt is cute and flirty and makes my booty look great! The leather look is hot and my fiance loves it. It makes my figure look great, and I am pretty curvy when it comes down to it, petite too. This runs small so pay attention to the sizing.
I recieved this for free in exchange for my honest review."
Very nice tie and great price. Love the colors.
I love these t shirts i wear them all the time
"I love these, they are very cute, very stylish, for either male or female (I am female), and fit very well, and seem sturdy, great cheap price, but wonderful product, doesn't seem like it would break easily or anything, and they came very quickly as well.
the only problem I have with them is that I cant wear them for a long time (I wear contacts), without getting a headache, I don't know if this is just me or not, but thought that I would write this into the review to let you all know. I still recommend these, since I still like them, they are cheap, but great, and you don't really wear them that long anyway, (0r at least I don't), to give you that much of a headache, just take them off for a bit and you should be fine. the lenses are clear and does not mess with my vision at all though!"
"Very cute and well made. This is womens, not juniors sizing. I am 5'1/135 and got a medium. It fit perfectly."
"Probably my most cherished piece of trail/outdoor gear are my La Sportiva hiking boots.  We've seen a lot together.  We've spent a lot of time together.  So it was with no small amount of concern that I noticed the Vibram sole coming detached in several places.

I took the boots to a local cobbler.  Well, cobbler in name only, as he declared in no uncertain terms that these boots were ""impossible"" to fix.  Impossible?  Hardly!  The sole itself still had lots of life left in it.  It didn't even have any holes, and the treadwear was nowhere near where a replacement sole would be the best course.  Impossible.  Bah.  I spent hours getting these boots broken in just right.  No way in hell am I going to buy all new boots for this, not when all that was needed was to re-cement the sole to the shoe.

I was all set to buy some Shoe Goo when, in my internet reading, I came across an article in Backpacker magazine where my exact issue was described.  The equipment editor's prescription?  Freesole.  So I bought some.  And $7 worth of freesole saved my boots.

To be sure, it's important to follow the directions but with a little more care to give yourself the best conditions for a permanent fix.  In this case, I let it cure for 48 hours, not overnight.  I did NOT skimp on the cement, used a plastic knife to spread it smoothly, and used extra Freesole on the seam to make sure it would hold.  Lastly, I weighted the boots rather heavily to make sure there was a good seal, and I used paracord to add pressure to the sole and boot where a weight wouldn't fit.

And yes, I'm serious about the 48 hours.  Be patient.  DO NOT fiddle with it while it's curing.  Just put it aside and forget about it for two days.  When you revisit it, you'll find a very durable and waterproof seal, even better than the factory cement.

This is very good stuff.  It's by no means a fast fix (meaning don't count on this to save your bacon on the trail for ad hoc repairs), but it's a long lasting one.  I'm very happy with this."
"A review sample was provided for free or at a discounted price for the testing and evaluation of the product, and writing and posting a review. These well-made sunglasses offer a unique take on a classic look. The metal frame is very strong, with firm hinges and nicely curved earpieces. The way the top bar, bridge, and dual rims give them a unique strength while still remaining comfortably light weight. Even the nose pads are metal. The lenses are clear and dark -- without being too dark -- and filter out glare very well. A nice pouch and non-scratch cleaning cloth are included. All together, they look and feel very well made with a fashionable new design for this classic look."
"Very flattering, fits well and kept me suprisingly warm as they are actually thin.  If you get the white ones, be careful what color jeans you wear them with.  My dark blue jeans stained them and they won't bleach out.  Doesn't bother me as no one else will really see the ""seat.""  I love the front and the way it holds everything - the support is great especially if you don't like your junk going everywhere."
"Very durable shorts!  I have 2 boys ages 11 and 13, and they survived almost the entire school year!"
"This material was slightly different from the blue jean I also bought in this style, and they attract animal hair like nobody's business.  Otherwise, they are great.  I am about 125 and 5'4"", with big hips. I love the fit, and that I don't have a gap on my back for the waist. I wear them with 2"" boots, and the length is just right. The back hem touches the ground when I wear sneakers."
"I bought Carhartt work dungarees since I wanted durable pants I could use for snow blowing, cutting the grass, and doing other work around the house.  I also am a teacher, so I need pants that will look good for me in school.  These pants sure are just right for outdoor work and school.  What I like is the back pockets are nice and large.  My over-sized wallet fits perfectly.  The front pockets are big enough and sturdy enough to hold everything you want to put inside. The other benefit is that since they are work dungarees, the pockets are designed to carry all sorts of items in them without getting holes in them.

I am a physically larger person and these pants actually make me look good.  They fit really well.  The best part is that when you bend, stretch, or pick up something you aren't going to have a blow out on the side of the pants or in the crotch area.  I just wish I had purchased these about ten  years ago. There are also added side pockets for tools or whatever you want.  The material is great and also the pants fit a bit loose, which I like. The material doesn't chafe you, but you can tell it can stand up to wear and tear.  If you are a hard-on-clothing sort of person, then buy these pants.  You won't regret it."
beautiful and works well
Price good~confy.perfect!
"Love this little outfit, it's so darn cute. The shirt is really soft, too. <3"
Love this shirt!! So soft and comfy!
"Its cute, exactly like the pic. True to size. I shouldve gotten a small."
"Got this for my niece for Christmas, and she loved it!! Very, very cute!!"
Spectacular!! It looked like I had spent hundreds of dollars. The packaging was classy and it sparkled so beautifully. My Mom has worn it everyday since she received it. The fact that it is adjustable was perfect because it allowed us to size it down for her small wrist. Win Win
These leggings were nice. I bought two pairs. I wore them with silk thermals under and they felt like they were sliding so I recommend wearing them alone.
Super cute fit perfectly all I had to do was steam it and go!
Most people will assume this is white gold.  I've been wearing it for two weeks and it hasn't tarnished.  It is not uncomfortable. So when you consider the price; it's great.
"I am between sizes 10 and 12 and pear-shaped. The XXXL fit perfectly. This looks like a nice dress! Quality is pretty good and now I can swim AND be decent at the same time, without wearing the annoying and heavy boarding shorts I am used to."
"Well made as others have noted. Not for cold weather. I live in southern Cal so works for here. The main function is to cover your torn Pink Floyd T-shirt and sweats so you look decent in the morning. My wife and use them to paly Lucy and Ricky Ricardo. We stick chalk into the ends of McDonald straws and pretend they are cigarette holders. We twirl around the house I laugh, Haaa haaa ha, she wines, waa, waaa. Good times."
This jewelry box was a gift for my 4 year old great niece and she loves it!
To small... Believe I've added on some weight and my older pairs just slowly stretched. Giving it 5 stars as the material was nice and the seller returned it promptly.
My girlfriend and i both love these. Great quality. Good buy.
This is a great purchase! Size fits perfect and I got the package in as little as 2 or 3 days. It's so worth it!
"I bought this for my daughter for a birthday gift because I had bought one for myself and I really love it. It helps to keep your credit cards organized but most of all it keeps them safe. I also love the extra zipper section where you can keep money, gift cards, etc. It is a well made wallet and  a very good price. All in all if you are debating on whether to buy it I would highly recommend it to everyone."
I bought these for my daughter who needed some dressier boots for work and church.  They are working quite well.
"Beautiful color ,excellent material, and well made. The top of the dress was somewhat large but the rest of the gown fit very well. A very flattering style. Loved the train of the dress. Perfect length and material flowed well. Great value and price."
I got lot of compliments for the dress on Halloween and even won a costume contest. I would have given five stars if the zipper didn't break.
Fit is perfect. Comfort is a 10. Look is sleek and rather elegant.
"this hat makes me look like a housewife and I'm obsessed. every time i wear it, i get complimented"
Product is faux leather it is constructed well but the material scuffed the head of the hitachi and left a black mark on it with its first use. For the price it does the job its intended to do. Seller is fast shipping.
Medium fit great 128lbs 5'4. Short but not boy short cut like I have read on other reviews.
Gorgeous sweater. Light weight and very well made. Fits perfectly. Bought this for my granddaughter to wear over her Easter dress and I am so glad I did because it is so nice.
"This is a pretty dress, but order up if you're looking for something that isn't short. One wash (and hung to dry) shrunk this 3"". Picture cheap t shirt material. Order up two sizes"
"Purchased for my grandson for his bday. He absolutely loved it. Fits adults and children. Shipping was fast, and item was just as explained. Thanks!!!"
this shirt was for my father who served in the Korean war.. so hats off.. badass shirt.. death from above.. he loves the t- shirt.. proud to wear! looks good on him too!!
"This skirt is much cuter than I expected, to be honest. I am looking for excuses to wear it all the time! It fits well and is the perfect length. The fabric is a thick spandex/polyester mix and is surprisingly aoft and warm. It looks great over a pair of leggings with a nice blouse. Be sure to follow thw suze chart in the item description and you should have no problems. It arrived sooner than the projected time as well, which is a huge bonus! I purchased this product for a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
Most wet suits run way small this one is right on.
Best quality underwear
"This backpack is small but it holds so much. I used it in Disney world because it was so light weight, and I use it as a purse. It fits my iPad Pro, wallet, makeup bag and keys perfectly."
"This shirt has a silky feel to it, and the lines lend a slimming look that's quite flattering. It is well made and has stood up to several washes already without damage. This is one of my favorite shirts, and I plan to order more -- if they have other colors I like."
The fit is just right and they are super comfortable. I wear them all the time when the weather is cool. Highly recommend.
Stylish and comfortable. The stretch is nice. Would buy more from HOMEYEE.
"THIS MINT COLOR IS JUST FABULOUS!!!!! I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PARTICULAR HANDBAG IN OTHER COLORS, BUT I REALLY LOVE THIS MINT. AS FAR AS THE HANDBAG ITSELF YOU CAN DRESS IT UP OR DOWN. IT IS ROOMY AND HAS FEET ON THE BOTTOM WHICH I ALWAYS WANT OUT OF MY BAGS. AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT!"
"These dresses are just right for summer, the material is soft and like a thicker tee shirt material. I'm 5'4"" 38C and it hits me almost 2"" above my knees with a medium. I'm probably between a med and large, but I think the armholes on a large might be gaping, the medium is perfect."
It is very pretty. I have only worn it once so I can't really review it
It's hard to find slips for little girls Just wish this had adjustable straps then would be 5 star.
Got these for the grandkids.  They loved them.
Fit was true to size.  A cute & comfortable pair of flip flops.
"I love the look and fit of these shoes! They look very polished with a pair of dress pants
and look great with jeans as well. Never a break in point-they felt great from the first
wear right out of the box. Thank you Amazon!"
"good material
quality product

I am happy"
these shoes are well made and not light weights. the leather is good quality and the construction is excellent and the shoelaces look cool and stay tied. but these things really fit perfectly on my foot. i use them for hiking and biking and all around casual wear. i have problems finding wide shoes but these are exactly what i was looking for. i now have a second pair of these and still think they are excellent shoes.
This is the 2nd one of these that my daughter owned. Lasted a long time. This was the best price in the market. Great price. Slow shipping
"These pants came in about an inch and a half too small and around the waist and a bit short for my son. They were also tight and a bit short. He normally wears a size 8-10 in Levis, Cherokee and other brands and he requires a belt and suspenders with those. So I was surprised when they came in and they were small on him.

We are sending these back tomorrow. The material and cut appears to be durable and they look great! We definitely plan on purchasing a few pairs in the next size up once the refund goes through."
Perfect and snug! Exactly what I was hoping for!!!
Well made. Go one size up.  Machine wash cold inside out.  Line dry. Still fits.
fit my 2.5 year old great...he is @ 31 lbs
"I normally wear a size medium in dresses. I'm 4'11 and 118 in weight. I wear size 7 in pants and size small/medium in tops. At first I ordered a size large since the description said it runs small. The size large was way to big for me. I went back online and debated a while if I should order the medium or small. After reading other reviews I decided to return the large and reorder in a  small. The small fit perfect except that it was too long. However after hemming the dress it was a perfect fit! The material is super soft and stretchy too. I love this dress! Just as other reviewers had mentioned I also, wish it came in other colors."
well made bracelet...a bit stinky but nice otherwise
"Very nice, well made . Would definitely recommend!!"
My husband loves how comfy these are. He also loves the color they are.
"Good Quality,awesome design, light weight , luxury look and comfort feel.
I like it too much.
Thanks for great product."
We already had sleet this month and these boots kept her feet dry and toasty. Plus she likes the way they look. Fit is as expected. Just make sure you buy one size larger since these are hard rubber and won't flex one bit.
The bathing suit is beautiful but I am a L/XL and I needed the 4X in this suit. It runs extremely small.
Works great the bits are screw on so they stay in place very easy to use I have a large Invicta and works great.
Nice and a good price but outback makes better ones that are waterproofed
Love the expandable waist
"It's simple yet beautiful! Love it!
Good quality and will hopefully keep her credit cards safe. Thanks! Al"
"My grandmother loves these.  She wasn't thrilled about the ""wild"" colors (please start offering an all beige or all white pack!), but says they make up for it by being so comfortable and holding up so well in the wash."
Beautiful piece. Really worked for my costume.
"I have a wide foot and a very high instep. Add to that my need for custom orthotics and it's fair to say I have a challenging fit.

These walkers entirely meet my needs. I couldn't be happier.  I hope New Balance continues to produce this shoe for a good long time."
As described ... haven't had to use them as of yet.
"Fit well, granddaughter like it very much"
Very Comfortable walking sandal.
Very adorable for my daughter's Halloween costume (scarlet witch) she loves it and it looks like it will keep her warm and be useful for every day situations in fall and spring.
"These are fantastic!! They are my new go-to evening and weekend pants. I love them so much, I ordered another pair in the grey. I am most definitely going to order another pair in the black in the not too distant future because they are that wonderful! I cannot recommend these enough! Everyone needs a pair of these pants!"
Christmas gift. Kinda boring but my husband killed his other watch and thinks this one will be a good replacement.
My son like the Russell Hooded to wear at work.
"These are so cute, and I get many compliments on them."
Beautiful dress. Great quality material.  Dress looked the same as it did in the pictures.
"I was looking for a swim shirt that would protect me when snorkeling and this fit the bill.  I usually avoid white products as they don't seem to protect as well and they discolor easily, but I have a purple with white dots swimsuit and I wanted a shirt that didn't look bad with it.
The shirt fit snugly, which is something I want in a swim shirt.  When you are snorkeling (or just swimming even) you dhave not want a loose shirt flopping around. I have large upper arms and the shirt was comfortable.
I snorkels for well over an hour - probably close to two hours- and my back was protected.  No sunblock to damage the reef and no sunburn for me.  Win win."
"I loved wearing this necklace. It came just as expected. However, after a few months of wearing, the clasp broke. I contacted the company, and the immediately offered to send me a new one free of charge. How great! I'm so impressed."
"When I first saw this shirt I just had to laugh. I love watching the Big Bang Theory and I knew my husband would love this shirt.
The shirt fits very true to size, also.
The shirt has the rock, paper, scissors graphic on the front and the words on the back.
The material is pretty soft and comfortable, and so far the colors and printing have looked great after a few times in the washer and dryer.
I am going to have to get some more of these shirts for Christmas gifts this year.
If you have  a Big Bang fan on your list, then definitely consider this tee shirt!
*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
cute bag. Do not over pack the bag!
hard to keep the hood over your face for too long...is just a bit claustrophobic...
Puma run small for children. the mesh material is great. Just need to order like a half size up
Purchased as a stocking stuffer. They arrived sooner than expected and I was impressed with the quality for the price.
"My wife loves these big robes to wear on cold mornings. It's not sexy....but she likes it. Happy wife, happy life."
"I really like this jacket.  It's a snug fit as I expected from this kind of jacket but it is still comfortable.  It's stylish and does keep me nice and warm.  Maybe not for every occasion but I'd say if you think you want this kind of jacket, you won't be disappointed by this one."
Very comfortable and great for work.
"Cute, bought for my sporty sister; she liked it"
These feel slightly large.  If I were in a shoe store I would wantt to try on a shoe 1/2 size smaller.  I have not tried them with socks and I intend to wear them this winter.  they also make my feet look longer.
These sandals run too big - i ordered a size 9 and it looked like i was wearing my bf's shoes. I forgot to read the reviews. I'm going to order in a size 8 next time.
"Purchased the size 4 for my 4 year old grandson.  It fit him very nicely and he still has room to grow. I love it and he loves it because he can snap the snaps on the shirt much more easily than trying to button those tiny buttons on most boy's dress shirts.  He was very proud and felt most accomplished. Though it has snaps, it works nicely as a Sunday dress shirt.  The dark plaid takes away from a cowboy/western look. The collar is a little stiff even after washing but not enough for him to complain or even notice.  Would definitely buy another one in another color."
"Exceedingly comfortable with a great fit.  These are hard to find in stores, but are my favorite pants!"
i love this it keeps my jewelery clean and organized and i can see what's what. great product
Good quality and beautiful. I like it.
This sweater is so cute! It is a nice heavy material and a great price! I wish I would have ordered a size up (to a medium) to have the sweater a little baggier since it does run a tad small.
"OK I love these.  I am plus-sized and have truly HUGE calves.  I want to be able to wear big scrunchy socks with boots, but most of them don't fit around my calves, or the ones that do are uncomfortable in the foot part.  These do fit around my calves!  And with these, I can wear my regular comfy socks, and then tuck these into my boots and no one would ever know that they were leg warmers and not socks.

I ended up buying 5 pairs of these in all different colors, and may be back for more.  I just got them, so I can't yet attest to the durability, but since they aren't socks they shouldn't have to get washed too often so I'm hoping they'll last a long time."
"They are the most comfortable shoes, great colors. Tight fit, I should have ordered at least 1/2 size larger, especially if wearing socks."
"Love this ring, one of the best ""cheap rings"" and fits very true to size!"
super sexy and very nice. hugs your body and fits very nicely
"Great quality, soft, great design and true to size."
I bought this bag to bring extras home on the plane from a trip to NY.  Good quality bag and it's big.  Love it.
"the perfect small purse, with plenty of pockets for organizing"
"my grand baby is just 1 yr-she is petite, and we will only get  a few wks. out of this outfit-shorts could be a softer material, and have more give, but it is a sweet outfit."
"I love carhartt scrubs! They stretch well so if you need to bend down they never stop your movement (everyone who has worn non-stretchy scrubs know what I am talking about), they wick moisture well so fluids don't really sink in which I love"
"Many reviews suggested ordering a size up.  I am usually a small and I bought a medium, which I am very happy with.  The shirt is tight and a bit low cut, which I like, but I'm glad it's not too tight or small.  Good quality and nice color shirt."
It fit my husband comfortably. The colour was perfect too. My only complaint is the material used to make the white stripes and the Adidas name. I expect it will come off over a short amount of time. But everything else on it seems high quality. Time will tell.
"Beautiful, softest socks ever!"
These pants were discontinued for 3-4 years.  They are back now.
These15-20 mmHg knee highs fit well with good support.  The color is much darker than any beige I have seen before.  They are more like a very dark Cinnamon color
"The socks slipped on extremely easy from the first time I opened them. After a few times of wearing them, they have yet to lose any elasticity.
They're thin, but not too bad. I would say, however, that sometimes my foot slides in my shoe when I'm walking.

My feet are just above a 9.5, so I have to wear a 10 to keep it safe. These socks tend to make my feet slide around a bit in my shoe, so I would be aware of this when getting these. It's no fault of the sock; they feel great and slide on and off with ease while still sticking to the shape of my leg."
"I bought this for my husband, who is a woodworker. The design is beautiful and I love the fact that it looks like silver or white gold. The grooves with the gold color makes it a two-tone without the yellow being overwhelming. The ring fits my husband beautifully. He loves the comfort fit design because it's just that - comfortable. The price was so very reasonable. I only wish you made a 4mm version so I could get a matching one."
"The combination is easy to change if you're coordinated :) I love the way you can lock it in several different ways.  Haven't actually used it through an airport yet.  I figured if TSA opens it, the lock won't be as easy to lose since you can hook one side of it to the handle of the suitcase.  The long loop can be removed if you want to use it as a regular lock.  I think it's a great idea."
"color is exact!

fits perfect!

flawless!

I will be ordering more and DO recommend this seller....If I had to complain it would be that I wish the shirts were tag less."
"UPDATE : more than 1 year later, after countless wearing, playing, staining and washing my now 4 yo almost 5 boy is still loving and wearing them. The shirt did not lose its shape at all and the colors are still great ! they are just less bright !! Im happily surprised ! I have an other younger boy and Im happy to know I will be able to use them for him too !!!! Great buy !

My 3 yo boy just loves this t shirt ! I bought him a beige and a blue one and he wants to wear them all the time !
The fabric is nice and the colors don't fade after the washes. They didn't shrink neither. Very good for us then !!!"
"Ordered this for a costume, it's actually really cute. I'm using it for a space suit but I can see that it would also be great for Supergirl.  Nice material."
"I love this jean, the good quality of Lee."
"I love the style but it was very tight. I like fitted styles, but I had to return this one."
"Introduced in the 1960s, braided Perlon straps are a great slip-on watch strap for tropic climes and temperatures. They wash easily, regain their shape with a little massaging, and can complement any watch in various colors. They're a great addition for dive watches in summer, and adapt to water sports very well due to their quick drying qualities.

This Wrist and Style braided strap is good, not as fine a weave as Eulit Kristall Perlon braided straps, possibly like their Panama braid (I don't have one to compare). The buckle is a solid, heavy work of art, but not curved so the strap forms a little bump under the shirt cuff; it's not a problem under a dress shirt. The heat finishing on each end is a bit crude (I had to re-trim the buckle end on mine with a small butane heat gun), but does not easily fray. The fabric keeper is a very snug fit on the single thickness of the strap, and makes it hard to get the point through it on my wrist. I hope this will be remedied with repeated use. WAS could stand to assemble the keepers around two thicknesses of strap as they are meant to be used. (I slide the keeper under the short, buckle end so that I don't have the keeper against my skin. Otherwise the keeper would have to accommodate 3 layers of strap.)

This style of buckle allows adjustment of the strap length from buckle to point, even though the braid allows infinite fastening points. To reduce wear and tear on the same place you put the tongue, you can adjust the strap a little from week to week. I also gently wash these straps in tepid water, rinse and towel dry after wearing, to prolong the lifetime. WAS' strap shows little signs of wear after a few weeks of use and care, and holds up to to even a larger 42mm dive watch.

N.B. Amazon's fulfillment mislabeled a 22mm black strap as 20mm dark grey, so I received the wrong strap. WAS promptly sent me a replacement at no charge. Thanks, guys!"
I'm normally a 6.5 in Nine West but my toes were super crammed in these and I think it's because it's a higher heel than I normally buy. I really love how sophisticated these look and how classic they are!
"Save yourself the time and frustration -- just buy a stainless steel chain to put it on. The pendant is great, looks really cool, and is just the right size. The chain it came on, though? Flimsy almost beyond belief. It snapped within a day of owning it. There are a wealth of stainless steel chains available for about the same price as the pendant -- I recommend getting one (a small gauge chain, less than 1 mm, if possible) at the same time you get this pendant. But please, do get the pendant. We need subtle ways for Whovians to recognize each other."
Super cute and sooooo comfortable. Will be buying more of these...
Husband loves it.  Unconditional free return removed any apprehension I had.  It's great.  Very attractive.  Nice size. Swift shipping. Far less expensive than local department store. Snatch it up!
Great fit and comfortable! Dark blue is actually pretty bright!
These are the best hiking sandals ive ever had I used to only buy tevas not any more these arw awesome and 30 bucks cheaper than freddies I bought two pair haven't even taken the second pair out and put a couple hundred miles on em and they still look brand new. The top strap has a quick release clip so you don't need to undo the velcro after they're adjusted. Great buy. Thank you.
"Very comfortable shoe, with plenty of padding in the heel which is great for my plantar fasciitus. Would definitely buy this sneaker again."
Looks great!  Really sets off a good suit!
THERE VERY CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL.  LOOKS LIKE DIAMONDS

They are comfortable,  we'll made and absolutely adorable. The colors are very vibrant. These shawls are light weight and very ""flowy"". They will go great with a nice pair of jeans or as a cover up for swim wear.

"Good glasses. The lenses are a bit small for my 4 yr old, but still fine. We use these as the backup ""car"" pair."
"Like many American women I had no idea what my REAL bra size was until I was fitted. I walked around for years wearing poorly fitting, unflattering bras with a high band with and lower cup size (based on that obscure formula where you add 5 inches to the number and then subtract to determine bra size).  I thought I was doomed to wear Victoria Secret (VS)  if I wanted anything remotely sexy.  Don't get me wrong since there is nothing wrong per se with VS. Still, I thank my lucky stars I have not been in one since high school.

What with working out and aging and...enhancements my body has changed radically off and on over the past 15 years. Luckily I have managed to get fitted by a Pro several times which enables me to shop on line for Freya, Fantasie and Panache to name a few high quality makers of DD+ lingerie. Which means I am able shop on line and not end up with bras that fit poorly that are a hassle to return if I should happen to regret the purchase.

Other than a strapless longline I needed for a wedding once I do not really need a longline for the purpose a garment like that is intended. I just knew I wanted at least one Freya longline since I loved how sexy it looked on the model. Unfortunately after trying on the Freya longline in various patterns such as the Piper, Patsy and lastly the Flourish it became sadly apparent I was not going to end up with one. I was uneasy with the amount of forward projection this bra created. I did not like the silhouette or overall shape it created with clothing. It looked great without clothes but with clothes it kind of reminded me of the ""bombshell"" look of the 50's. Ew. Just Ew. Still, I feel as a low-cut, slightly padded, semi longline the bra is what it purports  to be and fit the way it was supposed to. It just wasn't me. (At. All.)

** On the brighter side I love the pattern so I ended up buying the Flourish Underwire Plunge Balcony Bra 1541 in Black. :)

**I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who reminds us that when you size down in the band you must remember to go up in the cup  Size can also vary by brand/manufacturer
Here's this from elsewhere
Go down a sister size: Reduce your band size by two, but take your cup size up one interval.
For instance, you might go from a 36 D to a 34 DD
Go up a sister size: Increase your band size by two, but go down one cup size. For instance, you might go from a 36 F to a 38 E (DDD)"
"I bought these for winter at our wind site. It kept my feet warm in -20F as long as I kept moving. I also took them hunting this winter, and they are comfortable to hike around in as well. For a smaller person, they're not as lightweight as everyone seems to profess. When you're climbing 300+ ft every day, every little ounce feels like a pound.

My only gripe would be that the rubber on the toe has started peeling a little bit, but only the outside edge by the stitching. The black leather (?) has also started cracking around the toe area where it bends. I suppose if I oiled them occasionally it might prevent that, but it's not a huge issue. I just walked through 4"" deep mud/water puddles without having any water intrusion - feet are perfectly dry and warm.

They're a great boot, very roomy, and comfortable. Didn't really have any break-in period that I can remember. I've been wearing them for the last 6 months and they're holding up just fine."
"I bought this as a impulse but for My boyfriend on Christmas. He already has two coats, a leather jacket for cold days and a pea coat for really cold days. However, we live in Colorado, and a day that starts off chill can turn to a scorcher and a day that starts off pleasant can become less so with just the right amount of wind. So he needed an in-between jacket; one for the transitional seasons of spring where he could have a light weight jacket that keeps the chill off. This jacket works very nicely. It is sturdy, and could be used as a camping jacket while still being streamlined enough to look stylish in the city.

He's a picky guy when it comes to styling, but he liked the subdued color as well as the raised seams that gave it a bit of punch. The sizing is good. I decided to spring and get him an xl so that if it was a brisk day he could wear a sweater under it and not feel too squished. The xl has plenty of room to bundle up in, so if your guy fills out a large tee-shirt you might consider bumping him up a size for comfort.

One critique is that it is a bit heavier that I anticipated, but not so much so that it will stop it from being a spring/fall jacket. Material will keep the wind off and it is water resistant, so I'm sure he'll be snug when he walks to his train in the morning.

Hope this helps, it was a good buy on sale, but worth the non-sale price."
This belt has changed my life!
"My six year old girl started sports and was unconfortable with her uniform but now with this underneath, she s happy and confortable. When it s very hot, we soak it in cold water and wear it like that to keep cool"
"I bought four of these belts in different colors, and I'm just going to review the red since it's the first. I'm a woman and I don't wear belts frequently, so these are just fine for my use. My waist is 30"" and I bought the smallest size available. I mainly wear one with a grey chemise-style dress, belted loosely, and with a necklace in the same color family. I also have some bermudas that are a bit too big in the waist; the belts work nicely with them. I bought these in red, blue, black, and white and those colors suit my needs and did not strain my pocketbook."
Came in a little pink bag not black super cute! As  someone with OCD the stone is a tiny bit off center but I still love it.
soft soft soft and drapey...lovely
"Super cute, thicker than I imagined but I love it. Soft and warm! The length is good, covers the tummy and I am tall, so the length of the arms is perfect."
"I don't have a wide foot but ordered ""ee"" on a hunch. Glad I did. Has more of an arch than Justin ropers and the heel is 1/4"" taller. Great boot though"
Perfect. Fits my glasses perfectly - little room to spare :( but hard case and closes firmly
GREAT SUIT! I CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR IT!
Sent this to my Step daughter who is hard to please since she has to have everything designer.  She love it  and the colors.  Good choice.
This is my go to jean.  I wear it until I get a hole in it and then I just order another.  I just wish that Amazon/Levis would stop changing the colors on me.  I always have to pick a new color every time I reorder.  You'd think there are some classic colors out there.
i love all calvin klein dresses. it fits my baby girl.
Good stockings
This product is made of great material and still remains shiny and looking like new.  It is a great addition to any jewelry
"Purchased this coat on black Friday special for $99 what a steal. the coat is warm and cozy. It runs true to size, I wear a 8-10 and the medium fit great, with room to layer. The coat is a light color black. I would highly recommend this coat."
"This is my all time favorite boot.  It is so comfortable and pretty.  It works with the cuff up or down and can be dressy or sporty.  The heel is just high enough to give some height without relegating the boot to the "" okay, I'll be sitting most of the time "" category.  I love it!"
Wonderful bunting piece for those cooler mornings and evenings that have begun. Love the color!
"Not picky daughter loved these. I gave 4 rather than 5 stars, because the zipper can be a little hard to zip. Otherwise, a nice child's boot."
They were very pretty but they ran a little small for me.
Great price and quality. Arrive quickly.
Love the shoes. Colors and quality are very nice and I know Skechers are comfy because I wear them too. My daughter loves them.
Perfect!  Exactly what I wanted and ordered and what was delivered.  I am perfectly happy!
Because of the many ways to adjust these sandals I was able to make them fit my feet.
"Got this for my niece after a friend recommended it. It is such a cute backpack. Its slightly too large for my 2 year old niece still, but she still loves to carry it around anyways. It has plenty of space and enough compartments."
"Great feel, a little narrow of a shoe. Definitely recommend getting E size or half size bigger. Excellent buy great looking shoe feels great"
not hemmed
Was a little worried about the size but it's true to fit I had it embroidered and my son loves it he wears it often and even after many washes it still fits well
Exceeded them for comfort and fit
"I love the look of these sneakers. I ordered my usual size and they fit well. The comfort level is just ok. They don't hurt at all; they're just not very cushiony and there is very little arch support. I would not recommend them for long periods of walking. The toe box is a bit shallow. I'm sure my great toe will rub through the canvas fairly quickly. I should probably subtract one star for that reason, but I'm giving them 5 stars for style and quality. I'm very happy with them!"
my husband love them!!
It fits perfectly. I ordered light grey and it will go with everything.
Fantastic luggage tags. Sturdy plastic. Vivid colors. Fast delivery. Would order again.
"Fit the bill, after first buying and returning two other pieces form other vendors. Chain is heavier than competing examples, which minimizes tangles. Excellent crystal."
"I love this shirt. It's light and comfortable, but warm. I purposely ordered mine in a larger size to wear as a normal long sleeve shirt rather than a thermal layer, but I'm already considering buying another for that purpose. The price was a little steep at first glance but I do not regret it at all now."
"I bought this ring for my coworker, who is from Louisiana.  She loves it!  It fits perfectly!"
"This outfit is so super duper cute, I love it!  My daughter is 15 months, about 31"" long, average build, and the 18mo size fits perfect."
These are very cute sandals.  Even prettier in person.  I couldn't wait to get them in the mail.  I love the color and the bling  on it and they seem very versatile and summery.  I love wearing sandals but have a hard time finding sandals that are comfortable.  These are comfortable but definitely no arch support.  They seem pretty sturdy and the buckle stays on well.  The do fit my feet a bit narrow.  My feet are a bit wide and these were snug at first.  It feels that maybe they are adjusting to my feet however my pinkie toe is confused as to where it needs to go. It wants to pop out from under the strap although that's not comfortable but my toe isn't long enough to be held in so I have to figure that one out.  The bottom is textured and rubberized to prevent slipping.  Definitely pretty sandals for the price.  I did get these for a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
"Very comfy. I like the flexibility, not like others that are stiff and have to break in."
Too small! I normally wear size 8. I bought size L and it turned out to be too small
These earring were purchase for my staff as a Christmas gift. I have 2 members that are allergic to lots of metals but these they wear faithfully. They are perfect sizes for any occasions. I would recommend this product of you are looking for a fantastic set of earring and a fantastic price.
"It is a nice slipper, but everyone needs to beware when ordering!  The sizing is way off.  My husband has worn this type of slipper [and size] for more than 30 years and absolutely loves it.  When I ordered the slipper from this manufacturer, it was way too small in both length and width and I had to return and reorder which added to my cost.  While Amazon was very easy to work with, it was frustrating and disappointing on Christmas Day."
Classy shoe fits great
this shirt is amazing I thought this would be like other band shirts I have bought and this one looks just like tony stark took it off his back.  Fit is amazing emblem is perfect and the shirt is so so soft.  I wish all my other shirts were like this
"I am so in LOVE with this dress!!! It is extremely flattering and so fun and easy to use. The material is high quality and heavy,it fits like a glove. I'm 5'2 and 125lbs, and although it states one size fits all, I would have to say that this dress is probably going to be most flattering on small and medium sizes. It may be too big for a very petite woman and not as flattering for a larger woman because the fabric will show some imperfections. I'll be buying another one!"
adorable for the price paid almost as much in shipping
Pearl arrived as expected.  Looks just like in the picture.  It was a gift for my wife to replace one that was stolen.  She likes it a lot.  Very attractive piece.
"I love this sweater; the fit is perfect and I get compliments frequently.  Only complaint is I think this won't be a long-term item, as i noticed the material is pilling near the the underarms from normal movement / friction after just 2 wears.  I wash inside out on gentle and flat dry hoping to make it last longer."
"I purchased the Louises in the Burgundy color directly from the Doc Martens website. The Louises are normally quite expensive but I snagged them during a 70% off sale. I must say that I had a pleasant transaction and the boots arrived quickly without problems or defects. There is an inner zipper which makes them easy to take on and off. The heel looks imposing but isn't; they are easy to walk in. I wear a solid US Size 9 and the UK 7 fit perfectly. It was not too narrow for me, nor was it too wide. The design of the Louise is marvelous and chic. I love the heel, especially with the Burgundy color. I receive compliments each time I wear them. They are easy to clean and do not need to be polished since the outside of the boot is coated with a smooth varnish.

The only issue I have with the Louise boot is that they are not as comfortable as my other high-heeled Docs. I find that the longer I walk in them, the more the ball of my foot begins to become tender. I don't think they have as much cushioning as my other Docs do, but that can be rendered easily enough by purchasing a cushion. Other than that, there are no rubs elsewhere and they are stunning to wear out. Both men and women love them. I included two pictures that I uploaded to the image section."
could be a tad less tight
"I love this item , I had to wear a neck collar and it was wide enough to cover it."
"I received this necklace earlier than expected
.It's a great necklace and I get complimented a lot when I wear it."
"Not the best quality, but it does the job! Im a 32C, 115lbs. It holds up alright and works well with my low cut tops."
Very pretty. Better than expected.
"I bought these for my wife because she doesn't have ""any cute socks for boots"". They came in a few days ago and other than them being a smudge small, they're great! They keep her legs warm and they have a nice design to them.
She would recommend these to any lady who needs good cute boot socks
I received this item at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review."
"I just love this little dress! It is great for summer and late spring. I would advise that you pay attention to the sizing chart - I am normally a small. I am about 5 foot tall and weight 120-125 lbs. I purchased a small after some careful consideration. It fits fairly well right now, but if I gain weight it will end up looking too tight. This looks really cute on! I would recommend pairing it with flats, sandals, wedges, as well as a belt. A long or short necklace would be adorable if you paired it with this dress. Additionally, I thought this dress was really comfortable and I could wear it all day.

This little dress is affordable enough that you could purchase it in different colors, too. You could wear this to multiple occasions and either dress it up or down, depending on where you were going. Being that it is so versatile, that really increases the value ten fold! Love this and I am very happy with my purchase overall!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest & unbiased opinion."
"Great vest, nice quality!"
"it's a good shaper, I am content with it"
"I got this to be part of a siren/mermaid costume, and it was perfect for its purpose. The jewelry is of course very light and fake, but it did not appear to be cheap costume jewelry. Achieved desired effect. :)"
"I like these tennis sneakers a lot, but they are not as light weight as I expected, I am getting used to the weight each time I play."
Great OCR shoe. Wore these shoes for the Spartan Beast in Tahoe and they drained great and held up.
"This hat is absolutely adorable and so versatile! It started fitting my daughter when she was about three months, it is too big for a newborn - but we love it!"
Great volleyball shoe. Very comfortable to play with. Very recommended
"Shipping was fast, I was impressed with it. Took 3 days total from ordering. The color is right and it was a great price. I just needed a lightweight robe I could toss on quickly.
There's 2 reasons for the rating, one: yes, I get that it's cheap and not real silk or anything like that, but it feels rough and almost like it's been starched, I'll see if washing it a few times with some fabric softener helps. It's definitely not silky on your skin. The second reason is that it's long, hits the model at just above her knee. That was the length I was hoping for. Falls to about an inch under my knees. Granted, I'm short (5ft even), but the waistline is right where it should be. I expected the length to be there as well."
Husband really likes these shoes. He said they are truly waterproof. He goes disc golfing all the time and says they are comfortable.
Excellent product - good service
"I just received these ""Diamond"" earings today...They shine, sparkle and dazzle like real diamonds. 1.5 carat each would cost at least $10,000 each
if it was a real diamond. You could not tell apart these cubic zirconia stones from real diamond stones. Amazing value at $16 including tax !"
I had to use a shoe stretcher to make them fit
Good looking belt that is functional.
I bought the Adidas Big Boy's Defender Performance Short. It looks good. Fits well. It's comfortable and my son loves it. Kind of hard to say much more.
"These shoes fit like you would expect a pair of Vans to fit, color was nice, and they are easy to get on and off."
"Since it's summer I haven't had the opportunity to wear these boots that much, but I am very please with them overall. The calf area is a little tighter than I expected and the leather a little thinner. However they are very warm and fairly durable."
"When you want to install a video security system but don't want to deal with wires, this is the perfect solution. I've been able to place my cameras all over the house without any issues. Suddenly changing my mind on what room I would like the camera in is not a problem thanks to the wireless system.

The battery life has been great. I kept the recordings at the lowest settings with 20 second clips whenever t detects motion. The quality of the video is still great, and it has been 5 weeks now since I've installed the system and the battery indicator still says full on all the cameras. Whether the battery indicator is accurate is another thing.

So far I love the system. It has provided me with the security I wanted for my home without the hassle of the install. I'll update this review later down the line once it has seen more rain and weather changes."
A+. Great shirt
Good boot. Happy with purchase.
Son wears it daily.  Army man every day.  Lol
Good for surfing. Fit is as expected.
"Reasonably priced, awesomely comfortable (says my wife - the wearer of these).  Non-slip sole is great as well.

They're super plush and warm - what she needs.  Really colorful, like the design I selected.  Nothing negative to say about these puppies."
Bought them for my son. He likes them and is very active in them and they hold up.
"These were exactly as described. They are a great addition to my spring wardrobe, the colors are great. I'm happy with them."
These earrings are really cute and I'm glad they aren't too small.
One of my favorite pieces.  Always wanted a tulle skirt.  This can be worn casual or dressy either way it's cute.
"Great, but I'm a tall gal and these were a bit too short for me.."
"I love these boots, can wear them on a 12 hour work day easy and I am on my feet all day"
very nice chain -just wish it would have been a bit larger
Love these shoes for my 6 year old girl. Size is true to size. My daughter loves the colors and patterns of the Skechers twinkle toes line. These shoes hold up well too with all the playing my 6 year old does in them.
"wish the material was different, but still really like it."
This is a great shoe. It is very comfortable to wear with it's memory foam foot bed. I am very happy with this shoe and will buy again in the future when needed. I work as a physical therapist and am on my feet constantly for 10hrs a day. It is so comforting for me to have every step I take feel like i'm stepping on marshmallows. My feet don't hurt at the end of the day and thats great. Skechers has other shoes that feel the same way because I tried out a handful of them but decided to go with this style and color. The stamina cutback is another skechers shoe that feels like this one does and looks great. The price is right on these shoes also.
"as expected, I already have a pair before"
"Like walking on air!  I didn't realize when I ordered these shoes that they had a velcro closure.  I missed that in the description.  Imagine trying to open the buckle and then the entire buckle coming open - LOL  Anyway, these shoes are extremely comfortable.  I absolutely love them and highly recommend them to anyone looking for tennis shoes comfort in the look of a shoe!"
"I ordered this for my almost-teen and she loves it. The chain is a little shorter than we expected, but it looks nice on her. Although small, the Amethyst is pretty, as is the heart. The necklace looks delicate and classy. The only drawback is the thickness (or lack of) of the chain. It's so thin that I'm not sure how long she'll go without breaking it."
"I really enjoy Social D.  Been listening to them for years.  A nice T-Shirt to express my enjoyment sure seemed like a good idea, and you don't see many around.  It's a good quality, comfortable shirt with a nice screenprinting job on it.

But the compliments?  Unexpected.  I've gotten more compliments on this shirt than on any shirt I've worn in years.  Not sure why, but apparently it sticks out."
"Super cute, a little big for new borns, but he'll grow into it in no time at all.  Makes middle of the night changings way easier!"
"I love this wallet, however if you fill every card slot the wallet will look bulky.  The wallet is well made and the color is beautiful."
"I picked up a 6pk of these an of Dickie's -which supposedly is a more feature rich sock.

Fresh out of the pack, they feel fine. I didn't notice any issues with the stitching at the toes, which is why I was looking for a different sock brand for work as my HANE'S are just unbearable at the toes.

They unfortunately were not on the same level as the Dickie's I picked up, but I'm not displeased with my purchase of Gold Toe at this point in time. I will see how these fair me after the first and several washes later, if they over time develop issues and deterioration sooner than I'd consider acceptable."
Excellent shoe. I highly recommend it.
"I love this beanie! I literally wore it almost every day last winter. It has held up perfectly and was the perfect thickness for our late night ice skating around the holidays. The fit was great, and it is probably the only beanie I have ever owned that doesn't fall off when I wear it a little further back. I also ended up buying it in purple, black, burgundy, grey, and taupe. The light rose color is slightly more mauve then pictured on the computer, but it is still a very pretty color. I let my roommate wear it one day, and the next week she had ordered 2 for herself. Just as a heads up.... it's not SUPER slouchy as described, but more of just a comfortable fit that's a little loose and not tight against your head like other beanies."
"Got these today.  After reading some reviews, I was not ready for what I pulled out from the package.  I have been trying to get true wet look black leggings for a while and all I could find were the heat treated variety, and these have been of low quality with bad seams.  I was hoping these were different.  When I pulled these out of their package I was greeted by leggings of a slick matt black appearance that was NOT heat treated lycra like the others.  These looked like the real deal.  As stated in one review these fit better without underwear, so after really look them over, I took everything off and began the process of getting these on.  Sat down, and was pleasantly surprised to find the leg cuff fairly easily went over my foot with just a bit of tugging.  But as I pulled the leg up I knew this would not be easy.  It took A LOT of work to put these on without tugging too hard.  You have to drag you fingers up the material to get it where it needs to go.  Once on though....WOW!!!  Skin tight, except at the knees it seems, but that is not too awful.  They feel awesome to wear if a bit restricting in movement.  The waistband goes just over your naval. They do feel great minus underwear, and yes if you did have those on you would see their seams.  These will be hot thermally to wear though, as they are coated lycra...also the material may not hold up...only time will tell.  I will likely be getting another pair of these, maybe in large (I am 6ft, 32 waist, 155 pounds, and med fit really well, and large might be easier)"
"Bought these for my boyfriend so that he could experience a pair of nice merino socks for the first time ever. He brags everytime he wears them because he loves them so much. He is saving up to buy several more pairs, as well as some lighter weight ones for summer.

Also- his feet are a lot less smelly when he wears these than they are with cotton socks!! XD"
I don't know what it is about these that my husband loves but he does. There is no other hat he wears but these. He swears they fit very snug and do not stretch over time so that is a huge plus.
I like them a lot but used socks at least the first time.... True fit don't go up or down!
A great watch with fun extras!
I love this belt! It's simple and very pretty with a vintage look to it. I'm sure it'll be one of my favorites. I would recommend this product to any woman who likes simple elegance.
Beautiful for my daughter
"Looks great wears great.

Love the 1984 album shirt."
Great product!! Just as pictured.
All I can say is that these boots are awesome and I would definitely buy them again.
Great product!  Fits awesome
"Beautiful shoes! I ordered the Ivory color. There is some ivory in the band, but also some brown and black. I can see these going well with several different outfits. These look exactly as pictured and feel of good quality. I usually wear a 9.5 or a 10. I read the other reviews that these are slightly large so I decided to order a 9.5. They fit perfectly! I can tell the 10 would have been too big. I was worried about the ankle strap because my ankles are on the wider side, but again they fit perfectly. They are also very comfortable. I will be wearing them to work and I walk a lot. I plan to order more!"
"Really like this shirt, but very baggy around the neckline and the shirt is fairly baggy as well. Looks best with a cardigan or hoodie, not just by itself."
Surprising great fitt
Perfect color for summer. Very comfortable.
I love these flip flops!  I bought a pair when I went to a Croc store while vacationing in Maui a year ago.  A couple months ago I wore them to the hospital when I was in labor and they disappeared and I was so upset!  The Croc website no longer sold them and so I came to Amazon to look for them and thank goodness I found them!  Very comfortable.  Highly recommended.
I purchased 3 of these.  Great little change purse.
Great product. Comfy. Has a nice inner lining on the front. My only complaint: Why on earth do they not sell a black three-pack?
Great pants! Hard to find a fat guy size in 40x29.
"Great pants! i'm 5' 4'', 125 lbs, athletic, and got a size 3. Fits well, looks just like the picture. Pretty thin material, not jean-like, like I was expecting. So, it's a little surprising they cost as much as they do. But, still like them a lot! New favorite pants. If they were $10 cheaper, I'd buy them in every color."
"Love the skirt. However, there is nothing ""eyelet"" about the fabric. It is plain cotton voile fabric with no eyelets. Also it does not come in 16 colors, so maybe that is just to entice you to look though all their products to make sure.

The edges at each tier and the bottom are not finished and get frayed with washing, but I like that style, exactly the look I wanted. The only thing that would be better about the skirt itself, is if the lining inside was a little longer. The material is the weight expected (lightweight) but still, the skirt is see-through. past the short liner. I am 5'4"" and I am fine with the length. The waistband is very stretchy and could fit anyone from small to large."
"They run a half size big by my estimation. The arch is pretty flat compared to my running shoes, but the support is still pretty good for a casual boot.

Also, the color is very very dark. Basically black."
"Great little suit, especially for the price. It's hard to find a modest suit anymore, and this one fits the bill!  I'm tempted to buy a few more so we don't have to look for weeks next time my daughter needs one..."
Adorable and great quality! This was a perfect baby gift. Nice printing and fabric. Size was as expected.
There thin but great for the price
My niece loved it! She smiled when she got it! So if she's happy so am I!
"This a great piece of luggage.  I was using an older carry on from a different company that no longer met carry on size requirements.  Got the Helium because it complies with most carriers size restrictions when not using the expansion capabilities.  This carry on is light, has great wheels and the handle is easy to use as well.  A couple things that keep it from being 5-star:
The pull handle feels cheap.  It moves and wiggles a lot.  Hoping it lasts.
In order to maximize interior space they haven't hidden the framework.  So you have to pack a bit differently to create that flat bottom to reduce wrinkles.  This isn't that big of deal though.
I'm very happy with the purchase."
"It fits perfectly. Although I have worn Bali bras for years, this is my first attempt at ordering online. My size is smaller online but the fit for Bali bras is what draws me to them. Very very happy with this bra, will order more."
"AWESOME, LOOKS AND FITS GREAT"
"Good quality, washed well"
"My mother lives in Monterey, CA and this is perfect for the Winter so I bought this, and another, for Christmas. Perfect gifts, and she feels pretty, yet warm in them."
"Might be the most comfortable bra, I've ever owned. Great under blouses and Tshirts"
"I usually have problems with strapless bras, being a woman with a larger bust, I was unsure about this bra. But it worked well, the only problem is if you sweat, it slides. It doesn't really lift, but I wasn't expecting it to either."
Wonderful fit.  Thicker than the competition. Great value.
"Nice, comfortable tank, it does have thin padding for modesty, I like that the back can be adjusted to a racerback, it does show partial cleavage though, so if you are looking for something more modest, you might want to look elsewhere."
Very comfortable sandal.  Great for hiking.  My husband and I love these sandals.  They last a long time.
"I'm not a runner so I can't help those who are shopping for that purpose. However, these shoes are terrific for walking and daily wear. They produce a kind of walking on air effect. Light in weight, but excellent arch support. I will definitely be shopping for Asics Gel shoes when these need to be replaced down the road."
"I have been wearing Vionics for a few years now and they never disappoint. Getting ready for a knee replacement soon and needed some lightweight but supportive shoes and these fit the bill. Comfortable, lightweight, supportive. I walk 3-5 miles a day with my 2 year old lab and need good shoes anyway."
I had never heard of Patty Boutik...I'm glad I ordered it...I love their clothes. I have bought about 4 tops so far.
"My mom needed a new pair of shades for the bright summer sun. This was a nice, stylish, inexpensive pair of sunglasses that looks like it will last throughout the summer at least. May not be top quality but they definitely do the job by protecting your eyes from the bright sun."
"I love this dress, I got it in the black it is well made and true to size. Shipping was faster than expected!"
Nothing fancy but funny and comfy. Fits a little smaller than expected.
"I didn't expect to like this dress, but I love it.  It's very comfortable and fits my body perfectly.  Hugs all the right places and hides all the right places.  I'm going to wear this for my son's rehearsal dinner!"
My grandson loved the fur lining and said the boots are very warm. Great news since our weather has been very cold.
"The jeans have not faded, shrunk or stretched out at all. Great pair of jeans that will stand up to the fun nature of a kid playing outside in the grass and dirt."
Bought this for my husband for our anniversary and he LOVES it.  He is not a large man and it fits his wrist perfectly.  WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!
"Great valet , only issue is it was a bit smaller then i thought it was going to be, makes me feel like a real gentalmen now"
It looks nice and it's a good quality item but it's too small to go around my wrist. My wrist is about a half an inch too big around.  It comes with a link tool but for me to wear it I need another link.
Perfect for any occasion.  Love it!
"Received  a couple months ago and have been using this overly-harsh cold & snowy winter.  They fit perfectly, I like that you can snug them around your calf before tying up, they're warm, have good traction and I think they're pretty darn cute too."
"these are some awesome shoes i started skating them around 3 or 4 months ago and they are still in shape
i recomend this product to everybody :)"
"If anyone out there has never tried these shoes, you don't know what you are missing.  they have made my work day so much easier."
"Beautiful and simple, exactly what I wanted!"
"These stockings are so pretty I wear them as often as I can.  However, they are sheer thigh highs, so you may want to be careful when (especially when putting them on) wearing them.  Other than that, I've always recommended this stockings to all my friends.  Hue is a brand I trust and I have never been dissatisfied with the quality of their hosiery.  Plus, they are amazingly comfortable and they always stay in place even through my very busy workday.  I love them and I believe you will too!"
"These sandals are super cute and comfy.  They are a little narrow, so I wouldn't recommend for people with wide feet."
Nice turtleneck. Just what I wanted.
Love elephants
They are great undershirts.  They were very long before I washed them.  They shrank to half the size and fit perfectly.
"Excellent pair of Hush Puppies - fits well, very comfortable and the color is exactly as shown. I am very happy."
"These pajama pants are great! The material is lite and comfy, the seems are nice, and they didn't shrink in the dryer! I will definitely order a few more pairs. Definitely worth buying. The price is reasonable and the shipping was fast. Awesome product and seller! :)"
"A beautiful addition to my wedding rings, even prettier than picture. In response to the reviewer who was disappointed that the luster faded, I have found with regular cleaning after many months of daily wear it still looks beautiful."
It could definitely be a little larger for more comfort!
"It's nice looking band , but it doesn't definitely fits the Moto 360 .. Unless you are willing & able to cut this hard band from the two sides that will contain the pins in the perpendicular half of the tube !!! .... This is conclusion people , I've bought the band by two deceiving answers to the question ( Does it fit the Moto 360? ) ..."
Love these they are truly oversize and protect your eyes and keep the haters out if u know what I mean lol celebrity inspired and old Hollywood glamour style beauty! Love them!! Must have for any beauty!
Nice shirt for the price.  Fit true to size.
"Quality material and Fits as expected.  My daughter loves how light a fluffy (no excessive) the skirt portion is.  She literally twirls everywhere when she wears it.

Would buy again, and I am sure in the near future as she is growing like a weed."
Very comfortable shoes I really like them.
"This brand shoe always fits my feet.  I need some arch support and the Merrell Women's Jungle Glove Canvas Slip-On has that.  I bought a pair of these to wear when I work outside in my garden because I loved my suede pair.  These I do hose off with the garden hose if they get dirty and they, like me, are happy campers plus clean when I do that.  Great shoe for walking and when I'm done in the garden, I often walk around my circle (which is a mile) and my feet and comfy."
"I needed a good Halloween costume layer that I didn't have to paint my entire body white. This served its purpose perfectly! The material is actually very strong and durable, I was able to cut out eye and mouth holes without the fabric unraveling. I would purchase this again if needed!"
Good to wear under white shorts
Wear this scarf with anything casual or fancy
"This is a nice little bag. I only wear cross-body bags so it was perfect for me. Could us more pockets though because I like to keep things handy and readily available but other than that, I was happy."
It was a great bow tie until I turned it into a head band. (Bought it for my friends Halloween costume)
"I just ordered this costume for a Halloween party in 2013. I love this thing! The quality of it is pretty good for a Halloween Costume, since most seem cheap, thin and overpriced. Speaking of price, not bad for everything being included! My only gripe is that, the sleeves are super long. I'm 6 foot and it surpasses my arm length by a long shot, you will need pins to prop the sleeves up for an appropriate length for yourself. To compliment this costume, I strongly ADVISE you a pair of white gloves to go with this.  It will complete the costume, any white gloves will do, but I bought some tuxedo gloves:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B000NFV7JU/dp/B000NFV7JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B000NFV7JU</a>

They were inexpensive and did the trick."
"I'm a minimalist runner and triathlete. I've been very selective regarding the footwear my son wears. As he his feet grow, the selection of minimalist shoes grows thinner and thinner. Unlike many brands of shoes out there the Merrell flux glove is true to the minimalist name. The sole appears to be zero drop (not a raised heel) and is very flexible (you can easily fold it in either direction. Also importantly the sole is equally flexible along the length of the shoe so it doesn't have a tendency to kink and pinch his feet. Teh rest of the shoe is very light and flexible as well. Another great feature are the material of the laces, which are in between being able to get knots untied easily and not randomly coming undone all the time. Though I recommend having your kids double knot. I feel this shoe will be a staple for my son in the coming years."
Very comfortable shoe. Fits great. Prettier than expected. Really like the material.
I was concerned about the toe type on this boot but I found it to be quite comfortable and the leather was very supple.
Great shorts for price and fit as expected.
"They resulted better that I expected. Very good fabric and fit perfectly. I would purchase them again!. You can get very good underware for just a few dollars, if you are the kind of people <no Brand Hunter>"
another cool design. I will shop again with this seller.
"My favorite running shoe, fit is perfect and the colors are great."
"My last one lasted 20 years of daily use.  How can you ask for better.  I worried that I would not be able to find one like it.  But this one is better.  The suaded one I did have stained easily.  This one is finished so that stain would merely wipe off,"
I bought these for my mom.. She loved them
Excellent watch....beautiful dial..soft leather...keeps great time...Very happy
"i bought it as a present to my honey girlfriend, it looks perfect on her feet!"
Love this robe. My cat loves it too. I can't leave it on the bed because she curls up in it. It is a nice toasty warm feeling I get when I put it on. I highly recommend this robe.
"My feet are right between 7.5 and 8. I've accepted that every shoe must be tried on in both sizes. These are really lovely. The fabric is nice, if not a little librarian looking for a 30 year old. But just too big. I should have exchanged for 7.5 since 8 was a touch too big. Oh well. SUPER COMFY though on the foot pad."
Impressed with the lightness space and function of the wheels!
"I LOVE LOVE this style, I just wished they have more colors. I don't know why there can't be burgundy, brown or even purple. I get bored by the typical generic colors Kipling always seem to have - black, grey & beige. So, I bought the sailor blue b/c ""true blue"" is dull."
"These tights are pretty good. They are great for the price and are really soft.

I was worried they would be short being OS, but they were fine on me. I was 5'7"", 135# pp and at 26 weeks I have plenty of room in these. I think even a person a few inches taller could still wear them and a bigger person could too.

They leave plenty of room for your belly, but they aren't supportive. They stay up fine though.

I ordered the gray, and I would say they are true to the color pictured. I wish they were more of a charcoal, but they are truly gray."
These shoes are so comfortable. The only downside is that they make my feet smell after only wearing them for a couple hours. This is not a problem I normally have.
so easy to put on and wash
Very quick shipping and seems to be great quality very comfortable! I usually only wear fatigues but I bought these to wear under my motorcycle chaps and I love them! I think I will buy another pair I would recommend to others
Great key chain. If your a fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas. Amust have!
I love these bras. This is my second purchase.  I will purchase more in the future.
Love Sperrys!
"OMG... I had them for all of 12 minutes and I put one in to see how it would feel and oh my goodness I already want every pair they have in every color!!  They are so soft I hurried up and took them off because I didn't want to mess them up yet there soo perfect get you some buy for grandma, friend,  cousin,  girlfriend , sister,  aunt, hey anybody there amazing and there affordable it's a win in my eyes! the inside feel like your walking on a cloud  very cute too in going to wear them everywhere and buy more "
"I've been searching for comfortable rain boots for a long time.  These definitely fit the bill.  I have wide feet, and these boots are very roomy in the toe box area, without pinching at the heel.  I ordered a size up and that was good.  Love the cute patterns and colors."
"Great price, fantastic detail, nice size.  Very happy with this purchase!"
I was a bit thrown off by the reviews but decided to order one size up. She usually wears a size 14. I ordered a size 16....it fits perfectly! We decided on the yellow....gorgeous!
This is my third pair of the ghost series.  The quality and the fit continue to meet my expectations.
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE!! SO COMFY.."
Easy to clean and use!
Such a soft feel and it reminds me of a soft blanket. It fits over my shoulder nicely.
Must have for a Zelda fan. Good quality and comfortable
"I love these flip flops! I have several pairs of Sanuk's, and they are most comfortable. I can wear them all day, and have never had a problem. This is my go to brand for flip flops as they work well on sand and cement."
great balance and very cute
"Just my size, big collar, tall, long sleeves. Not so easy to find especially at this price point, will buy again."
"I had been looking for ankle boots for about 2 years.  My old ones were really old.
I saw these boots, bought them and an totally happy with them."
"I initially purchased this bracelet for myself, but I ended up giving it to my son.  It was a little small for my wrist, but it fits my son nicely.  It is a very handsome design.  The build quality seems to be solid, but only have had it for a few weeks.  For the quality and the price, this is definitely a must buy."
"I bought these for my husband to run in.  He liked them so much,  he asked for a couple more pairs. He is 6 foot 2 and 190 lbs.  I bought a size  large,  and they stay up, are long enough, and are comfortable for running or lounging."
"I recommend ordering 1/2 size larger, if you plan on wearing thick socks with it. It has a nice wider heel for stability."
VERY long! Goes to almost hips. Quality is good and not costume-synthetic-shiney.
lots of room. survived Airlines
These sports bras are very comfortable.  A great buy for the money!
"I bought them for my 13 yo daughter and she loves them.  The 9 yo also said ""those are really cool"".  Not sure that she's tried it in the cold yet but it worked fine inside with the gloves on."
"Bought this as a gift. Nice fabric, pretty style, true to size. Looks like it will was beautifully too. Very happy with my purchase"
"This is such a great deal! Love how you can change the size of the belt without having to use a buckle and have all the extra belt just hanging around. The color combo is beautiful and looks perfect with dresses. Unless you have super tiny hips, these belts are only meant for your waist with dresses and not your hips with pants."
"We bought this for my 11 month old daughter. She will be just over a yr old come Halloween and weighs roughly 30lbs and this fits her great! It mayyyyy be a little snug if she is wearing a sweater and bulky bottoms but its also very warm so a thinner shirt and bottoms would probably be fine to wear under this (and we live in Central NY). My daughter has a HUGE head lol and the hat is a liiiittle too big but nothing a little elbow grease and some creativity couldn't fix lol I am going to sew a pink bow on the hat to make it a little girlier and pair it with a skull and crossbones trick or treating bag which will be adorable! haha

Seems like a high quality costume so far so I think it is more worth $30 versus $55, just my opinion :-)"
I love the shoes.  My feet feels great even when I stand all day.  Great price and shipped quickly.  I have several Saucony shoes because they are high quality and normally do not need to be broken in.
Love these leggings. They came in one size but they fit me well. I normally wear small size. Nice color combinations too.
"This is my second Soybu Goddess. My purple one (a small) was just a bit too tight around my chest (36C). The medium is just right. The length on these is excellent. The fabric moves with you and doesn't ride up at all. It's a sturdy but breathable fabric. I removed the optional pads and just opted for the shelf bra which provides plenty of support for me. If they weren't so pricey, this is all I'd practice in!"
"I bought two pairs of these a couple of years ago at Ross, and they still are in great shape.  I'm just buying another pair here at Amazon.  Nice exercise pants."
bought this for a friend who is a size 10/12 on the bottom and a 36B cup and the large firs great. Someone with bigger boobs could fit the large also.
This organizer is just what I needed for my large bags. No more dumping out the contents of my large bags to find what I need.
Cute! I bought this for my daughter and it has held up well. The legs are short on her so it was a nice fall outfit.
"This is my third pair of shoe trees.  Mine are all wooden, but the rear heel grab-notch on this pair, is a nice touch.
Always love the smell of aromatic cedar in my closet.

A good deal and quality product."
every gorgeous.
I purchased a medium and it fit perfect. Dress was very flattering and I received lots of compliments
Gave it to my friend and his wife for a present. They loved it
This jewelry box is larger than I anticipated and fits a lot of items.  The tiffany blue color is beautiful and I love that it locks!  It looks stunning and has plenty of compartments.
Fit is just right and the shoes are very comfortable.
"These are the best sport bras ever purchased and worn, are so comfortable but yet supportive. I am doing circuit training and also run 6 miles when I have time, and with these bras I don't have to use another bra for additional support. Im in between a large and a medium in regular clothes but i decided to order a medium and am happy I did, the fit was perfect. Will be ordering more. The size chart for this bra is accurate. In love with this sport bra."
"Yes it was a little tight when I first got it but it stretched out after a couple of weeks. Super warm, soft and a good amount of colors to choice from."
"They a little small, but not bad also they narrow. So make sure your socks aren't too thick . Will edit review after travel to Canada ."
"Wife lived in them for 2 yrs, held up amazingly."
"It's a gorgeous product. Nice authentic detail. I'm going to keep it although it's a little small, because I know it's worth having. It's a great deal and I will fit it better soon I'm sure."
Very comfortable shoes. Definitely wear some boot socks with them though because with the loose top they tend to rub if your socks aren't high enough.
"These are my favorite and it's all I wear to work out. The best part, besides support, is that it doesn't give you a uniboob."
i used them for tutus and works great. They are not wide. But good for a toddler tutus. Great color assortment.
"I was very pleased with this bag's quality for the price it was and it is very cute for everyday use you could fit a small wallet, car keys and a few other things perfectly!"
"Cute and the arch support is great. The heel is not too high, the way I prefer them. You can dress them up or down."
"Fits good. Wish it were fitted but it works great for bulky winter clothes under it.
Very warm!"
"These shoes are great to look at and my grandson loves walking in them.  I love the fact that I am able to turn off the lights when he's too distracted looking down to even walk...LOL!

They are a little chunky, but still a great pair of shoes."
Very petite and great quality. Love the fact that it's light as well as durable. Stone has some gold veins and is a vibrant purple.
Very quick delivery.  I hope to return and shop some more! Thanks
Great support and protection
"I was looking for good back to school shoes deals on the net, and I found those for my kids. The Sketchers shoes arrived on time. Quality shoes, beautifully designed and they were a perfect fit."
Fit was great.  I like the zipper over the hook n eye closures.  Legs are a little longer than I expected (to the knees) and the straps are wide set so the adjusting clip is a little irritating where it falls on me.  But still a great buy!
Its beautiful skirt but are small as compared to normal sizes... i really wish they had elastic on the waists.
I like the colors  You Can put 1 to 5 things.
"Exactly what I needed for barre exercise class. They grip just enough to do the moves comfortably, without sticking to the floor."
"Love the skirt.  The only drawback is that you need to wear a slip underneath, which I do, because it is see-through.  Otherwise, I like it.  I have had it a while now and it hasn't faded and it stays true to its shape after washing. I would recommend this skirt."
Very cute his and hers ring holder. I gave it to my married kids for Easter. It is small but quaint.
Fabulous quality and fit. I am buying more. Highly recommend
"It is warm as expectbut  a little short .
Buy a bigger size maybe  a bit loose"
"Great for backup wedding band. My hands swell and regular rings don't fit. So comfortable. No allergy to surgical steel, keeps it's color and shine after months of everyday wear, cleaning, dishes, showers..."
Cute shoe looked long and hard for a pair of dressier flat sandals that I like. These are great.
Really phone very this belt. Good quality and you definitely can't beat the price.
"So cute and its great quality.  We are often out jumping in puddles and playing in the rain and this had lasted for 2 years so far.  I just rolled the sleeves if it was big on her at first, and it still looks great! Bought matching rain boots too and I love them!"
"This just arrived for my wife today. She has very sensitive skin and this is super soft. She wore it around the house today ""just because"". So it fulfills both the cute and the comfortable."
"Wonderful product that my husband enjoys wearing!
We may have to order another!
FAST shipping and arrived as described!
Thank you!
Thank you!"
"These earrings are great! Elegant and airy, they go with everything.  Good quality."
Very cute and good quality headband. Its hard to find black headbands that are nice
"these are the best casual sandal for going to the pool or beach, or just around the house. The plastic/rubber material they are made from seems more flexible, forgiving and tacky than most others.  The tacky quality makes them excellent wearing around water, they do not feel nearly as slippery as other shoes. They are simply the best."
"OMG. I love this dress. I ordered it in white and loved it so much that I got it in brown as well. It fits like a glove and it classy while still being sexy. I am 5'2, 140 pounds and the medium fits perfect. My measurements are 36, 29, 38. I would highly recommend this dress. You can wear it with sandals or heels to dress it up or down."
"He loves these boots. They are inexpensive, sturdy, he says they're comfortable, and they look cool on him.  They look good for work or casual."
I received it just in time to re-size my new watch.
Thank you for a beautiful assortment of colorful charms for my children's crocs!  They really like them and so do I!
these are the most comfortable shoes ever!!!  love these
"A real necessity when displaying jewelry at craft shows, It is also useful to keep your jewelry organized at home.  Also useful in other areas of the house, to corral dangling objects, especially the workshop."
Great fit and very comfortable. Silky fabric. Wearing well.
Thanks to learning how it fits per the web site it fit perfect.
lovely costume speedy delivery
"what more can i say?  i thought the toe seam would drive me mad since it seemed extra large and thick but once i washed them, the seam didn't seem to be an issue."
"Cute and fun,"
"Searched all over locally and online for a good pair of endless circle gold earrings for my father for Christmas.  This is the only style he will wear and his old one had been lost a year or so ago.  These earrings were just as described, arrived on time, and were a big hit when he opened his gift."
"Nice apron. A little big on me (I am 5'7"", 55 kg - pretty small), but it works!"
Nice color. I ordered a size up. Probably could have gotten true size.nice soft material
"Purchased a small rather than an extra small and the fit is fine. This tee was purchased for a slender woman as a weekend gad-about and be comfy. The extra small for her, 5'6"" slender would have worked. Soft, good print quality, well received as a gift."
"I love the shoes, they feel like comfy socks with a sole."
"Got the long sleeve 3xT and the sleeves were long enough, well made, sizing perfect!  Will definitely buy again."
"Most of my complaints center around the fact that these sunglasses are not like my old favorite pair I lost last year.  On the plus side, they're quite comfortable once you get them located in the sweet spot on your nose.  I wore these six hours straight on a road trip, and actually forgot they were on.  The frames are sturdy, with quality hinges.  The appearance is cool, if you like that sort of thing.  I mostly got them for something different.

There is some vision distortion, again depending on how high or low they sit on the nose.  They do not fold flat enough to fit in a pocket, so I attached a neck cord (not included).  The complaint about fitting ""somewhat small"" is not so much the size of the frame, but the size of the lenses and nose pads.

The included case is semi-hard, but adequate quality and fit.  All the advertised accessories were included, again of adequate quality.  25 beans is a pretty good price for glasses of this quality, but I would not call it a steal.  These are not my favorite sunglasses, but I like them well enough to buy a second pair, with the retro blue lenses.  Like those even better."
Loved it but had to return. To much side cleavage for me.
"This color is really pretty! It's very cheerful. I am 5'4"" bust measurement 41"" and the L fits great . This style skims off the body, and has some length, which is great because I've gained a few lbs I wish to cover. For the price, and AmazonPrime, can't be beat."
Not really a chef but I like to put on like I  now and then. Makes an amateur appear like an expert.  A can of soup is special when presented in one of these outfits. I find the quality v cost ratio very good.
"After years of searching for soft comfortable leather shoes I finally found them. Kenneth Cole Saturn shoes are the best ones on the market. The leather is soft, the inside is padded I feel like I walk on clouds when I wear them. I wish I found this shoe years ago"
so beatiful and a good price
"Large but that is what I wanted, feels nice and thick like a big fat towel....love it"
This was a gift and the recipient loves it. Great quality/Sturdy/Perfect
Love that it has memory foam on the inside
Great shoes. Good buy. I love Keen shoes. Especially love the color of these
Love them. . Highly recommend
Excellent shipping time.  Great fit.
"I am a size 16 long with big hips and a small waist.  I have always liked the way bootcut jeans (515s) make me look, but the standard dropped waist is uncomfortable and constantly gaps at the back, even when I wear a belt.  These jeans fix that problem completely!  The waistline curves up so that it is at my natural waist in the back, but still looks a little dropped in the front.  They fit perfectly too!"
Exitoso
These fit big for sure but in their defense my daughter has munchkin feet. Her feet measure about 3.5 inches and I bought the 6-12 month size. That being said the shoes are absolutely adorable so I can't wait until she fits into them! Love them
"A cute little shoe with a three inch heel..... That you can run and jump in. Lol , I literately did just that when I opened them up for the first time ! I couldn't believe how stable I felt in this high of a heel. Just a note they are a bit narrow, Not abnormally so but if you have wide feet you may run into issues. for me they are perfect."
I haven't tried to wear these shoes more than an hour. I bought them for when I wear my suits.
Very nice but had to return for a larger size.
"Love it, blends well with certain shirts I wear. and the design is great metaphysical  design."
"Very nice looking and light as expected.
However, it scraches very easy."
too cute  - perfect gift
"Very pretty pearls and a great value.  These are significantly larger than a second set I considered for the same price.  I plan to order several more sets to give to my bridesmaids.  Worth noting, these don't arrive in a gift box."
Fits my size 18 with plenty of stretchy room. It's really lovely looking as well.
Adorable purse for my 5 year old. Customer service is excellent. They followed up to make sure we are happy with our purchase. Companies do not do that anymore. A must buy!
Came as described. Worked great as a stacking ring. Fit properly for size ordered. Attached pictures show ring with two others.
"Gildan is my go-to company for tees. This long sleeve t-shirt is exactly what I wanted. It fits perfectly, washes well, and is very comfortable. The sizing is accurate. You won't be disappointed."
"The watch came in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  I am a tall, ""normal to a bit heavy"" 60 year-old woman.  The wrist band, although a bit stiff right now, fits my wrist nicely, with enough holes for adjustment.  The dial face size fits well with my body type and the numbers are easy to read.  I've been looking for a simple stylish watch like this for quite awhile, and I have now found it.  Thank you Timex!"
"I like my wife in less, too!  :-)"
"I couldn't believe the price of these! I was expecting cheaply made maybe last through one trip luggage, I've never been so happy to be wrong!! These are thick and durable and the sizes are just perfect!!"
I use Oglivie hair perm all of the time.  It's a great product for fine hair.
"Love it, an excellent choice for a gift to a girl. Nice quality and lovely desing. Swarovski is always the best choice. Highly recommend."
I love them they were more comfortable than I thought they would be  I love them I plan to order another pair different color
"This was so worth the money. I bought it for my 18-yr.-old college student as a nice starter watch, and it looks even better in person than it did on Amazon."
Gorgeous gift for my daughter and her Pandora bracelet.  Very pleased!
"Great watch, works perfectly as it should!"
"Note this is not a sweater but a shirt. For the price, I think it was a great buy, and the size was correct. I got a small and I am 5' 4"" and 125 lbs."
"This is a really cute sweater, however the zip opening is too small, and hurts my son when we put it on and take it off (he's only at 40-50% for head circumference)."
"Hi I love my shirt. However I have received a knock off shirt before. If it is a kerusso shirt it should have the tag pictured here. I included front and back.

A genuine shirt should have a good quality material. Mine is 100% cotton. And the label is clear not fuzzy like it was printed cheaply.

Another tip is to find a handful of reputable companies on here and frequent them.

Have now worn for a while and has held up very well and has had several compliments from people that have liked it."
this is my third pair and I love them. They are very comfortable and wears comfortably with socks.
"I don't normally buy shoes, clothing, etc. without trying them on in a store first, but I matched these in size to a couple pair I already have; plus, it's been hard to find a perfect fit, even at a store.  I've worn Deer Stag in the past, and found them comfortable & long-lasting.  These shoes arrived a couple days late, due to mail holiday closure, but are very nice quality, --and I have a shoe stretcher.  It would have been better to order the in-between size, 11-1/2 EEE, but not offered.  Thank you, The shoes  also look very nice."
"Purchased this belt for my son, loves it, the leather is soft yet sturdy, love all the holes and goes with everything. Very well made!"
"I looked everywhere and then came to Amazon and there it was, my red visor! It fits great, looks great, and I think I may come back for more colors!"
Super comfy and versatile shoes - these are the best cross-trainers I own!
"This was bought for a tall thin ten year old who has a torso too long for a 14, but has a birth mark on her tummy that she's become shy about -- no two-piece for her right now.  The suit is a little loose but the cut of the back and straps is perfect for her.  She also loves the color.  I would definitely buy a Speedo next time."
"Nice Sandals. They fit me well, an issue because I have swollen feet. A size 11 is my normal size, and it works with these sandals. they seem good quality, and are comfortable enough for me to run to the street and pick up my mail. I will typically be wearing them for short periods."
Read all the reviews so I down size one size and it fit perfectly. Very cute top. Would recommend this to a friend
Great quality and they fit great!
Fun tote! Quality is just okay.
"Works great! Used it on a European trip.  I was able to hold 300 and 2 credit cards in it. I would not recommend carrying that much all the time in it because I would have to take it all out to get the amount that I needed out. The only bad thing about this pouch was that when it got I got hot or humid it would itch. Not really bad, just enough to annoy me. Pouch very discrete,  and I didn't feel weird pulling money out of my shoulder as opposed to my cleavage!"
This product does not disappoint except it smelled. It came quickly and the person we gave it to loves it. Great deal for us!
This thing is so quiet you might think it's not working!  I got this for my husband so he could dry his work boots in the winter time.  We average around 10-20 degrees in the winter and used this thing in the cold garage.  Boots dried quickly despite the low temps. Great value for the price.
"This is a great, solid ring with surprising weight to it.  My mother and I actually argued over who got to keep the ring.  It's a very good quality."
"Just had to write a review for those of you that are unsure what size to buy. I'm 5 ft 3, weight 126, I'm curvy, waist 28, hips 37 bust chest 34, my torso is 10 inches. I bought the Small and I can only fit the first row of snaps, and it's pretty stretchy but takes a few minutes to get it on. It does make you sweat and it's great for your posture, however, a very tight fit. The trainer does push up all of your back fat, and it's not flattering, but it' does the job. I wear the trainer while I workout for up to 2 hours and I've already loss a few inches off my waist and back.

After using this product for over a year, it's still in good condition. My only  complaint is that I wish it had more boning in the tummy area."
Finally a shoe that DD will wear on a daily basis!  Love them!  I am so sad that I can't find them anymore.
"I've been wearing these for months through the fridged cold of Northern Canada, to swampy ass areas in the midwest. These boots keep my feet warm and after time of wearing them they tend to mold to your foot. Big fan, Highly recommend"
"The Velcro is super strong, great quality.  There is a lot of length and Velcro so this would fit both petite and large women very easily, very customizable fit.  This works great and I am very happy with my purchase. The Velcro is super loud though when removing it in the morning and baby is asleep - LOL. So just make sure you are far from your sleeping baby when taking it off. "
Great product. I've been using them all winter with virtually no fray-ing.
I will wear it.
Ordered this for my wedding day. It had great support and made me feel 100% secure in a strapless dress.  This is the first strapless bra I have liked.
I love this watch.  I can wear it in the shower without any problems.  The only thing that drives me nuts about the product is sometimes it changes to military time and I have to switch it back.
"I'm pleasantly surprised.  Each strap is adjustable via velcro and provide a perfect strap fit. The footbed is soft and the material is grippy enough to keep the sandal from slipping off.  It would be even better if the footbed was microfiber.  Still, I liked this sandal so much I bought it in another color as well."
wore these throughout my pregnancy and they are so comfortable.
"I wanted to keep this so bad!  It really is a beautiful set.  Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong size, so I had to send back.  I really loved the look and feel of it and I plan on ordering the right size.  It's just to good to let go.  If you are looking for an awesome steampunk piece this is one will make a great addition or even your star piece.  It's a great feature that will work with s full look or even jeans.  Just pay attention to size chart and order the size that coincides with your measurements."
"Cute but sizes run small. Also, the cat was already starting to peel off a little bit."
These just became my new daily underwear. After a couple of days with these I ordered more. They're very comfy and the price isn't ridiculous like other quality clothes.
I'm a 2x and this fits more like a 3x
Perfect with Tinker bell Dress.
"I LOVE this dress. It feels amazing and fits great. I am 5'3"" and it is long on me but if I were to wear heels it will be fine.  the fabric is thick do you will not need to worry about your underwear showing though. I bought the navy blue and it is a rich color. As a plus my man says he loves it as well."
The product is well made. I like them but will order the next size up the next time.
They are thin but give the foot a bit of support needed during their first steps. Easy to put on and adjustable which is great. The sole is not all rubber but I find it good for a baby who is only learning how  to walk
"My wife and daughter both love this and I have to say that I definitely see a difference in their hair. They both have long, naturally wavy hair but it usually tangles....at least they used to. Not any more. It also smells great, very clean and fresh. They also both blow their hair dry and I think this helps a lot to keep their hair healthier. Their hair looks healthier and feels smoother. They also said they don't use much, so a little goes a long way."
My son loved.
"Size ran perfect for me. I ordered the size I generally wear for shoes and they fit. As an added, not mentioned in the description bonus, I received confidence in my pathetic bowling skills. These shoes had me bowling the best games of my life. I bowled a 100 almost every game and I didn't even use bumpers!
All kidding aside, the shoes fit well. They were affordable, which is what I was looking for. I am not a regular bowler. I just wanted something I could use when taking my kids for the ""kids bowl free"" (but shoes are not included and you end up spending more on shoe rental for a game of bowling you had no intention of doing until you got an offer for a ""free"" game) summer program. I appreciated the offer from the local bowling alley, and having my own shoes helped make the program afffordable for our family. They also look better than those silly shoes they rent at the alley."
"Had never heard of this brand until I saw it on Amazon and needed these in a hurry. What a pleasant surprise both product and cost-wise. These fit perfectly (5'3"" 120 lbs) and they are the perfect control top, no visible seams and they go down your leg to the perfect spot. I thought this looked a tad gray even though they were supposedly black, but that may have been the lighting or that I was wearing black on black. Highly recommend; I work in a professional environment and feel like a  professional hosiery shopper and I'm so glad to have found something like this in this price range. Seriously the best I've ever had so far."
"Just a little too big, but overall great shoe."
Haven't actually worn them out yet because it's too hot in Texas. Will edit to update about wear and comfort once I wear them outside of the house.
Great quality! Even better deal.
Thanks a lot!  beautiful!
"It's my second purchase. I like this strap so much. It's light, comfortable, dries fast if it gets wet, and stretches a little so it doesn't feel so tight around your wrist. If I were to be really picky, I wish if they had a choice of gold or silver buckle (silver is standard - for gold, you have to purchase gold buckle separately), but I really don't care that much about the buckle. Will definitely buy again."
"beautiful.and loving it, very spacious."
Great jacket but runs a little large. I am usually am XS ( 5'4 and 105pounds) but got this in an XXS from previous reviews and it fits perfect. Great for layering and very lightweight and packable in the bag provided.
I love these I order all the time the really cool colors every yr.
"What happens when its getting cold out and you need some shoes for a vacation? You turn to Amazon and stumble across these Gold Pigeon Shoes Sandals! With something that can survive water, keep your feet cool, and being yellow (My son's current favorite color) being the prerequisites.

The shoes are not only durable but the magnetic locks keep them on place rather sturdily which I was almost concerned about. The material is designed to keep them from slipping and they look great to boot.

These are a great pair of sandals and I can't stress how much I love them on my son.

Disclaimer: I did receive a pair of these in exchange for an honest review"
Badass shemagh in gray...to match all your other gray tactical operator crap
"Great shirt for a Starwars fan! I guess I just wasn't thinking ""juniors"" sizing when I ordered it."
Love this. Kept me warm and snug.
"I was looking for something so that my necklaces won't tangle and that I had a place to put them all. This jewelry tree is so pretty on my dresser. When I was looking for this type of product I wanted something that could hold rings and earrings as well and it was unique. This jewelry tree was perfect. Very sturdy, even stands up to my cats trying to knock it down."
Nice shirt.  We'll see how it holds up and resists fading when washed.  So far so good.
Comfortable fit especially in a size large enough or my son.
Cute and comfortable. What more could you want? Got lots of compliments on it when I wore it.
I found a pair at another store but they are comfortable and they look really good. I had gotten them in a lighter tan. They are tightfitting a little bit and are meant to be worn without socks or maybe thin socks.
I usually wear a 10 but bought 11 just in case well they fit exactly!!! No room and I have to wear with the thinest socks I xan find. Overall they are light in terms of weight the colors are fantastic they are not unfomfortable they fit narrow so if u have wide feet u may have a prob. I will buy again thoough. They are nice.
"bought for my wedding. the quality is fantastic, heel is comfortable, style is very funky/vintage. I wear them now with dresses and jeans."
I like these moccasins feels like you are bear foot but you aren't. I whear them out side to walk my dog on paithment and gravile roads they where great. Lots of fun! Great price seem to take a beetling.
Very happy with these. Fit is true to size
"i bought it for NO GI JJ and it's worked out well, good fit and cool in class."
"Well made, very comfortable sandal and wide, which I needed.  Runs a bit large so I would think of going down by a half size. Great customer service from seller."
These are perfect soft and stretchy. I am a size 18 womans and got the 3xl fits perfect. Super fast shipping nice quality!
"I had a long truck key copied (no chip). I drilled another hole in the copy and trimmed down the extra metal.  Works great, I could have picked up the longer version, but this is way cooler (and smaller)"
"A little small, but I wear them to work in my pink scrubs. Since I wear scrubs everyday, I like to add a little bling!"
Luxury...!!! Very nice.
"My daughter was baptized at 4 months, she was 11 lbs and 24.5 inches.  I followed the sizing chart, ordered the 6-month size as the chart suggested, and it was perfect!!

The hem did start to unravel but I think it had been caught on my ring or her nail... but not a big deal. She looked very sweet on her big day."
"This arrived yesterday.  It arrived very quickly and was well packaged.  It came in a cute, little, red gift box with a cleaning cloth, it was then packaged inside of a mail bag.  The anklet is very pretty and dainty looking.  It is very shiny and attractive.  Although it looks very dainty it is well made and not to delicate that it will break from wearing.  I wore it to work today and received many compliments on it.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

7/5/2016 review update:
I really loved this anklet but after wearing it daily since I got it I need to update my review.  Everything I stated above still stands however the clasp on the anklet comes undone, often.  Several time it has come off, luckily I was always at home and was able to find it and put it back on.  Unfortunately it happened again today while I was out shopping, I felt it fall off my ankle as I was walking out to my car, I stopped immediately to look for it, my son was with me and looking as well but we could not find it.  So because of a faulty clasp I no longer have my favorite anklet.  I am not sure if I just got a bad clasp or if this is a problem that others have experienced as well.  Very disappointed."
Son absolutely loves this wallet and it is a much better quality than you would expect from a similar type commercialized product.
Great looking boots. Just waiting on boot season now!!!
"My granddaughter's nickname is Cat, so when I saw these shoes, she just had to have them. They fit great, are very flexible. Just starting to walk, she had an excellent sole platform that gripped and would bend with ease as she stepped out. And last,but not least, they are simply adorable!"
Husband loves these. Very soft.
Good sandals so far...It's been 1 week.
Quality product. Not the first time I've bought them. They always fit and look the same. Consistency has value.
"You know how they say you don't recognize a bad relationship until you get into a good one?  That was my relationship with my previous underwire sports bra.  It hurt, the wire came loose and poked, but I assumed those were the things you put up with to have an underwire sports bra.  Then I put on one of these! (Sound of heavenly choir).  Now, I haven't put it through an intense aerobics class yet, but I've worn them to work for weeks and have run short distances, jumped, crawled, and twisted in it, and it has performed well and I have not been embarassed.  I wear a sports bra to work because I sometimes have to unexpectedly engage in such physicality, and these are a great improvement over my previous bras.  I wear a 42D, and keeping me looking dignified is no small task.  The ability to convert it to racerback is a bonus (a little hook can hold the two straps together in the back), though I usually wear it in the traditional way.  One fitting tip: when I wore the band too tight, my breasts got distorted into an almond or teardrop shape--as soon as I got the band right, they looked like breasts again."
as expected my wife loved it
Cute costume! Just fit well!
"I definitely have to size up in Jambu shoes, but the last is perfect for me and this is my second pair. I'm on my feet a lot, standing or walking, and definitely recommend them!"
Just what every wallet needs.  Great.
"ok Okey this product is exelent, the shoes is fine, beautiful and economic, good choice,my daughter is very happy whit tis product"
So delicate and beautiful!  This will be a perfect gift for my daughter.
"Cool and comfortable, has crocs comfortable insole, size is perfect, would recommend buying this shoe love all the different colors, in fact ordered another one in new color."
"I purchased the turqoise knee length Bohemian peasant skirt and just love it. So comfy and cute. Must be cautious about washing due to many threads connecting the sequins so I just gently swish in a bucket of water or the bathtub with gentle detergent and hang to dry. I also purchased the long green version of the same skirt which was a bit too long for me (I am 5'4""). These are really fun, comfortable, and cool for hot summer days. BombayFashions did a great job of getting it delivered when promised and also they didn't overpackage the product."
Good Weejuns...Expect them to stretch a little once you wear them for a while
These shoes are the most comfortable shoes my husband owns. He loves them. And wears them all the time. I am buying him more in different colors.
I love them. They are very comfortable. I have 4 pairs and they are the best wearing shoes.  They are very light. I usually wear Nike but now that I got these they mostly stay in the closet.
"This sweater is exactly as amazing as it looks. Obviously the monkey area doesn't breathe, but the rest of it does, and the material is softer than expected."
"Fits well, provides good protection, and deep pockets are perfect for helping to carry items."
"I got the X-Large, which was a bit large for me, but it looks good. I'm hoping it will shrink in the dryer."
"fast s/h, everything I anticipated at a really good price. great communication."
"Very pretty and sparkly in the light. Definitely believable. My normal size was too snug. Returning and ordering one size bigger. Can't wait to wear it!

Update- got the right size and wear all the time now. This rings is so much prettier in person than the pictures even show. I get compliments 4 out of 5 times I wear it! I added some pictures because other buyers' pictures were so helpful to me when I was deciding to buy it. I hope they help! Love love love this ring. I seriously can't find one thing negative to say about it. Definitely buy it :D

October update- I've had this ring for almost 6 months now. I wear it all the time and it is still as pretty and sparkly as ever! I clean it only with a soft toothebrush and dish shoap and it's still perfect."
"My husband wears a size 14 sneaker, and we always have trouble finding something comfortable that will wear well in his size.  He found Sketchers a few years ago (recommended by our physical therapist), and he swears by these sneakers!  We were delighted to see them on Amazon in his size.  The other colors were sold out before we had a chance to order them!"
"work good,,love the way shoe fits after install,  I do not recommend if you do a lot of squatting, do to the pins pulling out..  a touch of super glue will solve the problem however.  It is nice to just slip into your shoes"
Very good costume mask. Looks and feels pretty good. Could not have asked for a better Friday 13th costume mask.
I love these. My 3rd pair. Last pair lasted over 3 years and I wear them almost constantly through the spring and summer.
"I'm in love with these pants! So comfortable and the fit is fantastic! I'm 5'5 145 Curvy athletic built. I carry weight in my hips, rear, and thighs. These pants are perfect. I got a size 8 regular which is the size pants I wear in everything and they are roomy. If these were everyday pants, I'd get a size 6 but for hiking and canyoneering, these are perfect. Can't recommend them enough!

The drawstring at the waist assures that they won't fall off. I wore these on a 13 hour canyoneering trip in Zion Canyon. They dried quickly and made it so I could move comfortably. I also wear them as everyday pants because they look so good and are comfortable."
It is INCREADIBLE!!!!!!!!
"A little big but I ordered a size up! Wore it a few times! Like it comes high above the knees! I am 5'7.5"" tall 132 lbs"
Cool Shirt!
"I get compliments from Airline workers all the time. One thing for sure, these aren't coming off. I travel 60% of the month. One of the 2 I have has been dented and bent from travel but the thing is indestructible. This is by far the best luggage tag in the market."
Beautiful looks really classy!!
"My 6 year old daughter just loves it. I wasn't expecting much but it's actually quite beautiful, there's a lacy ""cape"" that surrounds the whole dress- I have no idea how to describe that any better, Tim Gunn I'm not. Anyway, the licensed Frozen dresses are absurdly priced, this isn't exactly cheap but a good value so far, if it doesn't hold up I'll change my review."
Me and my 9yr old daughter both love it.
"Too small, purchased for a gift."
i sure do like it . its mine and thank u very much
"I have bought many pairs of TOMS in the past, knowing that when I purchase them they will be a bit snug.  However, the last few pairs that I have bought have been a lot looser.  This led to sliding on my feet and blisters.  I will order a smaller size next time, perhaps they changed how they fit."
Cute and perfect size for my 3 yr old granddaughter!  I bought 2 of these because she wears ponytails and looks so adorable! The quality is great and my daughter likes that the clips keep them in place!
He loved it and it came in the mail very fast!
"The fit is great. The softness of the fabric is appealing, as is the breathability. I didn't get the colors in the photo, which is great because the yellow-green is awful. =) Mine were purple, dark blue, light blue, and pink."
my daughter will love them - this is a gift
"Lovely shoe!!  It is lightweight, comfortable and beautiful!!  The platform provides good arch support.  I have small feet and they fit perfectly."
"Call it 4.5 stars. They look great, but the highly-polished leather is susceptible to forming creases once they're flexed for a day or two.
Nice color, fit very well."
"Just what I was looking for! It is sheer, but it sleeps well and washes well. I hang it to dry."
"Super comfy and very pretty.  The only draw backs are the dye runs horribly.  HORRIBLY.  So make sure you hand wash it alone.  The only draw back is some of the stitching has popped loose from the shoulder strap, easy to fix with a few stitches and needle/thread.

I'd purchase again without second thought"
"Great shirt, got a compliment at the movie theater.  Fits nice with vivid color."
"This cardigan is very nice, for a reasonable price"
"A Really nice pair of socks. It is very hard to find Larger size socks that feel good.  These feel great.  but with buying 12 pair, i have already worn holes through about 3 pair. But I guess that after a year, wearing near exclusively these socks, I don't think that would be too bad.  About to buy more."
"I love these pj's. For my son but make sure you size up. For my 9-10 month thats 23 lbs I ordered size 2. The quality of these pjs is wonderful, I cannot recommend enough. The customer service for this company is beyond perfect."
got this dress as a gift the person that I purchased it for love the color love to fit
"I've carried this backpack on a couple trips, and I'm really happy with it. Its a great size for carrying on the plane so you can avoid a checked bag. The longest trip I've packed for with this backpack is 2 weeks. It has developed a small tear that I plan to fix."
Really happy with this product.  I love the size and it fits well in my purse.
This is my third pair. Really like.
"I use this as a base-layer at work. I like the material, nice and soft, but keeps me warm when needed. It fits me well in the shoulders and mid section, and arms. Easy to pull the sleeves up when I'm indoors. I also like that it is easy to fold, fabric doesn't stick to itself."
"Great fit, color and is wearing well."
Well crafted durable piece.
"Wife loves it.  Cheaper than fixing her Bulova, which broke after 3 years.  Good thing I got the Bulova as a work gift rather than buying it."
This dress looks nice and is made from a good material. It fits a tad too tight for my liking. I am 5'11 and 180lbs I normally wear a large and that's what I ordered.
"Bought it on a whim reading the reviews. No regrets! Im glad i bought it,(in beige color)will buy more in different colors! Very nice quality,looks elegant! Cant beat the price!
Buy it with confidence!"
"They're very cute shoes, only thing is they should come in half sizes."
They are gorgeus and They are made with a good quality material. Look great and They are really cheap but do Not look cheap at all.
"Very pretty these exactly as the picture shown online, the quality is very good and my doughter loves them so much she want to where them everywhere I really recomand these"
"My son has extra thick and wide feet. These are great! I feel like the run a bit on the small side, but maybe 1/2 a size, if that."
"I have a somewhat wide foot.  I can sometimes buy regular widths, but I often need a wider width in a heel.  These are very comfy and although I haven't worn them all day, I think I would be able to with no problem.  The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is that I wish they were a little ""cuter"".  They serve the purpose for a traditional looking pump for someone who needs a wider width."
Love my Bra30. I will order more.
"Fits great, love them. Just wash, no ironing"
Best postpartum top ever. Wore in hospital instead of robe. Worked great for breastfeeding and skin to skin. Wish I had know about this with previous kids. Also great for hiding tumy while waiting for baby weight to come off. I have bought several in short and long sleve!
"Great Girls Hiking Shoe! Our 7 year old was always blowing out the soles or toes of her shoes from playing so hard. We needed to find a pair of shoes that would be comfortable enough for all day wear, but also be extra durable. These shoes are just that. She can wear them for walking, running, playing, going to school, fishing, playing sports, and of course hiking. The color is a nice deep purple, but not too bright. The outer material is a mixture of suede and leather. The material seems to hold up well and doesn't scuff easily. This is just an all around great shoe and we expect them to last her easily until she grows out of them."
Great fit. Strong chemical smell that takes several washing a to remove.
"These are way too big for my 8.5 feet, but hey, they are pretty freaking adorable so I wear them all the time. Makes my morning a little more magical ;)"
"So, this shirt is super soft. Everyone compliments me on it, and my kids just nuzzle their faces on me for the fuzz. I have no idea what it's made of. It has no laundering instructions. I washed it on delicate with cold water and laid it flat to dry. Now for the sizing.. this thing has a supreme amount of stretch. When I put this on the sleeves came about 2 inches above my wrist, which is way to short for my taste. But if I pull on them they go past my fingertips. Same with the torso, it comes past the top of my low rise jeans, but I could probably stretch this sucker down to a tunic dress. Sadly, until I figure out how to stretch the sleeves permanently I will have to keep pushing them up to 3/4 sleeves to make them look right. Hence the 1 star deduction. If I can get the sleeves to stretch down though, this will be a truly lovely sweater."
"I ordered them with 28 inseam expecting them to be a little long, but they were perfect even though I am probably a 27.5 inseam, The front broke perfectly on the show in front, after a few washes they should be even better. Finding pants with an inseam this short is a challenge.  SCORE!!!!!"
"These are very pretty earrings, I was surprised that the silver is thick making it less likely to bend like some other earrings might."
"I fit into a somewhat roomy size 41, classic fit jacket. Most vests I tried on were too small, so I decided to look online. The size LG Dockers says it starts at 42, and by that they mean a very roomy 42, as it was much too big for me. Slim fit size 42 jackets were too small, so this is not a slim fit.

Very nice material and look for the price though. I went ahead and ordered the medium."
"My favorite purse.  When I go shopping and running errands, I can just drop my mail and other items in easily."
"These are really pretty earrings, what a gorgeous blue.  I was extremely happy when I opened the box.  They look way more expensive than they are.  If you have long hair, consider wearing it up with these.  When the crystals catch the sunlight.. just beautiful."
Very good qualitu clothing and my daughter looks so cute in it. I will be purchasing more Calvin Klein clothes for my baby girl.  I don't really like the woman's line lmaoo but kid clothes are great
Really like the colors in this!  Made of good material.
Love them and they are great for running.  They have a lot of cushion and I would definitely recommend these to anyone who does a lot of running.
much easier than buying 4 new bras at $35.00 each--or more!!
"The boots are beautiful but run very small around the heel. I couldn't even get my heel into it. I'm beginning to wonder if they are even made by Frye?!  I own several pairs of Frye boots and none of them have had such an odd,uncomfortable fit. I will not be ordering this particular boot again. I see others have the same complaint I do. I have a normal width foot. It's not wide and it's not narrow.
The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because of the style of the boot is fabulous and the return policy was easy."
I bought this for my father who plows snow for the state and he loves this. It is bright and it is very warm.
my husband loved it..it fitted him perfectly
Love this. I receive compliments every time  I wear it. Good quality and you can't beat the price.
More expensive than Walmart but they never have my size.  Just plain jeans with plenty of room in the seat and thighs.  Very durable.
nice and thick to wear in the winter
"These are one of the best running shoes that I hace bought , very well cronstructed, very light weight & great quality materials, the only issue I found is that they tend to fit a little small, I usually get 10,5 D size on Asics or Saucony, but with this I ordered 1/2 size up and got an 11D size and perfect fit, as  others have advised on their reviews here!"
"I was very pleased with these $16.99 shoes. I guess you get what you pay for in this instance, because the other two pair of MAX stops were AWFUL! These are a different brand, and good quality"
"I bought this shoe because of the perforated leather. It is very comfortable to wear in summer. The toe box was a little too narrow. The heel cup was well fitted. I have very narrow heels, so this was a delight."
"Arms are a little long, but that's easily handled by simply rolling them up a couple of inches. Length of the body is what I care more about and this one is great. Liked it enough that I ordered a second one (different color).

Looks really good as a regular shirt."
I have not worn it as yet but it looks great and fit as it looks.
"Let me just say that Clarks are by far the best shoe for me. I have a total of 7 pair of shoe/boots/sandals. They are comfortable and well made. I was looking for a lace up boot to replace my 15 year old lace up boots. These boots are comfortable, well made and true to size. I am a 9 and these did not disappoint. They also came on time. I will continue to buy Clarks."
"arrived on time and fit as expected, Thank You"
"Good quality, kids have had for a month and they are very durable.  Sized to fit real money and ""credit cards""."
"I ordered a size larger as stated in prior reviews and I adore it, the silver button details are great and I have long torso and long arms and the fit is amazing, TY"
These are very nice for the price. Somewhat small and becomes slightly see-through from stretching but can function well with the right clothing.
"Finally!! Pants with a flat waistband! These size 12 fit me beautifully. I am 5'8"", 152lbs, 37"" at just below the belly button where the waistband hits me, 44"" at the hip (measured at the widest part of my bootie) and my thighs measure about 24.5"" around.  These pants don't gap at the back waistband like so many do. The legs fit loose enough to not show the lumps and bumps, but aren't baggy. The material is stretchy and looks slightly dressy and is lightweight, but not too thin."
these were my everyday till I got newer crocs with a strap. More secure for work.
"Excellent bra. Most comfortable bra I have ever purchased! I have a few different styles in this Bali brand, but this is my favorite favorite. So soft, so flattering, fit perfect, and no discomfort anywhere. Not many bras fit that bill, lol. I will be purchasing more very soon."
My husband is enjoying his Christmas present.
This one not only a great deal but such a comfortable bra ever! Love  it
"Fit well, priced well, happy with purchase."
Love these shoes I have several pair always happy when I purchase never disatisfied
Awesome shorts. Very nice quality for this cheap price. They fit really well and the material feels awesome on the skin.
The best pair of Wrangler jeans I've owned.
Absolutely love them. No problem with the orange stitching coming off. I actually like the colors a lot. Great shoes to wear all day.
Great costume ! Great price!
This is a great dress. It's very flattering. It's kind of short but I also have a long torso so for most people it would probably be fine. Looks amazing on me.
"I ordered a medium, I am 5'6 , 135 lbs, and a size 34 B. This dress is so cute, the length is good for my height, it hits above the knee. The color of this dress, online, just by looking at it looks to be a dark orange, rust kind of color, even though it states cantaloupe. I was expecting it to be a darker orange rust color, but to my surprise it was like a peach, or very light pink orange. It is so pretty though, even the back with the doily lace. However my one TINY issue is that where the armpits are, it looks stretched out, its such a minor issue but it does bug me. Altogether I would recommend this dress, I am def keeping it."
"means I look good with this,  my wife said"
"The item says Burn Out- the photos show skin and pants
clearly thru the fabric, yet the comments complain about
being sheer?? Learn to read before you order."
This is beautiful.... But due do down a size
I wore this for an 80s throwback Christmas party.  Really well made.  Makes me wonder why these still aren't popular again.  The women at work were jealous.
These rings (I got 5 different colors) were all beautiful and sparkly. The colors are true to what I see on my screen. They are absolutely beautiful. I love them!
"Nice and colorful. Toes kept getting caught on the seam so wearing thicker socks helped that. Otherwise comfy, grippy enough sole and wide :)"
These are my wedding shoes! They are everything I wanted! Great price compared to Nordstrom and Macy's!!!  They are also comfortable big plus!
Love these- got my husband a pair and that is all we wear all summer long!  They are so comfortable to wear!
"For my snowboarding trip, I bought this 'warmwear' garment. I absolutely love it. It fits snugly and goes nicely under anything else you wish to wear."
Bought these for my grand son who loves Thomas the tarin engine. Bought as an ensemble/theme for birthday with rain coat and umbrella. Great response for this.
I love Fitflop sandals but am having a hard time finding the right fit in Fitflop shoes. I normally wear a 7 or a 7 1/2 but the 7 in this style is too big and slips on my heel and the 6 1/2 is too short and my toe is cramped. If this style had more of a round toe the 6 1/2 would be fine for my wide foot. The Superloafer style with the rounder toe was my first choice but was not available in the 6 1/2 and the 7 was also too big. Thank you Amazon for free shipping and returns!
It got here faster than expected! I bought a handful EXO merchandise for my nieces birthday. Everything seems to be good quality for the price.
"I'm 5'2"" and am a die-hard Levi's fan.  It's about all I wear. Their skinny jeans and leggings, even in short (if you can find them), are always too long.  I wanted a form-fitting jean that I could wear with heels for a sleek, lean leg.  I'm 5'2"" and about 106 - I order size 5.  These hit just above the ankle and are perfect with heels.  I'm going to be careful about laundering them because I don't want shrinkage and for them to go too far above the ankle.  The only thing I didn't really like about them is that instead of there being a hem they're rolled a couple of times, very small, and sewn.  I suppose I could have this taken out and have a simple seam sown at the bottom (which I might still do).  I ordered these in white and liked them so much a I ordered another pair in regular blue denim.  I think they'll work really well with little ballet flats and Havaianas, too."
I got these shoes for my 1 year old son for our beach trip.  They fit him well enough.  They were just hard to get on his feet.
"Beautiful color, nice strong hardware and detailing. The bag has a little less structure that I thought it would, so I put a thin piece of cardboard in the center pocket, to keep it from being too floppy. Otherwise, I am very pleased with my purchase."
Birthday present and it was very well received.  EVERYONE should carry one of these to protect their identity.
"I use this for volleyball and it's a very practical shirt. It covers a lot, but still leaves room for easy movement. I might go a size up next time for an even more relaxed fit."
"After reading previous customer reviews, I decided to try these.  I need extra space in the toe box, and have wide feet.  Even though a wide size was not offered, the shoe was perfect - as recommended in prior reviews, I ordered my regular size.  It is quite wide, and smooth inside, without extra seams in the front section, which should lead to less irritating rubbing.  These are very comfortable; they are even better than I had expected.  The shoes are extremely light, and will be perfect to pack and take along on trips.  I have not had a chance to test them out in the water yet. There are no holes in the sole for drainage, so that is a concern.  Laces are extremely long.  The sunny lime color is fun."
These are the most comfortable pants I own. You can't even tell you have them on. Flattering to curvy women.
I would have liked a more substantial fabric.  I must have missed the fact they were not leather.
"Well made, lots of spandex for snug fit.  Good bra for gals with bigger bosoms, though not so sure on the ""minimizing"" factor.  But it's pretty and fun.  If you are in this larger size category consider this model of Lilyette.  I've had quite a few now and they hold up well, especially if you wash them by hand.  7-24-16: another review.  These are great bras, well designed, top rate fabric.  Just ordered 2 more.  I  think I've had about 7-8 of them.  Thing is, if you take care of them, and wash by hand, they last.  But, you have to have a few so you can trade them out, ( this is key!)  and give the others a rest.  The stats:  the underwire doesn't come up so far that it hits you in the chin, rather, it remains low, right between your boobs, and, the bra fits and sticks right on your bod, not poking or even trying to poke out, either under the arm or out front.  And you know what I mean girlfriends.....Also, the cup is flexible, yet solid in holding your boobs in place.  There is a little giggle, but not much.  And, it's comfortable.  Being 40DD I have to wear a bra, hate it, but that's that, but, this bra is almost like not having one on, at least for me, all bodies being so different.  One more thing, they have them in some pretty pattern designs which is delightful and sexy, not all that plain white stuff.  Btw, i no longer go to the store to getem, once you know your size and it fits, just order online.  Forget the terror of the dressing room and all that bad lighting!  Big Bosomed Women and Men Unite!"
Bought these for my 3 year old son and he loves them and doesn't even want to wear pants in the house.  I really like the patterns and think they are so cute on him.  I've already bought 3 packs and will surely buy more!
Love the Pumps!
very comfortable and will be purchasing more.  First pair I had to send back because they were a medium which was more like a 34-36 waist rather than a 32.
Nice all around waterproof shoe. Quality as expected. I own Merrell Hiking Shoes but the Fraxion is not for serious hiking. It's more for a walk in the woods shoe without worries of getting the shoe wet when stepping in a puddle or crossing a small brook.
As expected.  My daughter loves it soo much!
Solid $40 shoe. Only worn them 3 times so far for long shifts. Feel great so far.
Love this pants...
"thin layer, but cute"
Most comfortable shoe for me.
I have not worn a non-unerwire bra since my 20's.  I love It! It is very comfortable. I am a 44DD and was not confident it would give me any support. It does! It is also very soft.
"The product was sent for me to review.  It is a very beautiful piece of jewelry and any mom would love to receive this. There are two silver hearts, the bigger heart has crystals and rhinestones going around the edge and the smaller heart has ""MOM"" in it.  There is a nice quality clasp that is big and easy to use.  The chain is durable and you can adjust the length of the necklace a little.  It also comes with a black velvet bag for storage with is very pretty. I would definitely order other pieces of jewelry from this company and the quality is great and the prices are excellent."
"Very supple uppers.  Not really designed for good arch support, and should not be considered for walking.  The soles are designed not to pick up debris, so good for the boater who doesn't want their fiberglass surfaces scratched.  Sailors may find that with the steep angles of heel, that these shoes are a bit too supple and don't give the confidence to move about the boat.  Perfect for the big power cruiser owner to walk their poodle about the decks, and look classy doing it."
"This is a lovely jewelry stand. It has lots of space, and I'm able to ft all of my jewelry onto it. The top attached to the baseplate by inserting the thin metal vertical bar into a hole in the baseplate, and then tightening a small screw. It's fairly sturdy, however, my cat knocked it over and while it did not break, the two pieces became separated, so I do wish the method of securing the top and bottom was a little more secure. I feel that that's it's only flaw though. Would recommend."
"Being only 4'11"" tall presents a multitude of problems, the main one being pants that are way too long, even in Petite sizes. If I can manage to find Petite/Short, I'm thrilled! Ruby Rd. usually offers Pants in the shorter length, but I didn't pay attention when ordering these, so the length is about 1-2 inches too long & I will just have them shortened. Ruby Rd. products are excellent quality & I've always been able to wash & wear everything they make. Highly recommend!"
We were so delighted with the many colors and the quality is just superb.  This is a great gift for your sweet little one.  We will wear for her baptism!
Wearing them right now in fact. Very soft and can't beat the affordability. I think the pattern looks even better in real life if that's even possible.
Absolutely stunning! This dress was my second choice because the dress I wanted was sold out and I was a tad skeptical about making this purchase but Im SO GLAD I DID! 10 stars!!!
"I get a lot of compliments on this shoe...It is comfortable, although the inner lining toward the toe pulls out sometimes when I take the shoes off. Overall a great purchase. I will look for this shoe in other colours."
Nice quality. A little low in the neckline (for my big 10 year old) but otherwise great.
"I love this wallet. It's a little stiff at first when it comes to closing the wallet, especially when you have change in the pocket. However, it stretches over time and I have no problems closing it now. There are plenty of credit card slots and a few nooks and crannies to slide papers or notes. I love the dual color. I have no problems putting paper money in the appropriate pocket. It's the perfect length with some room to spare."
"Nice,  comfortable true to size"
Absolutely adorable!!!! Colors are bright and it is very well made. Thick tee shirt fabric and feels great! Love it
"Absolutely gorgeous! Arrived on time, perfect condition and very reasonably priced! A perfect gift for a hospital patient to wrap around her shoulders."
I bought these for y 2 year old daughter. They are soft and comfortable. Tru to size. I've washed them many times already and they remain soft and haven't shrunk.
"Purchased for my niece who is 7 and wears a size 1M which is the size that I ordered. The heel height was fine, the  fit was perfect and they were comfortable for all day wear.
The shoe is adorable, she loved them and they look so cute on her foot. They are for dressy occasions and barring foul weather, could be worn year round.
They arrived beautifully packaged, in perfect condition.and on-time."
"I love this product! It's totally adjustable in the back and has a zipper extender for the front. There are two slits in each cup, one horizontal, one vertical....which makes for a snug hold on the pump while in use. Simple, convenient, and provides relief from having to hold or prop the pump while in use. Well worth it!!!"
Its been difficult trying to find these boots.  I got them for a good price and there exactly what I was looking for. fast shipping.  Overall very happy with the product and the transaction
"For my first ever pair of boots I must say I made the right choice. I love everything about them, I was a bit nervous about the sizing though, but the size I ordered in relation to the heel height is perfect. They feel totally different than a pump or a sandal type shoe, they have a feel totally their own. I pulled them out of the packaging and was blown away at how sexy they are, I definitely will buy them in black and that won't end my boot purchases. I plan on a few knee high as well as thigh high styles."
My twin granddaughter loved them! They are very well made as well.
"Very beautiful. Just the right size to wear any time. I would definitely not get the smaller ones, as i think they wouldn't show good. These are big enough, but not too big. Matches the ring i got from them too. Next is the pretty matching bracelet. Sparkling and nice quality. No one would never know, their not actually real diamonds. Great price too."
My son wears these with his warm weather uniform.  He loves them and likes not having to worry about lacing his shoes.  Repeat purchase each year.
Fit perfect and look very nice.
Love how this shirt fits and feels.
These are a nice pair of shorts they fit well and they are good quality material
"I ordered a large which is usually good for me but I have big arms so the sleeves were a bit tight.  The dress came quickly and looks as it is presented.  I will order again, but I will get a different color one size large because of my arms.  Thank God the dress has some ""stretch"" in it.
It is almost empire waist.  I will wear with a belt...Good buy"
"Not as nice of a finish as I had hoped but the color was spot on. The fit is definitely right to buy a half size smaller, I usually wear a 9-91/2 and the 81/2 fit perfect.  Would definitely recommend!"
"My wife got this for her Gender reveal party, it fit her perfectly at 5 months and now at 9 months it still fits her great!"
ery pretty. Bought one for myself and another as a gift.
just very snug to skin but overall still an awesome bracelet...
"Totally exceeded my expectations!!! Back story: I'm not one of those super confident, super sexual beings. I don't LOVE my body (size 18 about 265) but I don't HATE it either. However, wearing this I kinda became one of those super confident, sexual beings!! Opening the package it comes extremely compacted and was jarring to say the least but the fabric is very, VERY stretchy, soft and comfortable. It sort of reminded me of thick, nice pantyhose type of material. Let's not forget what it's for it lingerie and I paid a whopping (not) $12.99. For this price, smooth texture of the material and the way it perfectly fit over fleshy, jiggly, far from perfect body and made me feel and LOOK super smoking hot AF I'm getting one in EVERY color! Styling notes: It had enough material to adjust it on my body. I chose to pull it down a little more to cover love handles and that too meaty, fat part where my thighs and butt meet. Also, because I am neurotic and insecure about my boobs sagging I wore a black sports type bra under neath it (FYI BF didn't notice until he tried to take it off and saw it wasn't attached, like he cared). I also bought 2 pairs of thigh high stockings from Amazon that surprisingly fit over my enormously gigantic thunder thighs. For underwear I decided to go commando. I told you I was feeling myself ;) by the time I got it on feeling sex enough no to wear any.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IYISS-Women-s-Seamless-Hollow-Out-Fishnet-Chemise-Standard-N-Plus-Plus-Fits-XL-3XL-Black/dp/B01FB15POS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IYISS Women's Seamless Hollow Out Fishnet Chemise Standard N Plus (Plus Fits XL-3XL, Black)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plus-Size-Hosiery-Black-Fishnet-Lace-Top-Stay-Up-Silicone-Thigh-High-Stockings-5x-6x-26-28/dp/B00M9NJ7HI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plus Size Hosiery Black Fishnet Lace Top Stay Up Silicone Thigh High Stockings 5x/6x 26/28</a>"
"just got it today.  looks pretty, low profile which is good.  Will see if it stands up to my daily abuse.  very pleased with it now."
Well it's a nike firm ground soccer cleat.  They never fail me and it has lasted an entire season plus a brutal 6 back to back game tournament.  No broken stitches excellent made cleat.
Great for use with shirts and dresses that a bra is not an option!
A great and soft shirt
"Very attractive , but a little small, might have to return."
What's not to love about some pink platforms! Wish this brand had a wide fit at times though.
"Can't believe it fits even my big noggin, with the cord loosened all the way of course. So happy with this cute hat, I bought a second in another color. I'm sure it would fit the tiny pin head types too,  since the fit is easily made smaller."
My 4yr old grandson loves his Lion Guard characters especially this little lion.
Solid bra..
My son ordered this by mistake and didn't want it. It's very nice shade of blue and larger than expected. His older brother wanted it.
"You get what you pay for... one of the stones fell off when I first opened it, but I reglued it. Only wore it once so far and it wasn't too heavy nor did it irritate my skin which is usually a cause of concern for my sensitivities. I recommend it for the price! Nice statement necklace"
"I needed to replace my old long underwear and couldn't find what I had had.  So, I tried this.  Though I am 5'3"", I purchased a large size because of my bust size.  I wasn't sure how it would fit in length.  Though the length could be slightly shorter, it still work well.  The sleeves are a little too long but because of the material they are easy to push up slightly and they stay there, they don't slide back down.  The material is very soft.  I wear this under my top and am comfortable all day. I plan to purchase more of these."
"I purchased this shawl in black and it is lovely and very elegant. It was perfect for my New Year's Eve celebration in Charleston, SC. As an added bonus I got it at such a great price and received it quickly. Highly recommend this shawl and the seller."
"I received so many compliments at my nephews wedding. Thank you to all the ladies for your reviews. I had a feeling this dress would run small and I was right. It still fit perfect and looks classy, very comfortable. I was helping removing dishes from the table and spilled the plates on me, it cleaned up very well. I had another 5 hours in the dress and I couldn't even notice I spilled anything on me."
"These are a little snug, but very soft and cute."
I got this for my niece and my sister loved it! It was a hit for sure!
"I wear a small for a tight fit in most things from jcrew and target, and these are much the same... The arms are a bit small.  Washed without drying and their great"
"Original system to keep your shoes in very good shape. I always had those with springs, but this one do the job nicely."
I like this skirt ok..... Haven't worn it yet... Will review after I wear it a couple of times... I prefer the thickness of the skirt compared to other skirts made by this co. I still wish it was a little thicker
"Great value, good fit"
"Fits as expected, comfortable and looks good on me. Only problem seems to be that the purple dye seemed to have a residue from manufacture and it got on my hands and somehow transferred light purple stains onto my white closet door. Hand wash these right after opening the plastic wrapping, so you can avoid similar issue."
"I love this scarf, it is super soft and colors are pretty accurate with the picture. Maybe a tad bit darker."
Beautiful lapis lazuli necklace
Love the luggage it seems sturdy but will have to review after using.
"I bought small size.... Bought it for my friends bday.  She is ,5'3 and weighs 110 lbs.  It fits her perfect.  She likes it very much.  She says its really comfy."
my daughter loves the show and the ring
Super cute!  My five year old has narrow feet which makes finding mary jane style shoes especially challenging. These fit her perfectly!  She loved the flexible sole and thought the scent was so neat. I loved the simple design that will work with most of her outfits and of course (most importantly!) they fit her!
"It was cheap. It's comfy and soft. The material is fine. I can't imagine wearing it in any other colour than black though. I bought a small, I'm a size 0-2 and it's huuuge at the waist. Stays on my body though. I'll wear it as a beach cover up or something."
Great skirt but the colors look different. It's more teal and black. No hints of gray. Good for winter but not spring.
"This has been awesome!  This fits better than a disposable swim diaper and looks nicer too.  It has been a breeze to clean, even after our son pooped in it.  We were able to rinse it out and reuse it for the rest of the day.  When we are done, we throw it in the wash and it is good as new.  We will definitely be buying these each summer (as our kids need)."
Beautiful shoe of leather color and fit.  Would recommend to others. Superior to many other comparable for comfort and style.
A little tight but I can still wear them.  They look great.
Delivered on time.  She likes it so I do.
"These are light and comfortable--especially good here in Virginia. The fit is good, and they wash up well! I'd recommend them highly."
"I was inspired to get a Baggallini after my aunt lent me one to take abroad last year.  I couldn't remember which one she had, but I chose one that looked similar.  Her's ended up being considerably smaller than this one, but I'm actually glad to have ended up with the Avenue Travel Tote because the padded computer section easily holds my 13"" MacBook Air inside a Herschel case with no trouble at all...in addition to my iPad mini and a million other things.  It is constructed very well and seems to be of excellent quality--as expected.  I had hoped to use it as an everyday purse, but will likely use it as a carry-on on an upcoming trip and as a work bag.  Still looking for the perfect super casual purse, but this bag is fantastic. I must agree with other posters who noted that it does indeed seem bigger than advertised--but I'm not complaining!  Still looks sophisticated and can easily carry it whether going to the library or to a work meeting."
Great Christmas gifts for the RN's
Fits great!!! Good quality. I purchased a size larger after reading other reviews and it's fine. I can tighten the front for my needs. I am 5' and 180 with DDD. The wings are pretty but I have should problems and get get them on- real feathers. Excited to wear out! Sexy but not overly sexy or trashy at all.
"Too wide around neck. Mind you I have a17 in neck. Like they made it incorrectly too much material in neck area. It's nicer than most but hopefully you get one that is made correctly. Still funny.

Update 11/27. Seller refunded my order without me even asking. Explained there was an issue on some units. Honestly it's very well built. And with a seller like that backing up his product I will order again.."
"the person who received it for a gift really likes the double knit for warmth and comfort, pretty also."
"This is a beautiful dress, unfortunately it was too small through the bust and waist.  I will pass it on to one of the girls in my family."
Good quality product with cheap prize.
"Good quality,  right fit. Perfect for my Brony and our daughter for opening day of the new My Little Pony movie!"
Fast shipping. This is a gift and looks awesome. Has a good weight to it. Thank you.
Love it. Exactly how it looks in the photo. Hasn't turned in a month(so far.)
Very bold and beautiful...I wear alone on wedding finger and also as right hand rings when I'm wearing my original wedding set.
"Great Hat!! The color was not quite as displayed, I bought the ""brown"" color which looks like a sort of pale grayish brown on the website and ended up being a nice rich warm chocolately brown when it arrived - very happy :) It came much faster than expected is very pretty, fits great, and seems to be good quality. I'm buying another one in another color now!"
Wear comfortablePut on feeling betterve been wearing Levi 505's exclusively since the early 70's. They fit me perfect. I could just walk into a store and pick up my size and buy without trying them on. Best jeans around.
"Well made, great size, so cute! I'm ordering the red one soon!"
"so cute, it was perfect for a photoshoot when she was 2 months.."
Great kit for the money.  Have used to restore many shoes.  Having two brushes are a must if you have brown and black shoes.  Don't try to use one for both.  The box it comes in works well to store everything.
This is the first Columbia pullover I have had. It fits like the Benton Springs zip-fronts. I have several of those and I love them.
"My favorite bows for my 4 month old! Soft, stays in place, a color to match any outfit, doesnt leave indentation around head. Fantastic!"
Very feminine and made with good support. Wire is light and flexible. Good side support and comes with hook extension.
I got these for my mom and she loves them.  She said they are so comfortable she almost forgot to take them off to go shopping.
This was a Christmas present and my niece loves it.  Fit her perfectly.  It is really cute -- will be looking for more to order from this company!
"great hat.
bought 2"
"Cute, color for navy is a lot darker than pictured.  It's long enough for leggings though, and soft."
Looks very good in my son.  I love the style...very classic
These fit great and stay cool with an adequate amount of venting.
"I was a little sceptical of the waterproof status, but they are stamped waterproof and behave waterproof.  Lots of stitching on the material faces, which I appreciate as the better alternative to adhesives.  The soles are solid and nicely contoured.  After several weeks of summertime wear, they feel great, don't smell bad, and seem to fit better each day.

Now to make sure my labrador doesn't eat them..."
Perfects replacement shoes
It actually fits EXACTLY as ordered... which was a little large for me.  Do not order LARGER than you are.
"Floofy, and still shedding some lint-pills after a couple washes each (thus 4-stars and mad vacuum -- vacuum is lazy), but they are comfy for the toes. They are thicker than what I'm used to, but all to the good, there. Most important is that I don't seem to need to adjust/rotate to compensate for an annoying seam."
Cotton. Fits great. MAGA
Having to send back because it's too small.  The size is off by about 1 size.  I had measured prior to ordering to make sure but the product is just made small.
"This hat really does make a statement. I had people asking to take pictures with my all night. However, be prepared to tweak the neckwrap portion. I know I have a very thin and small neck, but I'm pretty sure it's going to end up gaping on everyone. It has to be pinned back or sewn smaller in order to achieve the proper look as in the picture. Would be great if that portion of the hat was adjustable."
Perfect fit... great price
I live themmmmm!
"I am very pleased with these. They fit great, and I actually got drunk and fell asleep in them. They did not budge all night."
"Very nice boots, great for winter/snow and also for rainy days (kept my feet dry). Comfortable, not very high and true to size. My size is usually 12 and size 12 for this one fits perfectly. Note that I have wide feet but regular width was ok. I would NOT recommend you go down half size as other reviews stated unless you're in between sizes."
"This bag looks a little small but it holds so much.  Several zippered compartments, stiff bottom w feet, strong zippers and a great contemporary print. The shape is unique  I love it!"
GORGEOUS JUST ORDERED ANOTHE  ONE
"I'm 156lbs and I ordered a size 10 and it was too big but I'm goin to take it in, the material for this dress is amazing...
I would be ordering anothe..."
Soft and comfortable. Does not look flat. Full head coverage.
"Very comfortable, great fit, pleasant colors, and they wash beautifully."
"I'm a 5'11 girl and I usually wear an XL in girl sizes sometimes XXL if I can find it. So you can imagine why I love these kind of shirts (aside from me being a total HP fanatic ) I got an XL and it's a bit baggy and long and since I rarely find that, I'm ecstatic. Long Love Gryffindor! :)"
These sandels are are gorgeous. I love the color and the fit is perfect.
Love these super comfy shoes!
"Beautiful dress, very comfortable fits great! I will be buying more!"
"They look great, are warm, and ventilated. Can't really complain about them. The only thing is the elastic in the waste isn't too stretchy, which wasn't a problem for me per say. But for someone with a sensitive waste, it can be uncomfortable."
Super watch!  This model has been made since the 1990s and has stood the test of time.  Well made and does what it is supposed to.  Great low light and night time visibility and having a second timezone indication is great when traveling or communicating with a remote office.  I purchased mine several years ago on sale from chronometer(dot)net and it came with 2 year warranty.  Marathon stands behind their products!
Were stiff & hard to get on at first but did loosen up after wearing. I'm glad I ordered a half size bigger as they are a bit narrow. It sure has been nice to have dry feet while out walking. With more use they have become quite comfortable.
Great quality but transparent material and too small.  Fast shipping and great customer service.  I would definitely order from them again
I really love this night shirt.
Only complaint is there's no opening to go pee.
"Husband really likes these bought my husband four different brands of higher quality brands and these were his 3rd favorite. They are super soft and he says they are super comfortable. They are really nice in the support area and they are comfortable in high heat work environments. He works construction. Legs don't ride up. They wash well on cold and low temperature dryer settings. He would definitely recommend these. The reason for four stars is he says that these do have a wedgie issue sometimes.

Just for reference the others he tried and liked better were obviously which are 20+ for one pair. My package also 20+ a pair. And champion 10$ a pair. So money wise these are a good by 24$ for four pair."
We have a family of four and this made traveling so much more organized and easy!
"Nice and soft , well made"
Comfortable boot. Arrived sooner than expected.
Great blue ADIDAS SHOES!
Good pair of shorts.
Amazing quality amazing price!  Highly recommended!!!
"Thick harness leather..Heavy duty buckle..masculine..color is a very dark brown, almost black..tip is long enough to cut off an inch and punch another hole if too long and still look right.  I would not recommend moving the buckle..it can be done, however you will have to cut the stitching where buckle is secured. This is thick solid one piece leather, not the bonded crap. Very happy with this purchase."
My husband is 6'4 and a man-sized man. He loves these shirts!
"Excellent product.
This was the second time that I ordered the same size."
These are Great Checkbook Covers. Better than expected!
Great underwear! Nice colors (although who will be looking?) and great construction. Probably will outlast me. Price was very reasonable. Here are the four more words that Amazon requires for a finalized review!
Good fit and washes well.
"Love this, very comfy and cute. I have a chubby lil guy and fits him great"
"I love Cotton Cantina yoga pants figured I'd love these too
Overall, I do love them
Soft cotton material, softer as you wash
I'm 5'2"" 115lb and they fit snug, could see them being to short for gals with a booty since the inseam is pretty darn short.
Fit as expected, but tend to ride up a little bit, I expected that from short shorts though
Because of that, I'd never wear in public except under a dress or long shirt maybe.
Use them for yoga at home and lounging, happy with that

Plan to buy again!"
Adorable hats for newborn.....the fact that they are cotton is a definite plus....very soft on babies head and not itchy
"Bought for my 12 year old, this umbrella is feminine and girly enough for her without being overly juvenile. I surprised her with it and it just happened to be a rainy day and she used it immediately...she loves it!"
"I lost count on how many LL tops I have. Super soft, high quality material. Looks great, feels great!!"
These are very cute. They were a little wide but with the ribbon it helped.
These socks are very comfortable. They fit perfectly and they are keeping my feet very warm. Highly recommended for anybody looking for warm socks!
True to size and really comfy.
Beautiful fitting
"I have fallen in love with Crocs. I use to think they were so ugly and never even tried them on. However, while searching the internet for some Star Wars shoes I came across the different versions that Crocs had available. They caught my eye so I decided to order a pair just for kicks. Best decision I have made because I now see why people love these shoes. They are incredibly comfortable and I forget that I am wearing them most of the time. I liked them so much I asked for another pair for Christmas. I was hoping to get the Chewbacca furry crocs but I guess I put down too many options and wound up with the Dark Vader crocs. Which I also love. I may break down and just buy the Chewbacca crocs before it gets too warm to enjoy them. I usually wear between a size 7-8 in mens shoes so I went which the size 8. They are roomy and comfortable and I like to wear socks with mine. The length is good so I am glad I did not get a size 7 as my toe may have touched the end of the shoe. All in all Crocs has gained a new loyal customer."
Ordering another color
"These are so perfect, everything about these are perfect!!! I'm gonna get different prints cause they are just too perfect!"
"I had purchased a pair of Old Friend slippers like this for my husband, and the lining was ruined within a month. It would have cost $19 to replace the lining, so I just bought some of these as a replacement. They are a much better quality product and my husband loves them. I also bought a pair for my daughter and son-in-law and they love theirs, too."
"My wife loves her new boots. They look great and keep her feet warm. She wishes they were a little taller. My wife wears a size 5.5 shoe, we got size 6 in the boots and they fit perfect."
"Love these and get a few pairs every now and then to wear for years! Toss in washer, and allow them to air dry, which takes about a day. They are comfortable and long lasting! I recommend them!"
"Gotta say, way better than I expected. I ordered before reading the reviews and had expectation that these might show up and be horrific. The boots that showed up were/are pretty much indistinguishable from the Uggs in terms of looks and while they aren't going to last my wife 4 years, they are totally going to be around for a year or two."
"I  this pants
Comfy and cute"
This set is really handy for travel as well as for the gym.  I use several of them for various items for the gym.
Bought this for my boyfriend who owns a Jk. This is now his favorite shirt. Awesome design.
Awesome...love the fit. Warm and comfortable.
sandals feel great but wish they had alittle more arch support
"Cute dress. I'm 5'5"" and 125 lbs. Size small fits just perfect."
"I love Ecco shoes.  I have a slightly wide foot and these sandals fit and feel wonderful.  I have bought and worn Ecco walking/workout shoes in the past, but these are the first sandals I tried.  From the minute I put them on, I could tell they were winners!  Snapped up three more pairs."
love these coats
I love Lexi Myrtle Sandals and have four different colors.  They are comfy right out of the box.
My daughter really likes these sandals.  The speckled silver design is prism like as the light shines on it but the purple stands out more.  Velcro makes it easy for 3 to 4 year old to take on and off.  They don't rub on her skin and comfortable from the get go.  Well made.
I love these shoes- so bright and summery!  Rocket Dogs are my favorite brand.  Their a bit wider and just oh so comfortable and everyone always asks where I get them
They are perfect for water walking in the pool
"This watch is just something. Every time I wear it, I get one than one saying ""wow, that's a very nice watch"" or ""did that cost a lot?"" I would buy this watch over and over!"
"This is SO cute. I bought it for my brothers girlfriend for Christmas, she really liked it and I will probably buy myself one later on."
"The cushioning and arch support are not like the older Electra Sandals I have.  I've been buy this sandal for the past 6 years and have loved them.  These are not bad, but not as supportive as the older ones were."
"I am 5'4"" and 1/2, weight 120 and I ordered a size 3. They are a little snug but overall they fit except in the length. They are too long, so much that when I try to roll them, they are too thick at the bottom but I have short legs this problem often with jeans. But overall the quality is nice and for the price I will alter the length myself."
I assume this was okay.  I bought is as a gift.
Let me start off by saying if you have a problem let them know ASAP it gets resolved very quickly as for the Items great stuff for a great price Always wanted a Dead head sticker on the back of my car just as Don Henley sings about cool stuff great seller thank you for everything!
"I use these for when I go to swim.  Easy on and off, good price, and much better than thongs"
comfy and great for wearing with racerback tanks
"My favorite, I ordered another in black, a size down.. The fabric feels like bamboo, so silky, not heavy, fluid, but weighty, not cheaply made.
Feels way more expensive, the color is very saturated, and rich. The brown is a deep Hershey cocoa color, and the black is deep, not muted or dull. Love them, will get more colors, a new favorite, and really well made"
It was very sexy but a little too big for me and it was size small.
The color is so bright and beautiful and it's very soft! I would recommend anyone get this scarf.
The material was too close to the zipper at the top so I just cut that part off.  Now it zips all the way to the top without catching.  Otherwise it is fine.
Best Necklace
Delicious feel!!!
Grandson LOVES IT
Purchased as a gift. Daughter loves them!
I am a waitress and the shoes are perfect to work in. I bought my first pair and I have got to other coworkers who are wearing the same shoe and love them. Highly recommend them. Super lightweight and easy to work in.
I bought four of these as Christmas gifts and they are very nice! I was pleased when I received them and cannot wait to give them as gifts in two weeks. I also plan to purchase one for myself.
Well made and a sturdy shoe !!
"Quiet and reliable, and lights up when spinning!"
Very pleased! Good quality!
"I really like this blouse and have ordered more. I am 5'3"", 160 (okay, 165) pounds, wear a 40C, and have a slightly bigger tummy than I should. After reviewing the sizes and several reviews, I ordered a Large. I am very happy with the fit and length, as well as the vibrant colors. I live in yoga capris/pants, and these tops work perfectly, covering my slightly over-generous butt (hence the reason for living in tight, compressing yoga pants). The material is soft and cool, thick enough to let ""the girls"" be free if you choose (like me). As far as washing, I wash with my colors on cold water, and then hang on a hanger to dry--no shrinking and no wrinkles. These are a great buy."
"I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves them! They are very stretchy and allow for a lot of movement. There's a slight shine to them. They seem to be pretty durable and that they won't wrinkle.

Pros:
Very stretchy
Durability

Cons:
None

Overall, these are a great pair of leggings and I would recommend these based upon my girlfriend's opinion."
This was a birthday gift for someone but she liked it!
I like this shirt.  The quality is good and it looks great.  It does run a little small.
"I like it and the color i recieved was correct. I ordered a xxxl which to me feals like a walmart size 22/24.  Even though the shirt has a liner underneath its still pretty see through and i feel that i needed another spagettti strap shirt under it. It doesnt offer any shape to us bigger ladies with big breasts. I either put on an adorable little belt to show my curves a bit or a cardigan to help accent my curves a bit. I do overall like it and will be buying a few more in a few other colors. Oh and someone mentioned the arm holes being to big or something like that, but i didn't  have that problem."
Just what I was looking for in a 2 day trip. Great quality and style.
"I ordered the sweater that was not a crop-top but an actual full length sweater that would cover my stomach. However, I still received a crop top hoodie in the mail, and it fits. It's comfortable and it looks nice, and since I only spent about $9 for the hoodie, I didn't bother returning it. When I first got it, it had an unusual smell but it goes away after you wash it.
The material is also a bit stretchy so I recommend just getting your regular size. If you want a bigger, baggier hoodie, get a size or two larger."
Great purse and price !
"It fits perfectly but I run out of outfits to wear with it that'll match the color. The color is like a mixture of swamp/forest/emerald green. I can only match it with either green of the same shade, black, or white. Any other color is kinda testing it.
Now all I need it a gold tone watch, and more matching clothes."
"Fit great, thanks!!  Joyce Capps"
Super cute! I love these shoes and it makes me feel good knowing they donate part of the proceeds to an animal rescue!
This  shirt is very well made. I like the neutral color because it can be dressy or casual.
Will buy again!!!
"This is truly a very thin wallet, the quality seems very good, and it's a nice deep-hued purple.  It's far thinner than my old business card holder that I converted to a makeshift travel wallet.  It slides easily into my front pocket, and has lots of storage for credit/bank cards, ID and money, both bills and change.  The only thing that would improve it is if the bill section was divided into 2 sections, as very picky folks like to keep their large & small denominations separate."
Love these- my 4th pair!
"A very nice hat.. Great quality, Priced well, wish I had one years ago..."
"It just looks fabulous! I don't have long legs, but with heels, it looks chic..."
"Good running/hiking shoe, I ordered a size smaller than usual and they're slightly tight but good."
"Love my crocs love my pink flamingos great  Beach shoes, Great around the pool shoes ,  anything around the water or sand they're great for little sweaty for the desert"
"I wash my hands all the time and work with my hands all day long, and sometimes the rings I buy get bent or rusted. This ring is perfect, it's dainty and just what I was looking for. I always get compliments on it, and it's lasted me about a year now. Still wear it every day, it's awesome!"
Beautiful!!!! And Witchy just the way I like it!!!!
"IVe worn the whole set once except the ring because i already had sum, but this looks great if you can really rock it"
This is the ugliest shirt. However the person it was purchased thinks it's the bees knees and is ordering one in a different color. The fabric is nice and the detail is very well done. It's great for someone who has old fashioned taste!
"I am a huge fan of Aerosoles, and these did not let me down! As a teacher, I stand for hours without sitting down, and my feet never hurt at the end of the day when I wear these shoes. The sole is thick enough that I can't feel the ground when I wear them. They feel like pillows for your feet.  I receive lots of compliments on these shoes every time I wear them.
The only thing I don't love about these shoes is that it is a darker leopard print. Most leopard print has a lighter tan background, but this one has a dark brown background. I think these are little dark to wear with black pants. This probably doesn't bother most people, but I wear a lot of leopard so I see a difference."
Good quality and good fit and fast international shipping  !!! Loved it  5 stars.
"Great color, quality and fit."
Great bag especially for the price! A nice large bag with a crossbody strap and handles. Had a divider in it. Does have a weird scent at first but can't beat the price and the quality is the kind of a more expensive purse!
"I was going to order a half size larger (8 1/2) but read reviews saying, ""runs a bit large"", so I ordered an 8- -perfect.  Haven't worn them longer than a couple of hours but so far they feel really good.  Yeah!  A comfy slip-on shoe for spring and summer.  P.S. Love the red color."
"Love this sweat shirt. Fits great, maybe slightly too big. Very warm, soft, and extremely comfortable!! Good quality and well made. I didn't like the tag on the outside bottom of the sweatshirt, but was able to remove with no problems. Great item!!"
"Really enjoy the comfort of these as I have really sensitive ears. I just wish they were a bigger stone because they are pretty too. Next order will be something in the 4mm size, already on my wish list! Great company, good prices."
Awesome...you will not be disappointed.. fits true to size..I haven't worn them as yet..but I  can't wait..Im only hoping that once I wear them my feet won't slide to the front..arrived on time..can't go wrong with Penny Loves Kenny.. thanks Shoe Metro..
"Love em, they look great and are comfy!"
IT WAS FOR MY GRANDSON AND HE LIKES IT.
"I tried on a 8 1/2 in the store. Length felt ok but shoe was tight. They did not have a size 9 so I have ordered a pair from Amazon.com I hope the fit well. I will keep you posted on the outcome.

Well the shoes are nice.  I love them.  The right foot fits well.  The left foot i a little tight and I have worm them approximately 3 times all day.

No one has really commented on them but I know the are nice.

Other than that I just think they are a little too expensive.

But they are different."
The best toddler snow gloves! These stay on and stay warm!

Plenty of room, lot of compartment options, used it as carryon in flights.

It is tad bit heavier but in return you get a really sturdy backpack capable of surviving in all possible conditions."
My son loves the sweatshirt
"Can't say enough good things about these leggings! All the stores by my house were sold out of the fleece lined leggings so I took a chance and bought these. So glad that I took the chance! They 5'5"" and 142lbs and they fit perfectly. They keep your legs really warm on cold days. They do smell a little bit like chemicals when you open the package but after washing them, they are fine. I like them so much, I will be buying more so I am stocked up for next fall/winter :)"
Bought these for my daughter and we love them. Such a classic baby shoe. She gets compliments on them every time she wears them.
Its wonderful that someone out there still makes REAL denim jeans.  I hate that stretch crap they make these days that they are trying to pass off as denim.  I want REAL denim jeans that do not stretch.  Every other manufacturer out there has decided that ALL women need stretch jeans and that seems to be all they make for women these days.  I HATE STRETCH JEANS BUT I LOVE MY WRANGLERS!
Bought for my mother in assisted care- Easy care- comfy-  fits good- not baggy-light enough color so her name will be seen in laundry-
"fit as expected, got on time, no complaints"
"Works as expected, high quality made in USA."
"Loved this hat.  Perfect for the playa.  Fit was also just right.
Unfortunately it lost its shape in the washing machine after it became stained.  I don't think I should blame the hat for that."
Works great for my project!
"I purchased these for my daughter, she loves them. I read other customers comments and alot of people said they ran small. When I ordered I saw they didn't offer half sizes. She wears a 7 and I ordered an 8...she says they fit perfect. I like the quality overall. Nicely made and will probably last quite awhile!"
These blanket sleepers are pretty decent warmth wise.  My 9 month old son is warm and comfortable in them.  They do run a little small so definately buy the next size up (I purchased the 12 month size and at 8/9 months they fit him perfectly.) I would purchase them again if he needed more.
great socks and great value
"After buying a pair of the Oakley Frogskins lx sunglasses, I soon realized that they were far too big for my face. They kept sliding off if I looked down, and I certainly couldn't flip them up atop my head if needed either because of how large they were. A friend of mine had a pair of the original frogskins, and I tried them on and found they fit my face much better than the lx did. That is how I came to purchase these original frogskin glasses. I couldn't be happier with my decision, as they fit my face quite well and allow me to look around without sliding off my nose and hitting the ground. The lenses are great and block out sun even on the sunniest days at the beach. I've always been a fan of Oakley, and this purchase just made me love them more. Great product."
Same as the footless tights. Just amazingly comfortable!
Its thin material so it keeps you cool. Its a bright color that hasn't washed away but do be carefull there is a little sticker that says if you machine wash it the color will go away
This is a very nice shoe but it was to short for me.  I had to return them.  I buy a lot of Naturalizer brand shoes because they make narrow width in smaller sizes.
"I find the material of this dress to be seemingly sturdy, though time will tell whether my initial assessment is correct or not.  However, as a short person, the length of this dress is too long.  It'd be nice if it came in a petite length.  The other issue that I have with it is that it takes a long time to dry on low heat.  After 40 minutes on low heat, it's still damp.  On the other hand, it has less rayon content than do other maxis on the market and it's nice that it can be thrown in the dryer.  The price is pretty steep too."
Love this outfit! So cute and perfect for fall!
"Perfect cat-eye. Subtle and adorable in a retro way, and not costume-y at all. The matching case is super cute as well, and the lens color is nice, too. It gives your vision a yellowish tint that makes it look like sunset."
Very cute casual cover up
The only thing I am not happy with is these are waistline jeans not mid cut.  Other wise happy with them.
Not a deep read but a dark pink which blends perfectly with my actual ruby.  Very attractive.
"Buy at least 1/2 size larger.
One of the best fitting and comfortable boots Ive had. Worn it 5 straight days and it still feels and fits like a glove. Hesitated buying it due to cost but now glad I did. I truly recommend trying it."
"I bought 3 of these for my family. I noticed that they most customs workers don't like covers on passports. They can be real snooty and just plain jerks about it. I don't care, it protects my passport. Soft leather, easy to put in. I really like it."
My daughter loves her outfit which of course makes me a very happy mom.  The pom poms look so much like the real ones.  And the outfit seems to be well made.  Thank you.
"I bought this Invicta Women's Pro Diver watch for my wife, as a Christmas gift.  She was very excited with it.  It is a beautiful watch and very rich looking!  I have purchased 2 other Invicta watches and find the quality and price to be outstanding."
"Love the pants, a little tight but that's ok. Very happy with this shippers product, have ordered 12 pairs in the last month and have received all orders within 2 weeks of order being placed."
A fantastic watch for the money! Very classic looking. I get compliments every time I wear it. Kenneth Cole makes a great watch.
Giving this belt 5 stars and will update later if this changes. Only reservation I have is longevity of the notches the ratchet locks into. If these hold up well this will be a fantastic belt. The issue of being between holes in a traditional belt is very well solved with this belt.
My daughter loves this boot.  I love the boot.  It fit her perfectly (true to size).  The boot is also stylish and warm.  All good here!
great product  wife love it
Love this bag. Worth every penny.
Got this for my 15 year old and she loves them. A little cheap but they where!!
"I've only worn them a week, but they wear as good as my last pair."
"This pair of Grasshoppers was the first time I tried this brand.  They are comfortable and even have machine washed them, and they held up very good."
Very pretty dress soft and the skirt is layered
I really like the fit.  I would buy them again.
This is a lovely bracelet.  I am so glad I bought it for myself.  :-). It has a nice pattern and plenty of shine. I recommend it.
Comfy sandals. I bough it for my mom and she loves them. She says they are very comfortable and beautiful. I really recommende. I will buy another pair or her
"Overall, this is a good bag. It was perfect for mine and my two kid's weekend get-a-away.

Pros-
-Price. This bag is very low in price for such a big bag.
-It's cute and girly.
-Spacious. It has a lot of room in it. My kids are two year old, and come with a lot of stuff. Aside from the normal stuff that goes into a diaper bag and food, I was able to fit everything we needed in here.

Cons-
-The shoulder strap is not comfortable when you have this bag full.
-The zipper gets stuck easily.
-The bag is cheaply made. It didn't tear or break while on our trip, but I could see it tearing pretty easily.

Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase."
"I normally wear a medium to large depending on the item - I ordered a large to be safe and this top is definitely snug. When I am in Bikram staring at myself in the mirror, I am keenly aware of the fat pushed up by the top of my leggings that is squished into a neat little roll shape by the bottom of the tank top. The top is good for larger-busted gals like myself (the ruching in the front gives a bit of a 'bombshell' look) and it definitely keeps everything in place for yoga -- and keeping me honest with my posture in yoga, I just wouldn't wear this out and about if I want to look my best."
"$11.00 watch.  I bought it in white, and it's a good simple time piece that should last me for a while.  At $11, I can buy a new one every year.  Cheaper than replacing batteries on some of my watches."
"Love these shoes, I bought them in several colors."
"Great basic shirt, with a flattering cut. Be forewarned, however, that it does shrink in the wash. However, I find it fits me better now that it has shrunk. The color (a raspberry color) is vivid and didn't fade after washing."
Absolutely love it heavy duty belt
I wish shopping for myself were as easy as shopping for my husband online!
"This shirt is slightly transparent. If you're extra modest, make sure you have a tank underneath, or don't go anywhere there might be light or sun to shine through. Otherwise, rejoice in your ability to show the world your bra!"
"Amazing set! If you want  your shoes looking at their best, get this product!"
"Good, except the little handle on the inside often get caught on things when I am trying to put stuff in the bag."
"Love this bag. I feel secure that my belongings are safe. Easy to access. Lots of compartments. Don't know why people are complaining that the bag ""pills"" their garment?"
"Finally -- concealers that don't cause a weird crease! These are more expensive than some of the others, but they actually work perfectly. Yay!"
"I've had these Dansko clogs for over 5 years and they are super comfortable for walking or standing.  In fact they are the only shoes I bring along for trade shows where I'm on my feet most of the day.  They have great arch support and although they look and feel kind of heavy my feet love the support and feel great all day.  I got the cordovan color because I like the looks of it and because black seems so boring (I have so many pairs of black shoes, most of which I seldom wear because they aren't as comfy as these).  I find they go well with black, brown, and navy which are the main colors of slacks that I wear. They also look great with jeans.  The shoes are very sturdy and even though I wear them all winter, they haven't shown any wear other than getting a little scuffed up here and there.  But simply shmearing a little&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiwi-Cordovan-Shoe-Polish-1-1-8-oz/dp/B000MLBCU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiwi Cordovan Shoe Polish, 1-1/8 oz</a>&nbsp;on them and then lightly buffing makes them look all new and shiny again.

I normally take a size 8 medium in shoes but the size of these shoes that feel the most comfortable is a EU size 39 which would translate to a 8.5 to 9.  These shoes should fit a little loosely in order to be comfortable, and since I wear them mostly in the winter or cool weather I like to have room for socks.  But they don't feel too big without socks either. If you're worried about them looking too big, don't be. Because of the style they don't look large at all.  Because they have a heel that measures measures approximately 2 inches and the platform is about 3/4 inches, they make you appear taller too which I think helps with the appearance of looking slimmer.

Since these are mainly winter type shoes I decided to get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dansko-Women-s-Serena-Sandal/dp/B002PEWQYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dansko Women's Serena Sandal</a>&nbsp;for the summer, based on how comfortable the clogs have been. I'll post a review after they arrive and I've had a chance to wear them.  I ordered a size 39 in those as well."
"A little less pink than I thought, but still very pretty and have been worn often. great service"
"Really liked the pattern and got tons of compliments at the wedding I wore it to.  I wanted to upgrade my style to something a little more unique and modern and had been seeing these  in GQ magazine along with other fashion sources.  Definitely my new go to!  Make sure you use a smaller knot to tie it, or it gets really bulgy."
MY GRANDSON LOVES THESE SOCKS!!!!  THEY ARE VERY WARM!!
"I was skeptical when I ordered these as I've tried many no wire bras that did not deliver the support advertised. I'm a big girl, big busted and am tired, tired, tired of underwire bras. The Playtex bras give you all day support and comfort. The 'girls' stay where they should all day. They actually look good on too! These are now the only bras I wear."
"Great quality for the price, and the fabric has a nice feel to it.  Colors are rich (I bought red and black)."
"These make it much easier to organize a suitcase, especially when packing for a longer trip.  It puts an end to digging through your suitcase to find that pair of socks that has somehow worked it's way into a bottom corner.  It also makes packing easier.  Can't remember if you packed undershirts and maybe their on the bottom?  Instead of having to unpack the entire suitcase and repack it, just pull out the top couple of cubes and locate then one with the shirts then toss them all back in.  5 seconds of work.

These also help your suitcase from turning into a jumbled mess by day 3 or 4.  Everything stays organized.

My only complaint was the material these are made from seems kind of thin, so I'm scared to stuff them too much."
This is a soft and luxurious leopard print scarf. The print is pretty. I'll be able to wear this scarf in many different styles.
"Returned due to my ordering the wrong size.  It was my fault, lol. These bras are awesome and I have been wearing them for years. Guess paying attention when ordering is important."
I am ordering these to replace the same ones I bought over 3 years ago. They held up to repeated hot water / bleach washes.
"Since most of the Alegria shoes are quite roomy, I guess I just expected the boot to be the same way.  Maybe they are for some people, but the zipper would not fasten around my calf.  I do have extra large calves, so I'm having a local shoe shop add leather to the back of the calf seam so I can wear them.  The foodbed feels wonderful!  Since I haven't gotten to wear them yet, I can't give any further information.  The boot looks nice like you can dress it up or dress it down according to what you wear."
"I got the white 595 and love it! It's a thicker, slick material, and it's fits like a glove in a good way. I got a small and am 0/2, 32 c, 25.5"" waist. The small is perfect. I'm 5'4"", and it comes to about two inches above my belly button if that helps anyone else considering purchasing it."
"I get so many compliments on them and I tell people how great they feel to wear. It feels like you aren't wearing anything!
One negative might be the soles are a little slippery. I haven't fallen yet, but I catch myself walking gingerly on my hardwood and tile floors because they seem a bit slick."
"I wear these to work, (I'm a legal assistant) which requires a lot of stairs and standing for long periods (in the county I work in, at least!)These are comfortable and flexible. I would rather be wearing something without a heel, of course, but these are professional and totally wearable for long periods of time."
Low but not too low. Excellent coverage from and back. Good feeling against the skin. I highly recommend this product.
Good material that holds up to multiple washings.
"have worn these late summer and now through the fall with no problems. have washed them probably 15-20 times without color fade or shrinkage. they fit my fat butt well, look nice and seem to be pretty well made. love the deep pockets! will definitely buy again."
"Really nice concept, very durable, and is perfect for halloween. Can change glowsticks easily, so will definitely be using for Halloweens to come!"
"I wear a size 8, these are size 8 and fit perfectly."
"Fits a little snug from the top. Just one warning they get dirty easily and are hard to clean. Even if you wash the, they end up looking dark grey because of the texture on the shoe. I really wished they were easier to clean because they are so comfy and lightweight"
Great Gerber product
"This corset is AWESOME! It's just a costume corset but it does flatten my tummy and curve my sides. I'm 5'5"" and about 115 pounds and it is snug on me, so unfortunately, larger people may have issues, since it's only one size. The velcro in the back is SUPER helpful. I do have to velcro it in front and then twist it around, but that's how I put my bras on anyway so it's not a problem. I'm going to be using this for my LARP costume as well as a pirate costume, my renaissance faire costume, and probably lots of other things!"
Great replacement chain for my son's pocket watch!
Just what hubby was looking for.
Great shirt. Cut a bit large but reasonable. Cool in the sun. I'll be buying more.
"Look more feminine than I expected.
Very lightweight."
"I tested this with strong magnets to make sure it was actually silver (which is not magnetic) instead of stainless steel, and it passed. "
These are awesome! I wore them all over the UK this summer. They worked great during the day and dressed up skirts at night. The color is perfect and the gold accent added to the appeal. I love them and am looking forward to shopping (investing) in another pair of Sofft shoes soon.
I have a tough little grandson and he loves his jacket.  He receives compliments everytime he get's around men.
"This cap fits a little snug. Would be nice if the cap was long enough to fold the edges up, to double over the ears. It's not quite large enough to do so. Otherwise, the material appears to be decent quality and the hat is comfortable enough."
Used it for my wedding. Great product for the money
"Love this ring, it loots great on my hand with my wedding band and it looks like the real thing."
"Nice looking hat, well built and made in the U.S.A."
Very comfortable scarf
"This sweater dress was worth the money. The sleeves were long enough, the dress a little bit short but still office-appropriate. It was a little big but very comfortable."
"Got them in today and LOVE them! I was looking for a huggie earring to go with my other huggie and it looks amazing.  It fits nicely in my first piercing and locked perfectly. I have no doubt that it'll remain secure where they are.

**Update. I ended up buying a second pair to go with my first. Love these earrings! I don't have to worry about them falling out and can wear them to bed with no issues! I'm a five foot female with what I consider big ears and they fit fine!"
Perfect fit! Great boots!
"A bit see through, will have to wear a nude tank or go for something bright to show through.  For the price, i'm satisified."
"Overall good quality, the purple could be a little darker but overall good value"
"Nice shoe polish.  It took a little time to arrive but the wax was a good quality, not dried out or cracked.  It shined up my shoes beautifully."
This sweater is worth every penny and more!  My 9 year old loved that it looked grown up and I liked that it's modest and not sexy.  Now she can wear some maxi dresses that have tank sleeves to school when it gets hot out.  Thanks Amazon!
I got this flats for work and so far it has been comfy and fits well. Usually I have problems with shoes that tend to squeeze my toes toward the end of my day esp when I have been walking around but this shoes does not.
Very very comfortable!  Really cute. Love these shoes!
My husband loves the wallet. Top quality work.
Really help on those long days on your feet!  Cute print.
"Very cute shoes and very sturdy design. This brand runs a little narrow across the upper part of the foot, but are true to size. They're advertised as black and white but actually have a slight brownish tint to them. I really like them though!"
"I ordered these for my grandson.  Good construction, a little big, but will save them for when he is grows into it -- which will be in no time at all."
My daughter uses these for her private school uniform and says they are very comfortable. They appear very sturdy and I am pleased with this purchase.
"Having read previous reviews that stated the product was too long, I opted for the 24 month size instead of the 2 yr size. They are different, and since my two year old is petite for her age, most of her clothes are the 24 month variety instead of the 2T. The slip is light and comfortable and is perfect under dresses that are a bit too sheer or dresses that are scratchy. My little one wants to run around slip only she finds it so comfy. I'll buy it again in a larger size as soon as she grows."
This size and style are not easy to find. I am delighted that Amazon carries these. The shirts fit well and last a long time.
Adorable oneies
I have purchased many of these bracelets from different sellers and I am very pleased with this one. I looks just like the expensive ones for so much less. Very satisfied
very pretty earrings and they sparkle really nicely not sure how durable they are yet but we will see
Supper comfortable and toasty warm.  I really like them.
great all around T
"Very pretty. Came as described in a timely manner. Fit well and as expected. I'm a size Small/Medium, 5' 7"" 125lbs. 32D bust. Seems delicate so I will definitely only be sink washing it to not destroy the lace. Boyfriend went full on beast mode for it, so we're good."
"FIT WELL, LOOK NICE"
"Best crossfit sneakers around, got these at a good price and fast shipping"
Looks amazing! and Feels so comfortable
I have a rather large collection of watches. And I'm very happy with my Smith & Wesson. A nice piece for the collection
They stand out farther than expected but overall these are great.  I love having them staged in size like this.
These were just a little larger than expected. Not enough to send back though. They are very comfortable and fun. I love them and ware them everywhere.
"I didn't originally like these. They did really fit right and were kind of loose even though my baby has a large head at 6 months. After a few times wearing this, I started to like them more and more. There very soft and flexible. Most importantly they do not leave any marks and are a nice material. My baby doesnt mind wearing these headbands"
very nice product at a very nice price!
The sandals run big and that's why I'm giving it a 4 but otherwise beautiful and good price
I got the coffee colored purse hoping for a nice rich brown.  It's gorgeous.  It's like a shiny dark rootbeer!  Good quality and nice zipper pulls.  I will definitely buy another style from Scarleton.
"I bought these for lounging - they promised not to gape open in front.  Well, they do even though they are 3XB.  I wish they had a button or two to keep the front closed.  I am looking for such shorts but cannot find them."
"They are warm and so far, dry.  Walking around Mammoth Lakes CA, at 8000 ft. in the Eastern Sierra, it is pretty cold at night. I wore them with thin merino wool & silk ski socks. I ordered the ""Weimaraner brown/dove grey.""  The color description is off. I had a Weimaraner dog. They are taupe, not green and the boot is definitely on the green side, not brown. The laces are green, an army fatigue green.  Keeping them because they work. If the rings for the laces break, as some have reported,, I will go to the hardware store to get some metal ones."
The crotch ripped out after my daughter wore them one time.
A bit small but it's soft and has some give to it. It has decent support making it great for the post shower summer dress that you can leave the pool in. I find myself wearing it at home too.
"I wear a 13 4E width, and these fit perfect. The toe is rounded, not as pointy as on some shoes. This gives ample room for the toes, and seems to diminish having the toe bumping the front. My shoe was made in Vietnam.  The fit and workmanship are excellent. These are also very lightweight!"
seems to be nicely constructed. Only time will tell how it holds up. I bought it because of the zipper and still allows for easy access without opening the zipper. Great idea for travel. It should also hold it's shape in your pocket better.  The look is a nicely worn appearance. Grain leather marks gives it that lived in look. The packaging it over the top. It's worth buying just to see that.
"These glasses fit really nice. They wrap your face well and are extremely light. For the price they are decent quality glasses, but if you are looking for higher quality it is worth spending more money."
"I bought this scarf in CF Black. It is very soft, pretty warm, and hangs just right. I find infinity scarves are less work to wear than regular scarves too."
"Just got this in. Bought it for my husband for Christmas. It's really nice for a casual watch. The band is a much better quality than it looks in the picture. Now, I just have to see if he likes it! The band looked black on my computer and is actually quite green (as it says in the description). It's a nice deep green though."
"Got the size 8, fits perfectly as long as you've measured yourself correctly. Sturdy materials, solid brim and holds a bend well too if you want. Crown is a little higher than I'd prefer but not obnoxious. Great deal for the cost, and especially if you're ironing on your own patch."
"What a perfect bag to travel with!!! Made well, stylish, and holds so much!! So glad I came across it!"
Exactly as I expected! Perfect size to take to amusement parks!
"I wanted something fairly form-fitting and sexy.  The color-contrast looks great in person.  The fit is flattering.  Not much left to the imagination, but if you got the stuff, you'll be happy with these to show it off."
"Super cute, loved the cut and coverage. It didn't feel like a granny suit but modern"
It is very nice and well-made. It did seem to shrink so it got tight but over all a nice Tshirt.
Fit as expected. Excellent quality. Lightweight. Comfortable
"You can't beat it for the price, I am a plus size gal and it gives me a waistline, it is not straight up and down, will be coming back for more."
"3rd pair I have bought for my daughter, fit perfectly. She wears 10 in Nike and sketchers, and the size 10 fit her perfect. She says they are very comfortable, more than the comparable name brand"
"Love this shoe, so comfortable.  Someone mentionef they were tight in the toes so I ordered the wider shoe. They fit perfectly!"
love the quality and colors
"I have a somewhat wide foot with normal arches and these fit perfectly. I tend to have problems with sneakers because they fit snug and these provide plenty of wiggle room.

*UPDATE* I have had these a year now and have put them to the test and then some. I absolutely love KEEN! I even bought a pair of water trekking sandals for everyday use.
-Also got use to the thin insoles.

I wanted to buy again but they are no longer made. They have a waterproof version but I like the mesh they dry quick and are perfect for tropical areas."
"My wife wanted a medium size purse with a zippered section to hold I.D., credit cards, etc.  This was perfect for her.

As hard as it is to find what she wants, I'm tempted to buy a second one and stash it in the closet for later.

The leather odor was a little strong, straight out of the packaging but very quickly faded."
Best Mocs out there.
"I love these boots. This is the second pair I've owned. Each time, they fit like a glove right out of the box, with little need for breaking in. I've never suffered a blister while wearing them. They're a little pricey, but I'd say they are worth every penny."
Fit just as expected. Very cool and lightweight. Extremely comfortable
I bought a 10/12 for my 12 year old and it is a big small she is very small for her size and this is the size she usually wears. She loves the colors and the style.
Ordered a set for myself and loved them so much I ordered another for my daughter. They are soft and comfortable and I like the waist- it doesn't leave a line under your clothing. Lays flat! Definitely recommend!
"This is a nice corset and I can't say enough good things about it. I am an oddly proportioned lady high waisted long torso and this was the right style corset for me. It gives me an hourglass figure, pushes up my breasts, and looks good under clothes. The biggest reason I got this is for my back problems and this properly corrects posture and supports very well in all areas. I am a medium/ large and ordered xlarge and fits well. This is my first corset purchase and I would highly recommend starting with this one and can't beat the price. ( org $100 pd $20)"
Well-made.  Havent tried them in wet conditions yet.  Seem comfortable and water-tight.
"This watch may be the biggest bang for buck purchase I have made all year! Basic, yes. Simple, yup. Quality, definitely. The case is well finished and feels good. The size is perfect for a med/large mens watch. The design is great and not too ""Submarinery"". The face of the watch is well done with applied indices. The face finishing does seem to have a slight waver for the nit-picky people out there (depresses ever so slightly around the indices). A matte or satin face would be an improvement IMHO. The strap that comes with it feels cheap, but is really comfortable. Overall, I love this watch. It looks awesome, feels good, keeps good time and seems to be pretty durable. Although time will tell on that last one (durability), based on Casio's reputation on this front I am betting I am in good hands. Skip the expensive fashion-divers and get yourself this Casio.

**NOTE** The watch is 44mm-ish and the lug (strap) width is 22mm. The product description is incorrect."
I love the fit but I just wish the tread was better and didn't track mud everywhere.
I love this necklace! I have gotten so many compliments! I have sensitive skin and I didn't get a rash! I even accidentally wore it in the shower and to bed one night. Skin still is irratation free!
This ring is GORGEOUS! Even prettier in person! I've already had many compliments on it. Will be buying some more that are similar to it.
It is bulky
Highly recommended for pregnancy.
I wear a lot of white shirts for work... so I decided to buy a blue one instead to go with my blazer .. Surprisingly this is my new favorite shirt. One of the best shirts I have ever bought.
The ultimate kit to keep your boots looking brand new. Easy to use. No offensive odor. Even provides extra laces.
"I got this for my fiance to try out.  The price can't be beat and it arrived on time and is beautiful.  He has not started wearing it yet (waiting til after wedding, duh!) but it fits him nicely.  I will post again after the wedding when he has had a chance to really test it out."
"Great shoe, comparable in comfort to the Keen brand."
"Favorite style pump.  This is my second pair - slightly different style but same fit.  Super comfortable.  Would buy a third, fourth... time.  Still wear the first pair often.  Wore them every day for months, walking to work and back, to run errands, to go out dancing,. etc., an still in great shape.  Rubber bottoms scuff easily but it's a small price to pay for comfortable shoes that last."
"A great quality watch that's easy on the eye as well as the pocketbook. My first Easy Reader lasted about 4-5 years before the wristband wore out. This one cost about $10 less than what I would've paid @ Target (which is where I bought the first one), so it was definitely a good purchase. It's certainly not an extra-fancy watch by any means, but it's simple, it's reliable, and it does its job, and that's enough for me."
Wonderful maternity pants! Very pleased mama!
I received a lot of compliments.  The dress is very long though. I am 5'2'' and this dress is way too long for me. I need to get it hemmed. It looks and fits great otherwise
"They fit well and I worried about blistering on the back of the ankle on on the toes. After walking a day on the French Quarter, it did not even hurt. I forgot they were even on. Hands down, the best purchase of shoes I've made in a long while. Will track down other colors."
"these shoes feel comfortable, albeit slightly larger than I would've prefered (I am between a 7.5 and an 8, but on a shoe that runs large, I sometimes need to go to a 7.5 --- but I've always been, thankfully, warned by other reviewers that a manufacturer runs big for the size and ordered correctly).  these are not so large that I would need to return them, just a little larger than what I usually receive in an average 8.  color wise- these are much brighter than I expected from the pictures.  i expected these shoes to be redder than the actual color, which is a very bright hue - almost a pinkish red.  that's not necessarily a bad thing, but, for my tastes, these look more like pink of my wife's nike's than (for instance) the red of a pair of classic chucks. when you really sit and look at them, there is no question they are red, but, in passing, the brightness of the red makes them look pink.

overall, a good pair of shoes for the money."
"I own the older version of this watch. In 1989 I became a certified diver and need a reliable watch to go under with. I purchased the older version of the same watch back then and it is still going strong! I never gave it a second thought until last week when I had to change the battery. I took it in and asked the tech to check the water resistance on it just for laughs as I don't use it for diving any more. It passed the 200 meter test with flying colors! I was amazed but the tech wasn't because he know how solid the watch was and told me that it's one of his best sellers!

After 24 years of use, countless bands and battery replacements, the watch is still as amazing as the day I bought it. It shows it's age as coral and sand are unforgiving, but the watch is an amazing performer. I will never replace it with a newer watch because I want to see how long it will really last. I'll keep you all posted!"
Very cute. It's prettier than I expected and flattering. The deep V in the front is very low but very sexy!
The only reason this is 4 star is because it is NOT one size fits all. I am a 38C and this was way too small for me. It is really nice - well constructed. It has a lining on the front side. Unfortunate that it didn't fit but I won't send it back because my daughter already snagged it!
Its a little..well quite big but that's because I liked the color and it was not available in women's..so I should have ordered a size smaller in men's  I love it anyway it is actually made better than the womens.
Fun pajamas for a pj party!
Beautiful dress. Im 56 and 108 pounds. I bought the extra small and it looks and fits great.
"Soft, thick, and warm. My new favorite. They do run large, though. I usually wear a large, but a Medium fit just right. Much nicer than expected."
"You get what you pay for,also just like the other style studs with spaces in between.but makes a good addition to my collection"
"These Chippewa boots have broken in nicely and quickly. As this is my first pair of Chippewa boots and I've only had them a few weeks, I can't speak to their long-term comfort and durability, I can say they are off to a great start.  Looking forward to how these boots will age."
"Can't complain here. The price was cheap so did not expect much. And I did not want to spend $$$ for only a one time use for my growing boy. Everything fit great, and did not need modification. Just bought shoes and white underwear. If your child wears other than white underpants, then people will be able to see the color thru the slacks."
I purchased this for my recent trip to see the Aurora Borealis in Norway this past February.  It worked well to help provide insulation.  It doesn't suffice as the only underlayer.  It was pretty comfortable and stayed in place - no twisting and bunching.  It does pickup lint like crazy though.  Be careful when washing it for this reason - no sweaters and towels with it.
I love these sandals! They take a month or two to truly break in (meaning I stopped getting blisters after that long). That is the only drawback! I just put on some blister bandaids and it was no problem. These have a comfy sole and were perfect for my somewhat wide feet. I even wore these to Disneyland and they were quite comfortable for several hours of walking. Highly recommend!!!
Love these little booties. My mommy group suggested them and I'm so glad they did. The only shows that stay on my daughter's feet!
"as advertised
thanks
CB"
Cool glasses and work well
"I had these gloves on my saved for later list. I received a notification that they went down in price to $16.99. I immediately ordered along with another item I had on my saved for later to make the $35.00 minimum for free shipping and, bada boom, bada bing I received my order two days later.

I wear size large in a dress glove but in most motorcycle or bicycle gloves I have to order XL. I took a chance and ordered the Large and they fit perfectly! I went for a 45 minute bike ride and payed special attention to the gel padding and whether its placement was in the right spot. In my estimation it's perfect. Very comfortable. I don't generally use gloves with a hole on the back of the hand because I have experienced sunburn more than once. Gotta watch that.

Very happy these gloves. I would recommend these gloves to others."
CONF I
Love it. Exactly as advertised
"I would give them 5 stars but he hasn't worn them yet. He tried them on and they seem to fit. Based on other reviews, he'd normally wear an XL like in boxer briefs, but I ordered a size down and they fit great. An XL would be too big in the waist."
I bought this ring in a size smaller than I normally wear because a few reviews said it runs large. I think it runs a size smaller. I sent it back and may reorder a new one. It really is just as it looks in the picture.
"It is hard to find comfortable, flattering cotton knit capris but these are perfect.  I wear these around the house or on walks with the dogs.  Love the pockets, too (those are also hard to find in these types of pants).  Great products.,"
Received the item today. I like that it holds everything I need for my airline travel in the Fall.
"i bought this for my daughter,and she loves it..."
"I love my leather crocs! The fit is great, (I wear a 9). This is the 4th pair of leather crocs for me! I have two other pair in different colors of this exact style. The 4th, and original, pair I ordered I wasn't as pleased with because of the studs around the edge. Those get knocked loose and come out."
Order a size up - very cute and held up well.
it was a present for a star wars fan and he loved it.
"Asics were recommended to me by the PA of the Orthopedic surgeon that has replaced a hip and is currently treating both of my knees.

The PA has a similar problem with ""fallen arches""  and has found these shoes to be very beneficial for him.  And he was right!  They work perfectly for me!  I was surprised at the classic look of the shoe.  I can wear them with both dress and casual clothes!

When your feet hurt, you hurt all over!  I thought I was having ""gout"" in the big toe on my left foot.  Blood tests confirmed that I did not have gout.
My Chiropractor correctly diagnosed the problem as fallen arch that resulted in the big toe pain.  Now that pain is gone!

I would definitely recommend the Asics Gel-Foundation walking shoe to anyone with foot, knee or back pain!"
"This dress was very nice, but the arm opening was too big for my liking and the sheer arms showed more of my underarm and back than I would have liked.  I ended up returning it but only for that reason.  If you are ok with wearing something underneath to cover those areas or if that doesn't bother you then this would be a fine dress for you.  I am 175 lbs and 5' 7"" tall and the 14 fit well.  It did not cling or show every roll.  The lace came to just below my knee."
I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend for Valentines Day this year. It is two weeks away. I think this robe is very sexy and appealing. I received it on time and the robe looks even better in person than on this website. I can't wait to give this to my baby on V-Day. I hope she likes it. I was very satisfied with this purchase and I would recommend this others.
beauties
"I ordered this shoes for a friend . She didn't know her right size . So, the shoes didn't fit her it was too small. But from my experience with Go Walk shoes , I know they are perfect."
"I just received the Taupe color ones. I had to do some research, I'm a size 10.5 for athletic shoes, however for Clarks I bought a size 9.5 and they fit great. Just be aware of that and do your research so you know what size works for you. Great shoe, highly recommended!"
Love my sketchers! These hurt because of the leather strap at first but became very comfortable all in all!
the shirt is amazing! I love it so much! I got a small (obviously in men) it fits a little big considering I'm only 105 lbs. but it's perfect. the fabric is soft and it's exactly like the picture!
"Beautiful shoe which is why I bought it! It arrived on time and I was so excited to get it. It turned out to be a little narrow for my foot and I had to return them, sadly, as much as I wanted to keep them. The return was made with no hassle and my refund processed in a timely manner! I would recommend this product and it's provider."
The size and length fits to me. It gives comfortable feeling on my feet.
"I've been running in Asics Nimbus or Cumulus for years and they really are my favorite. Oddly, this pair was a bit on the large side. Maybe a fluke? But not worth an exchange."
"Love these socks! Super warm and comfortable, soft wool blend inside, not at all itchy. They stretch a bit after wearing a while and can feel a little big but wash and they go right back to size."
Amazing can't wait to wear them. Really easy to fit and wear.
This sandal looks better than I expected. They go well with anything. Can wear them to work in a casual setting. Can wear to church. Very comfortable.
I love this suit! I have gotten so many compliments! The back is adjustable so that is nice. I wore it all summer long and I bought another one for next summer just in case!
Im heading to Europe in a couple weeks and this will be perfect for shopping in the markets. Pretty modern pattern and folds small enough to fit in my purse. I am going to wash it to soften up the material a bit.
"Perfect fit. My girl loved it. In the end, that's all that matters."
The stones look beautiful and the bracelet fits well. Love it.
"Lightweight, great looking!  My husband says they are very comfortable."
I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review. This blouse is high quality fabric and stitching. The fabric is soft and the blouse is comfortable and is made out of 95% rayon and 5% spandex. This shirt is perfect for work or for a casual event. It is loose and has a slimming look without showing ugly love handles. I highly recommend!
very good :)
"The medium size fit me very well and the length hit above the knee.  I am 5' 8"" and 172lbs."
"LOVE these shoes....originally bought as an athletic shoe but I bought another pair for everyday use. Super lightweight, comfortable, airy, and flexible. They may run slightly wide....I usually wear an ""E"" or ""W/wide"" shoe but these are just fine in the regular width.... or it could just be that the fabric is so flexible that it works for both medium and wide. They're great looking too....I bought the saffron color and like it a lot."
Very soft and comfortable. I wear an women's medium top and I ordered a size up (large) so I could wear sweaters and heavier clothes under. I like this coat. I did have to return it as it started to come apart at the sleeve. I hope the next one doesn't fall apart. Keeps me warm during Midwest winters!
Excellent jacket. I've gotten compliments on the print. The material doesn't feel cheap and the mesh on the inside is soft and comfortable. What a great buy. 
"these shoes are so cute, look awesome, and are great quality BUT they run LARGE. I am usually an 8/8.5. After ordering an 8.5 bc 8 wasn't available, i had to exchange for a 7.5 because the 8.5 was HUGE. 7.5 is perfect so I'm happy

UPDATE: I wore these from 1pm til 12am and my feet felt AMAZING. I was at a wedding, standing for hours & dancing...it was like I was in comfy flats. Coming from someone who can barely wear heels for more than two hours at a time and has sore feet the day after, I want every girl (or guy if you're into that) to know that these shoes are where its at. I was so happy about how comfortable they were, I was bragging to every guest that my adorable shoes were $25 freaking dollars. best deal ever."
Pretty sleek leather racing gloves to go with my cool helmet for track day. Nice and comfortable. Makes for a nice grip on the steering whee.
I love this watch. No problems.
Nice lightweight material.  Washes well.  I love these!!  I am tall with long legs and fit below the knee.  Cool for summer wear.
"It is so warm and comfortable, I love it."
Bought this for my 15 year old son for school. Clarks never let us down. This shoe is strong and very comfortable. This shoe is worth the money I spent for it. He loves the shoes!!!!
Have ordered in multi colors and they just make an outfit/costume POP!
for thin children are recommended
"1st let be begin by saying that these ARE NOT .. AMAZON EXCLUSIVE! You can find these at 6pm or Zappos, but Amazon does have fast delivery so I purchased these (as a gift), The receiver is my mother who I lovingly call my Raccoon (she loves anything bright and shiny). SHE LOVED THESE SHOES AND THEY ARE NOW HER FAVORITE SHOES TO GO WALKING AND TO THE GROCERY STORE."
This is really pretty! Much better than I even expected. I got it on lighting deal. I wore today and got so many compliments. I got a medium and probably could have gotten a small but the medium is cute too. I want a few more of these!
"Very comfortable, like no other sandals that I've had in the past.  I am planning on ordering another pair."
Better than I thought and the price was good!
Great and fast shipping!
VERY NICE RING--STONES ARE NICE--BUT METAL IS A BIT DULL--WILL WEAR WELL AS A WEDDING BAND--ESPECIALLY FOR THE MAN THAT LIKES A LIL BLING TO HIS RING--VERY POPULAR--MANY COMPLIMENTS  RECEIVED--TOLD THEM IT CAME FROM AMAZON
"I am a hard fit when it comes to shoes, and these are absolutely the most comfortable ones I've owned.  I can wear them all day, anywhere I go and never get tired sore feet.  They are my boot of choice when I enter my closet.  Perfect heel height, completely padded, and true to size.  I typically have to swap to a different shoe every day as my feet get sore and they all rub in different areas, but not with these.  Great looking and extreme comfort for those hard to fit feet!  You will not regret purchasing these boots."
I purchased this hat for my Carmen Sandiego costume.  The hat arrived in great condition and looked even better in person.  I added a yellow ribbon around it and it worked perfectly.  The floppy part is also perfect for trying to do the whole covering the eye thing Carmen Sandiego does.  I would highly recommend this hat for that costume!
"I received this necklace yesterday, in a beautiful, elegant box.  The necklace is truly unique.  It is the perfect length, it sparkles across the room, the gemstone, the Druzy itself is remarkable.  Itis in perfect proportion with the length of the necklace and the size of the stones.  Although I received this at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review, I am ordering two additional necklaces for my daughters."
"It is so perfect! fits exactly as described by there measurement chart! and it's perfect for my long torso!
It is definitely steel boned, but not with SUPER restricting bones and it's super comfortable.
It got here early, in perfect condition.

It's a little tricky to close the busk in the front, but I attribute that to the length of the busk and the steel boning, not because of poor design. It is also fairly easy to lace up on my own too! To lace it up I work from the bottom to the center, then the top to the center. The lacing doesn't slip and loosen when you let go, making it VERY easy to lace it on your own!
The waist obviously isn't as dramatic since you have to work your way to that kind of waist, but it's still fantastic!

Will definitely be buying from this seller again! <3"
"it is a beautiful mask. i have a larger sized head and it fits fine too. keeping it on for a long time would get uncomfortable but that is not my purpose.
i was looking for a mask to wear to the door when strangers knock. i live in a place where solicitation is not allowed but they come anyway and it is irritating. they want to wash my carpet for free. they want me to come to their church. they have vacuums, magazines, you name it.
i asked someone at work what they would do if someone came to the door with an animal mask. he said he would just walk away. this is what im aiming for.
if they actually talk when i open the door, im considering growling."
"I ordered brown, but received black, but what the hell, they are really well made, and I am quite satisfied with the quality and appearance of the product."
My Rolex Oyster never keeps the right time nor the right date.  I put it in a nice box in my closet and bought this easy to read elegant example of simplicity in a time piece.
Vest was kind of short. Guess I should have ordered a tall.
"I had almost given up on getting jeans that fit right and looked nice. SO glad I took a chance on these, they are perfect, actually long enough and comfortable. I'm ordering another pair today."
Cutest little dress!
"The watch looks just like the picture. It's very cute and classy, with a modern touch. I especially like the grey rubber strap because it's so comfortable. It also comes with an alternate watch band in the rose gold color to match the face, which I didn't realize when I bought it."
Fit well just a little short for a 40 waist so be careful.
"Good pants. I have several pairs of these now as they fit me quite well. Not too slim as to look silly but they are slim through the thighs and in the seat. There is some variability in sizes as one might expect in mass-produced pants at this price. These fit tighter in the waist than a pair of blue sharkskin pants, but less tight than navy pinstriped pants of the same model. Length appears to be pretty consistent.  6'1"", 170lbs for reference. 32x32 fit well, as I prefer these in between no and half break. They fit about the same through the thighs as Levi's 513 jeans, but are straight from the knee rather than tapered. Not as full as the Levi 514. Length shouldn't be compared to those low rise jeans, though, as the waist on these pants is NOT low rise. They would look silly if you attempted to wear them below your natural waist. I would like maybe another half inch let out, but it's not worth it.

The amount of fabric left in the hems is more than average when you to have a tailor hem unfinished dress slacks. I imagine this is to permit greater flexibility in letting out the pants. It does, however, mean that the pants do not lay quite as well as unfinished pants that are hemmed -- especially if you are wearing them where you have a full break.

Amazon shipped these in a plastic bag, wrapped in a plastic bag. Plan on pressing them and hope the post doesn't puncture the bag (and the pants). Mine were fine but it seems a distinct possibility that SOME shipments will be damaged."
"It is a great buy and it fits well. However, I wish it had more grippers on the toe area so that when I do the plank, I have more stability from slipping and therefore greater anchored to the floor."
"The design on these leggings are awesome.  I love the uniqueness of the detail.  The material is very sheer, cannot wear in colder weather."
"I absolutely love these shoes, they fit perfectly, they look fantastic for business work or even business casual look at the office. They are lighter than se of my other Kenneth Cole shoes. This was a good purchase."
My wife was happy with ware that.we had a great vocation in Hokkaido in Japan in Chinese new year.she said boots is pretty good in snow athere.
over the last few years i have for one reason or another have gone through a bunch of different wallets which had never lasted long . they ranged from $ to $$$ and sort of settled on the lower priced items and not being so big on Names. well this Wallet is worth Every penny . from the moment you see it you can tell that it's great construction will and has lasted . it's a definite recommondation on my list .
"Great arch support and lateral support!  The first time I used them during a workout, it was uncomfortable for the first 10 minutes.  After that, they felt so comfortable!"
I don't know why they didn't send the matching pocket square the same day as the tie when both were ordered together?  But both are good!
"REMEMBER THE GOLDEN GIRLS AND DOROTHY BUYING SHOES FOR SOPHIA (her mother)? Well this is what it is like with me buying shoes for my 94 year old mother. She has problem paws and always was conscious of the fact that she has ""man-size"" feet (and no, she is not trans-gender; she is my biological mom). These work well for her and she can still wear her (faux)mink and look very fashionable in crocs!!! I AM SO PROUD OF HER!!! AND I DO NOT MIND HELPING HER OUT WITH FASHION IN HER GOLDEN YEARS. Hell she let me sew on her Singer @ age 3!!!"
"My husband loves Port Authority shirts. They are well made, last long and have a true to size fit. He also loves that they have both short and long sleeve."
Great option for warm weather! Very comfortable in no time at all.
Great quality. Comfort waist is amazing. Fits as expected even tough I have a muscular butt.
So cute and comfortable...I wear a 9.5 but purchased a 10 because Nike run small... perfect fit
This is a great hat!! Fits perfectly on my head.
very affordable & nice color.
I have been a long time buyer of Hi-Tec shoes. They fit well and wear like iron compared to others I have worn. The Flagstaff shoe has decent support and is comfortable.
These laces are ideal for anyone who has difficulty tying their shoes.
"My original Casio sports band was tearing so I bought the Casio replacement band.  The band itself is great and is an excellent replacement.  It fit the watch perfectly (25mm width and 16mm spring bars).  I originally bought my watch (the G-Shock AWG1001A) in 2010 which is little older than the G-Shock models listed in the band description.  I was able to perform the replacement using a small 5mm flat blade screw driver but if you want an easier time I strongly suggest you buy a watch spring bar tool for spring bar removal and insertion.

My only criticism is the lack of a diagram showing how to do the replacement.  However I did find videos posted on the web that walked through the procedure.  If you neeed a replacement band for your G-Shock watch then I highly recommend this band."
"I normally wear a 9.5 but it's slightly too big, which is why I gave it minus 1 star.

The over all style and quality of the shoe is exactly what I expected based on the description and images of the shoe. I've had Steve Madden shoes before and they are not the most comfortable shoes out there but I won't be standing all day in these shoes so they work for me. As for the quality of the shoe, the stitching seemed to be fairly good and my previous pair of Steve Madden shoes are still holding up despite being several years old so I would expect the same out of these.

I ordered a half size smaller and will update my review after I have worn those in a bit."
Good quality Leather...Beads cheap...took a long time to arrived
bought 2t-3t and then bought 4t-5t for when he outgrew them. good socks. works well.
Like :Good for working / recreation in hot weather.  Dislike high prices
"I LOVE THIS LITTLE RING.  IT IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.  THE PICTURE DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE.  I AM SO GLAD THAT I DECIDED TO ORDER IT.  THIS SELLER HAS NEVER ONCE DISAPPOINTED ME, AND I MOST HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.  NOT A LOT OF MONEY---BUT SURELY A LOT OF HAPPINESS!!!  THANKS."
SO CUTE !!
"This is my new go-to bra. Fits very well. And it looks nice under clothing. I wish it had just a little more padding for when I'm wearing thin t-shirts and blouses. Other than that, it's great!"
Big! Cute! Perfect for this sunny state!
Good items. Kids love them.
I purchased this necklace for an eight year old girl as a Christmas present. I was told she likes all 'girl' things and was excited when she received this necklace. I had the necklace shipped to me so I could make sure it was what I expected and I was happy with the appearance and quality.
"This is my wedding ring of choice, after searching with the help of my now wife, for something that would be extremely sturdy with a dark wood grain built into it. Tungsten is an excellent material choice which doesn't cost much at all, and it looks just like silver with none of the drawbacks. This thing takes damage like it's nothing, leaving no trace of very hard dings against various surfaces throughout the day. It has a dark color tone to the metal while still catching light with a rich feel to its overall outward appearance. The Koa wood inlay is very well done and does not separate from the metal like many rings of this type seem to, according to many Amazon reviews I read on other rings like this one.

Overall you cannot go wrong with this purchase"
This dress was perfect for my daughters first Christmas. Prittier in person!
"I felt compelled to write a review to these earrings because many have expressed certain dislikes with the design and the quality.
The covering in the back that gives the crystals the sparkly blue-green color is not very noticeable, the front of the crystal is vibrant and colorful.
The shape and the size are perfect and will complement and face shape and complexion. As far as purity of metal, I will be able to know soon, since I'm nickel sensitive, but so far these earrings have been comfortable and secure in my ears. The absolutely do not look cheap. They could have been packed nicer, for those interested in gift giving. They arrived in a simple plastic pack."
Bali makes good Bras
I usually wear just brown or just and never gave much thought to it.  I really like the way this looks with jeans and khaki though.
"I have a really hard time finding clothes that fit because I'm fit.... and short at 5'7"". This is a thin sweater meant to be worn alone it's extremely comfortable and the color is great. I wish more clothes were made for those who are fit."
Very nice chain. I would recommend it.
nice gift on ordinary occasions . 10 day delivery time
"I had a favorite white shirt that I wore primarily as a smock. I recently stained it and soon despaired of finding another one like it, when I looked at the label to see if there was a clue as to where I might be able to find it as the Internet wasn't showing me anything even close. The label didn't give me a name, but as I'm hanging it back up I see embroidery beneath the collar that read, ""Foxcraft.""  I did a search and it was just that simple. I purchased 2 of them in different sizes; one for dress and for a smock. The fabric is soft and doesn't need ironing, but if you do iron it you'll find that it irons like a dream because it is so well made. One other thing that I really liked was the packaging. NO PINS to take out. It is held with something that just pops open with a little tug. Love it.  I should add that the price is great. I would have expected to pay $89 to $120 for this quality."
Great tap shoe for the price. Ordered our normal street size and it fits perfectly.
Good quality.  They have lasted well over a year before wearing out/ losing elasticity.  Great to wear with boat shoes.
"I bought one of these shirts in charcoal at a local surf shop this summer and love how it fits and the material seems like it will last a while.  I have found out over the past few years you pay for what you get when it comes to polo style shirts and this is one of the best ones for the money I think.  I am 6'3"" 225lbs and normally wear XL shirts so they aren't too big feeling but the surf shop only had XXL so I tried it on and it fit well so I went with it (this XXL doesn't seem as baggy when you wear it like some XXL can).  I am not drying the shirt because it fits just right so don't want to mess that up.  I wanted to get a few other colors in this style so like everything else in this world I decided to look on here and what do you know they have it and its prime (and the price was right, cheaper than some online surf shops and def cheaper than in the store).  I will probably order the green and light grey one just so I can have 4 colors for summer.  My suggestion would be go with it if you are considering one."
"Excellent bag, spacious
Only used it once so don't know about reliability"
Very cute swimsuit and if you have a little extra tummy this bathing suit works well in hiding it. The cup size was a little big but I'm a B in cup size.
"soft comfortable, I love them."
even with out ach support there very comfortable
"Accidentally ordered suntan, which is WAY dark even when I have a tan, but they've held up really well and I like them a lot."
"The fabric is thick and the seams are really well sewn. For work situations, like woodturning, I really enjoy the way the sawdust does not cling, the stains are minimal and easily removed.  The pockets are excellent  and in the right places for my tools and I can wear them with confidence that I am protected from the small things that drop or are flung out from time to time. Pluse as a 65 year old man, they are roomy enough that I have full mobility and access to the things around me easily."
it really can make a simple pair of black pants look like a night on the town.. love it
"truly beautiful and spacious, lightweight - all pieces are versatile and work well- I would recommend scotch guard if you get the lighter color.  I watched the airport handler pull it back up the conveyor because he forgot to put a tag onit and immediately caused black streaking."
"Brim is narrower than it looks in pic--makes it look a bit too small, though it's the right size to fit.  Band is kind of cheap sateen ribbon, but overall, it seems to be a good value for a very casual hat.  Not nice enough for more formal, business wear."
Not bad for the cost. Using to run in and so good so far
I buy these in all sizes. So cute!
"....a short and sweet story about this model (formally model 6309)of Seiko watch.  In February of 1978 I was in a specialized unit of the Air Force and had just arrived at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. I needed a good watch as my old Timex had just broken.  I went to the BX and bought this watch for $110.  Most expensive watch I had ever owned but I needed a good one and figured this was it.  I wore that watch on my left wrist everyday, all day for 22 and a half years! There is no embellishment here.  I sent it in every 5 years or so for a cleaning and adjustment and that's it!  How many bands did I replace?  I couldn't tell you how many bands and band pins I replaced on that watch.  It went with me everywhere through my youth to middle age.  It is truly like an old friend - the things we had done and the things we had seen - death, destruction, sea depths, high altitude, girl friends, wives, marriages, divorces, child birth, child graduation. Incredible! The day the jeweler told me it was wore-out and could no longer keep good time was the day I put it in my safety deposit box.

 ---I bought the same model watch the next day.  It has been on my wrist, ticking away, since June, 2000 -  just as faithful as my old friend who now lies resting after a long and storied career.

If you need a good watch and one that will last, I can recommend this one.

Update...12.20.15  The Seiko SKX173I bought in 2000 is still going strong after 15 1/2 years.  This watch will take me into old age.  I'm slowing down now and not nearly as active so I believe this watch may last longer than the last one.  My kids can have it when I'm gone - to do with it as they please.  They do know what these watches mean to me.

Update: 4.17.17.  Going on 17 years.  Still going strong.

There are other watches out there.  Some are digital and others are bigger and still others are more expensive. But, in my book, you can't buy a BETTER watch."
(Wife posting) I have gotten more than a few cheap looking rings in my lifetime (and paid more than this!). Need fake ones for work. This is SO BEAUTIFUL! I love the fitting for the crystal--strong and elegant. The crystal is clear and well made. I'm so happy with it after years of searching!
Just like the photo. Worn to the pool in Disneyland. It was just right.
"Been looking for denim boots for long time.
Received these  gorgeous boots today so happy they fit perfectly and the packaging is awesome they come with their own put away  bags. True to size can wear with or without socks so happy thanks Amazon one happy customer"
Fit is same as my other keen sandals.  So soft and lightweight.  Flexible.  Cool.  I'll be wearing these all summer when sandals aren't appropriate.  Careful they can be slippery
Love the shoes!! The color is just like the picture and they came in before they were suppose to so i was extremly happy!
Actually ordered 3x...thought it was my fault but two more careful attempts and you choose 3x and the machine gives your 4x.  Jockey instantly FIXED situation.  Said to give mistake to homeless shelter.  THEY ARE AWESOME!  I Paid it forward with a $50.00 additional check.  WAY TO GO JOCKEY!!  WAY TO GO AMAZON!!!  3x arrived and doing their job!
Really cute design.  My 6 year old daughter loves these pjs and won't wear anything else to bed.  They are very soft!
I always get great comments about this tie when I wear it.  Ties well to make a nice double windsor knot and gives a great dimple.  Sharp necktie!
"Very nice watch no problems with it but I've only had it for 2 days now so I'll update if anything goes wrong.
Update: the digital part of the watch became slower 1 second digitally is 1 and a half to 2 seconds longer then a normal second. Will update again if more problems accrue."
Bought to replace the buckle on my husbands belt. He loves his mission belt. Keeps his pants where they belong. Met all his expectations.
My new favorite leggings!  I'm normally a size 10-12 and they fit like a glove. They are super warm and soft inside  (not see-through). They are like wearing spanx but cheaper!
"Worked great for my daughter's Halloween Minnie Mouse costume. Fit well, no bunching. We'll be able to use it through the winter too."
Super cute and very comfortable. Fit as expected - I usually wear 8.5-9 and the 8.5 fit perfectly.
Nice garnet.  At least as far as I can tell since I'm not a jewelry expert.  My wife loves it and wears it often.  As long as she's happy that's all that matters!
These are the softest sandals I've ever worn. I may have to order in another color. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
These fit well and really saved my life teaching yoga in the hot Georgia summer.
"This was a bit shorter than I expected, had to wait for my postpartum tummy to shrink a bit before I could wear this and have it cover everything. Otherwise really comfy and easy to nurse in. Overall great purchase, I just might get a size up if I end up ordering more, which I am still considering."
"I ended p choosing a different style so this was returned but I did end up keeping a different Fossil brand wallet. So I'd buy their wallets again! Beautiful color, especially with the Gold-toned plated hardware!"
"Love this top!  Bought it in black and the sky blue and they are both great!!  I normally wear a medium top, but bought these in a small and they fit great. They are a little tight around the shoulder area when getting them on, but once on they fit perfect!"
Very comfortable. Does a great job keeping you cool.
"I really liked this dress but I returned it because the print didn't look like the picture, the green leaves were very, very dark... the fabric was very nice and soft, I loved the style! True to size."
Very nice but wish I had bought the 2.2 mm thickness to wear alone.
"They not only look great, but are easy to put on and take off when wet."
Can be worn a number of ways and looks great when teamed with other silver chains.
"Love these...shorter length, small ""gem"", not a ton of metal hanging off your nose...just a little ""something something"" to sparkle."
Great duffle for the price. Wanted something to take on a trip that wasn't as ugly as my old bag. Use every day for a gym bag too. Very versatile.
I use this when I ware my great kilt.  It is the perfect brooch for my vintage look.
"This is a really really nice looking jacket & fit true to size. I bought as a Christmas present and he received lots of compliments! This doesn't have thick insulation. It is more for the person who wants medium warmth, not too hot nor not too cold. (Kind of like picking out down comforters). The quilt stitching is done with care and not messy or cheap looking. Which is why I went with Polo because of quality. For the price of this, it is a win win & as the buyer, I am pleased!"
"These are pretty good running shoes. I have a few different pairs of running shoes. I invested in these thinking they would be the best but my cheaper Nike Free 5.0 are actually much more comfortable for running. They're not bad sneakers. But, they're not my favorite. I think it also depends on your gait when you run."
Can't be a classic Ked oxford sneaker.  Always fits the same.  Always perfect.
"beautiful, very plush !"
"These shoes are cute and pretty comfy; however, the footbed is on the hard side and I'm not sure that I would wear them on days that involve a lot of walking.  They are very cute for comfort shoes!"
"I absolutely love these Sante tops! They are extremely light-weight and perfect for warmer temps. I am most vomforyable in tops that are at least a 4X and these do not bind anywhere. I am short, 5 ft and shrt waisted as well and these hit me about 2 inches above the knee. I have this top in every color and I am always searching for other patterns in this style. I am willing to pay just about anything to get them because I live in them. For comfort, no disappointment and they are also well made."
"Great quality, runs large."
We picked up a few pairs of these trunks for a trip to Mexico. For the price they are a pretty darn good deal. The fit as expected I bouht a size larger just to make sure they weren't too small but I just sent them back. They definitely served the purpose.
"as listed , is what you get...good quality"
"This is very attractive. It is only about 1/4"" wide, yet you can read all three lines of engraving clearly.  I have donated my body to Science so I need my instructions followed quickly and completely.  This idea is the perfect solution.  The Medical ID icon will get anyone's attention.  I don't have to wonder if someone is going to look into my wallet for further information.  It's all there - spelled out for them.  The shipping time is a bit extensive, It was shipped to me on Nov. 11 and arrived today Dec. 01, whoever, they did tell me in advance it might not be here until the 14th, so they are great at estimating arrival time.

I highly recommend this bracelet."
Love this shirt.  Perfect fit.  Can wear with jeans or skirt.
"Great shoes.  They fit well - true to size, were comfortable and the first time I wore them - I walked in them for 4 hours and danced for 4 hours afterwards. No blisters, no pain, no twisting of ankle."
"These, like all of my other Propet shoes, fit perfectly and are the most comfortable shoes. I no longer buy other brands. These Oxfords, I also own in black, are perfect for work. They look great with slacks. I have turned on my co-worker friend to Propets and she has also got some of her female relatives hooked. All styles are very comfortable. I wear 8 and 1/2 Wide. Shoe heaven at last!"
love love love !!! true to the size. very comfortable  and strong. love the cloth material.
good fit and quick  delivery
They are so nice.....almost like UGG!
"Cute ring. Band is thin, however. It looks real"
"This is a great set of tie clips. For a very long time I was using the tie-tack pins, but recently started to buy some nicer ties and didn't want to ruin them. These clips are both classy, inexpensive, and varied enough where you can easily find one (usually more) that matches your outfit really well. I have regularly received compliments on them, and feel as if this is an excellent value for a good quality product.

Keep in mind though that I typically purchase traditional width ties. If you buy ties that are extra wide, I don't know if these would be quite as good looking anymore. Just keep that in mind when buying. Other than that, I fully recommend these to anyone!"
"Good socks, I would buy again."
Very nice scarf. Helps keep moisture in my natural hair.
"The size is good and the quality seems pretty good. It's not a real heavy t-shirt, but that's okay. Bought one for me and one for my husband so we can be ""Creeper Keepers"" with our six year old in a Creeper costume we made. So it'll be cute for Halloween."
"My shoe size is 5.5 but I sometimes get a half size up due to my wide feet. For this pair of boots, though, the size 5.5 fit just fine with regular socks. They are very warm and work great for running errands, etc in a fair amount of snow. I also appreciate how easy it is to slip them on and off since I'm constantly running after three little ones. Overall, very happy with the purchase."
"If my diamond eternity band wasn't stamped I wouldn't be able to tell them apart.  This is understated and beautiful, very very sparkly."
The outfit is pretty. I am happy with the purchase.
"I was so pleased with the first pair I ordered, that I reordered in two additional colors. Nice product, delivered super-fast!"
"Cariloha are my new socks.  For my sweaty feet, these do the job of allowing my feet to breathe.  My now only brand since they are affordable. Any Cariloha socks are great.

Cariloha if you're reading, I like free products to spread my brand loyalty around town. "
Runs a little large but is so cute. Im thinking about getting other colors. Can be casual or dressed up.
Nice and comfortable :)
"Nice and warm, but not too much.  I have some 100 gram LLB hikers ($100) that are warmer."
"A little context before I begin the review of THESE pants...

I searched for weeks for a good brand of work pants and the list of choices was a bit overwhelming. After much reading I was ready to try the pants on, if I could find them locally. I tried on Dickies, Wranglers, Carhartts, Craftsmans, Outdoor Life, etc. I was extremely disappointed in all of them. Regular fit, slim fit, straight fit, it didn't matter. They all felt strange for one reason or another. Too tight, too stiff, too thick, too thin, too many pockets, not enough pockets, pockets too small, pockets too big, pockets in weird positions, etc.

Then I came across these at Sears. There was only one pair in my size and due to the abuse by customers and employees so the pants had a tiny hole near the knee. It didn't matter to me because right when I touched these pants, they felt comfortable in my hands. I instantly knew they would be comfortable wearing them as work pants. I was right. I tried them on. The label said that they were traditional fit--they sit at the waist so I'm not going to show my crack to anyone standing behind me. There was enough room in the legs and throughout the pants for me to be able to move without being too baggy. Did I mention how comfortable they felt? The leg openings were large enough to fit over my boots without qualifying as disco pants. Pockets galore. The only knock knock would be they the side pockets sit lower than what I would have preferred because wearing kneepads restricts access to the right pockets. And about the comfort. Anyway, like I said, I found these pants at Sears so I bought them right then and there.

I liked them so much I went to another Sears but they didn't have my size so I came to Amazon and found them here for a great price. Not as cheap as Sears with their 50% discount but well worth the money spent."
"I know my size and I hate shopping.  So far, I've bought five pair of these from Amazon and I don't have to leave the house to do it.  I typically get a few years out of a pair before they're due for reassignment to lesser activities, but I only throw them away after they no longer keep my man parts out of the weather.  If these last as long as they have in the past, my next purchase will be stretch pants for a trip to the early bird buffet."
"I Ike the size of this very reasonably priced bag. Big enough for several thick  folders, a wallet, big glasses case, wallet, Ipad, phone. The odor mentioned by some reviewed is there but not extreme, although if I left this bag on my car for a few hours on a hot summer day when I first got it, I might have a different view. I think the smell has faded enough that it won't be an issue. Good value for the price."
Our wedding bands will not be there in enough time so I got this as a fill-in. I was surprised how nice it was and when shown to a friend she loved it too. It's a good value if you don't want to spend a fortune on a wedding band.
These are nice tennis shoes and the cost was also good!
I have tried numerous lacing systems and these are by far the best I have tried.  Clear cut instructions and videos on the website make installation a breeze.  You won't be disappointed!
"Color was a bit darker than the photo, although that's a good thing - too light and any stains/marks would show far too easily. Fits well and looks great for sping/summer weddings and events."
"I ordered and returned about half a dozen boots over the past year.  As much as I really wanted a cute pair of boots, I was more concerned with comfort.  I can wear these anywhere and while they aren't the sexiest boot out there, the comfort makes up for it.  I have a wide foot and calf and these fit fine."
I wear them all the time.  Their my everyday earrings and they look great with everything.  I like the size.  Not too small or too big. Perfect.
The fit was pretty great. I am a short girl however so it was a bit long in the torso.
This is a beautiful necklace and bracelet set.  I purchased this for my daughter's 7th birthday.  It is cute and classy; not overdone or cheap looking.  She is wearing it now!
Was a good fit. Nice soft material. Washed well..no huge shrinkage if any.
"These sweats are very soft and comfortable. They seemed to run a little small but all in all I am very comfortable in them. I have noticed some pilling already which is unfortunate, but they are so soft and such a good weight for Northern California Springtime that I am still very happy with them"
"love it.  I possibly wear it too much.  Liked it so much I have bought couple more in other colors.  Try it, you'll probably like it too!"
"I have worn them for about four hours, but have not yet had them in the water. unable to make a full eval yet."
"I purchase the white leather pair in a size 11W they run small. Shoe are very nice looking, however the first strap is to tight and second one is to loose. Would have been better fit with adjustable straps"
Great bracelet. Slow shipping.
"These are not heavy duty sandals. These are sandals that will not last if worn consistently, but they are extremely comfortable and great to use around the house. I have tile floor and hate to walk around with bare feet. I've been purchasing these types of sandals for many years and do find these specific ones have lasted longer than expected."
These were beautiful but one of the stones was missing so I had to send back & I am waiting on the replacement pair
Durable beautiful ring.
"You can never go wrong with these classic shoes! My husband has been wearing them for years and every year we buy him a new pair since he wears them so much throughout the year.
Always well made and a classic look. Can't ask for much more!"
Glasses fit and went perfect with his rappers costume.
"Really comfy and cute top, however had to perform some sewing magic on it as the front ruffle was longer than the back and really not flattering (and I am fairly tall!).  After that, now I love it!!"
warm and comfy as well as cute. perfect for winter in ohio.
It is beautiful. I wear it a lot.
"I have several pairs of Timberland boots and love them all. This pair is no exception. Great quality. Sturdy and durable. Cute and versatile. The only difference that sticks out is that it isn't as comfortable as my other pairs. It's kind of stiff all around (including the foot bed), but perhaps that'll change with more use. It's not a huge issue though - I can still wear these throughout a work day without any problems.

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in."
"Love it, can't wait for the warm weather......"
"These Duduma Premium full mirrored sunglasses are just what I expected... basic and inexpensive!

The size of the frames are reasonable, but if you have a larger head they might be snug. I have an average sized head and they fit great! They are definitly not for anyone with a big head. The tint Is completely mirrored. I purchased the red/gold pair and I must admit for the price they are a great pair of stylish and functional sunglasses. They do not compare to Ray Bans ofcourse but in my opinion spending a fortune on named brand glasses such as these with the tint isn't justifiable because they aren't everyday glasses for me. Price point is great for the quality of these glasses. Highly reccomend if you are in the market.

* I recieved this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
this was for my daughter who loved it .....it fits perfectly and very trendy........will definitely buy from them again.....and the style is so flattering
"This is an awesome dress! Will buy in more colors! I followed the reviews for sizing, 5'3 143 lbs with a bigger bottom....got a medium and it fits great! I got white and obviously it is gonna be see through a bit."
"Love this tee, husband even complimented it.  Nice and long the way I like them."
"Great fitting shirt that so far seems to be perfect for the price. Been through the wash a handful of times and no complaints, can't go wrong from our perspective!"
"I bought these Red Garnet earrings for a friend. Red is her favorite color. These are beautiful, and the pair I was sent are very red. Just the right size to wear every day if you wish. I would recommend them to anyone that likes red and good quality."
Cloth feels very comfortable to wear but not great quality can be easily torn!
"My poor luggage is so dirty now.
My other London held up better. I will try to clean it up. I will keep you posted."
"It's a leather wallet that looks and feels legit. It's woven with fabric that blocks out bad guys. Pretty much it's the best wallet I've owned. It holds all my cards, cash, and even has hidden pockets for my movie theater ticket collection. Not bulky at all and I've gotten several compliments from other men and women.  Let's just say you'll be the talk of the town with this piece. Do me a favor and purchase this bad boy; you won't regret it."
"A beautiful pair of earrings! The perfect earrings to go from day to night, as dressy or casual as you need. Because the ""pearl"" separates the two hoops, they take up more visual space and appear larger than they are. Unlike many pieces of costume jewelry earrings I've purchased lately, the stem is NOT fragile and will not bend at the least resistance. The stem fits into the stop perfectly, and remains in place throughout the day. The earrings are a beautiful shiny yellow gold and do not look ""cheap"". Overall I'm very pleased and would purchase these for a gift."
"The service provided by this seller was solid ... but I was somewhat disappointed in the overall quality of this thermal undershirt. In comparison to others I own, this one is a  bit ""flimsy"" and not as ""thick"" !  Next time I order a thermal undershirt, I will seek a different brand, not necessarily a different seller."
Bought it for a trip. I'm looking forward to wearing it!
So many compliments from this. Sparkly and pretty
"This is a very attractive men's watch, with a unique and stylish watch face.  The date function looks fantastic.  It fits comfortably on my wrist, and features a really nice band.  My only reason for giving this a four star rating instead of five stars is the fact that the watch face is just a little too large for my taste.  While that is in-style today, I think it makes it less likely for this to remain a classic looking time piece."
Comfy and great for rainy days
It was as the pictures showes. Most reviews with the photos were on spot. I used it couple of times and still looks brand new.
"Very nice, easy to read, goes with anything, wonderful watch for the price."
the material is very stretchy and much like tights but they are great
Verycomfortable
"LOVE!!!  The quality of the materials are very nice and for the price, you can't beat it"
was light and I love it!
My little guy LOVES his robe and slippers!!! He's a very slender but tall guy and not quite 2 yet but this is roomy for him to grow into
"Comfy and gorgeous - unusual style! Great quality.  I'm a size 8, and got size 39. They are a perfect fit! There's a pleasant surprise too, that nobody mentions.... The straps are adjustable for your ankle size! I'm getting others in different colors!"
"I wore this under part of a Gamora - Guardians of the galaxy costume - did not wear the face part and just tucked it into the body suit.  It was great for what I needed - I had the adult M and am a female 5'2"" and wear a size 12."
"Good quality just as pictured
Husband is a huge fan loves it."
"It is very well made, good leather, I have not used it yet"
I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them!  They feel like walking on clouds and can be worn with a suit or for casual wear.
I bought this watch for my husband for Fathers Day he loves it! It was a little big we had to take a few links . But over all it looks great!!!
Love these but as always order Propet shoes seem a 1/2 size too small. I were a 7 in every shoe I own except Propet. Order a 1/2 size larger.
Love my pinky n the brain shirt
"Slightly large, but the wife is a Filipina who is only 5'1"" so might fit others naturally."
Fits true to size. Not a bad break in period. I've been a Birkenstock gal for 20 years.  I'm going to like these better then the Birks! I'm hoping they will last longer since they aren't cork!
Love them. Good size for my small lobes.
Love it! First well.
"My daughters call these my ""princess shoes""!  They are comfortable, pretty, and stylish."
"My arches are very high, and in the summertime my Fitflops conform to my feet like a firm version of memory foam, helping alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis. I've been wearing cheap slippers for too long & my feet hurt, so I shelled out to get some REALLY GOOD slippers like these.

They're a little tight in the toes, and take a while to break in, but I really do love them. I suppose if I spent more time standing up, they'd break in faster! At first they felt very hard and cold but after a few hours I was reluctant to take them off. After wearing them for about 6 weeks now, they're starting to conform to my feet and feel good. Even though the backs are open, they are quite warm and cozy.

The bottoms are extremely thick and waterproof, so I have no problem going outside in a little bit of snow or rain to get my dog if I need to. That was a must, for me!

They're taking longer to break in than I expected, but I do love them so. I feel like the long break-in period means they will not fall apart easily and I can wear them for many winters to come. They are VERY good quality, solid, warm, and well-constructed. Much pinker than in the photo! Pretty close to Barbie Pink, which is a bonus for me but may not be for you!"
mocassin girl loves em
"Wonderful pantie.  Fit great.  Lays flat under clothing.  Comfortable waistband.  I love this product. Its great that I can sit in front of my fireplace, drink my capacinno and be able to order online"
Good shoe! Still miss the ol gt 2160 though.
"I find this bathrobe to be exactly what I was looking for. It is not a very thick material, nor is it very thin. It's very absorbent and works perfectly for me. I did not find it to be scratchy or in any way unusable before washing. I think it's a great bathrobe and works like a great big towel to dry me off when I get out of the shower. Just as a bathrobe, it is nice and warm to sit around in. I'm considering getting another, in a different color."
Really like it but somehow keep falling down
The fit is snug and the material is sturdy
"Handsome Keyring!
I purchased the NAVY BLUE.
This is a unisex keyring.
Came perfectly packaged from seller.
Wish the leather used was STRONGER Leather but regardless, this is a great piece."
These were for my nephew and he loved them...they are so cute
"I don't usually like to buy clothes online because I always want to try things on first. I have a shapely build and I thought a wrap-style dress would be safe. This dress is made of soft, stretchy material and it is very comfy. I think I underestimated a little bit because it's just a little more snug than I would like. My recommendation is to go a little larger (because it stretches), if you don't want it to cling. Otherwise, it is a great purchase."
Wish the black didn't fade so fast.
I love those shoes for their light weight and great flexibility.
"A little bit bulkier and therefore not quite as good as my original GI field watch, but almost exactly the same and very acceptable as a civilian wannabe model.  Actually, the tritium dial is so bright that if I was using this watch in the field I would be concerned that the brightness of the dial might give away my pos by being seen on an enemy NV device."
Absolutely love it! Only down side is that the fabric is very thin and slightly see through
"Montrail has a winning combo with this shoe. Have trained for 4 years in these shoes and average about 1800 miles/year in training.
Have raced many ultras and finished Leadville 100 in these shoes.
Have owned 10 pairs of these and they never disappoint on the trail.
The shoes are grippy on rocks and smooth enough for road running when necessary.
I am average build 160 lb and not a believer in the minimalist running.
I do appreciate and believe in the zero drop."
Beautiful. It looks just as it does in the picture and comes in a nice box.
Great gag gift for right before the holiday lol
This quality tie was just what my daughter was looking for to go with her ring master tuxedo for a Vintage Circus prom theme! Love it!!!
Good fitting belt
"Shoes are great. Very comfortable in short term. After about 5 hours of constant walking, the foam falls flat and I have very little padding. They are good by the next morning, so I can wear them again."
Love this cape.  It is so cute!  Fabric is soft and the plaid is very pretty.  Love it.
"They are REEF so of course they are comfortable and durable but these ones look less ""beachy"" and a bit more for dressing for dinner. While on vacation recently I used these, or a second pair I have in silver, for going to dinner with the family and for walking the town. They look great."
"I love them, I wear a size 12 shoe, and the ones you buy that are for size shoe 6-12 are just too tight, these fit great, are nice and soft."
"Material is good
Fits right"
like the fit.
"Love this top! It is very flattering and looks great on, but wrinkles easily and shrinks significantly."
"great value for the price. haven't tried wearing them all day, but I don't wear heels much anyway. I have worn them dancing all night, though, with no problem"
great buy. WORTH THE COST.
"I am 5 foot 3 and 158 pounds, size 13 fits perfectly with zero muffin Toppin as you can see in the pic with my shirt hiked up (sorry about showing the stretch marks - 4 kids were in there ') The material is slightly stretchy so I could have probably went a size down, but I like this one a lot.  My man loves this skirt."
My shoes just came today and they look amazing! I went a half size bigger and they fit like a dream. They don't smash my toes together like some platform boots do. I totally love these.
I love that this is a boy shirt for Peppa Pig! My son wore it for his second birthday and it fit him as expected and he loved it!
These glasses are perfect for all ages.
very comfortable and roomy just like I like it to be.
"This duffle bag got me through my 5 week road trip through the USA.
Very solid and not cheaply made. I had a set of clothes each day for 6 days in my car and took 2 sets into my small suitcase that I took up to the hotel room. Then every morning I put my dirty set into the duffle bag. Once I ran out of clothes I looked for a laundry in either the hotel or somewhere outside. This worked perfectly for my 5 weeks on the road. The duffle bag was easy to carry and the clothes fit perfectly. This is how I will do this on future trips. This bag will last for a long time. I even threw it into the washer and it came out like new."
"Bra is more flattering than in the photo. Good support and well made as expected from Bali. I purchased this bra to lounge around the house, and it is perfect for that.  Minus 1 star for being a bit small. I laid it out and lined it up and compared with my other bras, and it is fully 2"" shorter (from end to end between closures), also there are 4 rows of eyes and hooks which for me are too many for such a light bra. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase, because this type of bra seems hard to find."
Love this slippers...plus they are memory foamish and oh so comfy!!
"Despite the lightness of the fabric, this is a year-round item for me. Looks great in the summer over a plain black tank dress and will look equally great with a sweater dress (or sweater and black pants) in the fall and winter. Drapes beautifully."
"So far, these are great! Very comfortable. I hope they hold up too washings! So far, so good."
Love my Olivia and Joy bag.  I get a ton of compliments and can't beat the price!
"LOVEEEE this dress! I bought the heels through amazon as well. It fits so perfect on me and it was actually pretty long so i got it hemme to fit my my height which is 4""11 and a half so it might fit great all around for someone taller but i love this dress and might order in another color, great silky material! "
"Fit great. I usually wear sz 10 in pants/bottoms & 38C bust, bought the sz 14 in this suit based on reviews. Unfortunately, this was one of 2 tops that I forgot at home because I hung them in a different spot to dry so I can't say how well it holds everything in for wearing all day."
"Love these earrings.  I have very sensitive ears and haven't had any problems.  I've been wearing them 24/7 since mother's day.  They are comfortable and cute.  I've received many compliments on them.  I went with the narrow, and they are as thin as lead refill for mechanical pencils."
I have about six pairs of Seibel shoes and liked the look of these boots. Pair I received said extra wide but were actually more narrow than wide. As a reference the Seibel Walt shoes I find to be fairly wide even though they are not described as such but these boots were much narrower than  the Walt so we're uncomfortable for me. Maybe the last of this boot is slightly  narrower in the toe. Nice leather and wife liked them too. Slightly furry lining would be good in colder weather.
worked as expected.  Using these on a trampoline to keep out miscreants.  We'll see how it holds up to weather over time...
Great pants and great fit. Ordered one in each color
"I'm a HUGE music lover & I bought this for myself. I really love it! The silver is real - it never tarnishes. The pendant is a little on the large size, but still quite lovely! "
"I liked this costume. I bought it for my 15 year old (very petite) daughter. She looked great! We did have to pin up the shoulder straps a bit because they were much too long. But, better too long than too short.  A couple of safety pins and she was good to go. We got a lot of compliments on this costume."
"Love these pants. After reading the reviews I was apprehensive. I tried them on immediately and they fit perfect. I'm 5'2"" and 105 pounds I ordered the small. Love these!"
"Love this pattern, wear most days since it matches almost everything.

Fit is good."
perfect size and awesome price
I bought these as a gift for my sister. She loves them!
"Love these. The color gradation is so nice, and the shape frames my face nicely and stays put without pinching or leaving marks on the bridge of my nose. Oversized without being silly, they look fun and classy.

The sun protection is good-- they're dark and not color-tinted.

They come with a protective bag.

I received these for review."
I really like the beads on this necklace.  The length is just right and the necklace is very lightweight.  Fun for any occasion!
This is my second pair of spalding activewear pants. I really like these capris and find the flare fit to be very flattering.
"This fits me really well and does a great job of lifting and enhancing my cleavage.  Good shape, doesn't bunch up under shirts."
"This neck warmer arrived just in time.

Seven degrees, -12 windchill, and snow blowing the driveway!

It's medium weight microfleece and it works.

There was no snow on my neck to melt and freeze. My neck.....Stayed warm.

Is it good quality? I couldn't even find a thread to trim.

Will it stay in place? The adjustable, elastic cord holds firmly.

What's the catch? Just that you'll have to wait until it arrives to wear it.

Complete coverage is key to staying warm and this covers an area that sometimes isn't, and needs to be.

I recommend spraying it with a water repellent so that it can't absorb moisture. With your body heat and snow, it could become damp and be less effective. If you will not be around snow or any precipitation, don't worry about it, I spray everything I wear because I often am. I also have neoprene gear, but that's not as comfy as this.

Just pull it over your head, tighten it around your chin and if you get too hot, pull it down and pull it back up when you want to.

It's a great item if you aren't in the south during the winter, where I should be in -12 degree weather.

Thanks for sending this for me to review guys! I really needed it."
"very low quality, worth the price anyway."
These are just what I wanted. They are lightweight and very roomy. I wear them for exercise and walking.
Love it!  Very comfortable. Will be  buying more!
"These boots are my go to boots for playing in the snow with my 4 year old daughter. My feet stay dry and warm, they run a bit small compared to other boots of the Kamik styles. So keep that in mind. But price well, shipping great, and they are warm and comfortable. If you run errands with these, you will still get compliments on your cute boots :)"
This hands free breastpump bra was a life-saver for me.  I returned to my desk job after 8 weeks of maternity leave and having this bra allowed me to still do my job while I pumped at the same time.  Great quality and loved that it was adjustable.
"I Looooooooove these boots!  I've had them for a few years and they are beginning to show their age.
So sad that Naturalizer no longer makes them!  PLEASE start making these boots again!
What is so great? 1. They are real leather, which is buttery soft and looks fabulous. 2. The heel height is PERFECT for all day/evening wear, not too high, but still kinda sexy. 3. The tie up embellishment in the back is subtle yet eye catching at the same time (also kinda sexy)
4. They are super comfortable! PLEASE MAKE THESE BOOTS AGAIN!!!!!!"
These make the best gifts for girlfriends.  Sooo cute I used them as part of my Spring into Summer fun girl's weekend little gifts.
"Such a cute watch for the price! Arrived fast. This is actually a fairly heavy, decent little watch for this price. I was surprised! Looking at it, I would guess it to be in the 30 dollar price range purchased from a store. Very happy with it!"
Good quality but the size is slightly larger than expected
Great looking hat and it fits perfectly. Now I need a jacket to match it. Im looking for that now.
"I purchased these for my young niece who has small fingers.  Her regular ring size is 4 and these worked very well for her.  She was very pleased, therefore, so am I."
"Haven't put it on her bracelet, but I bought it for my sister. She'll love it."
Husband is happy with it and he has a very large head
Nice long chain bright colors
I love Carters clothes and the leggings are so pretty and good quality! I recommend it for sure. My granddaughter uses Carters everyday.
excellent for my father
Cute hoops & I love all the different sizes. You could easily dress these up or down. I also like that they are flexible so I don't feel that I have to be cautious with them. Do not weigh my ears down either.
This is the second one I purchased for my husband.  So cute and real looking.  Every one likes them.
It looked great with the shirt and suspenders
This was perfect with the rest of the costume.
These boots are literally one of the coolest pairs I own.  I can wear them all day/night without any pain at all.  Very comfortable and bad @ss.  The color is a dark grey and beautiful.  You can wear them with anything from skinnies to skirts to leggings.  They're hot!
"Have one in every color, my twelve year old sleeps in his coyote brown one. This vendor is fast to ship, delivery faster than expected. Hat fits perfect and is very warm even when damp"
"These poem style shoes that Clarks makes are very nice. They are good quality, comfortable and nice looking. I ordered this one and a couple of others that also had ""poem"" in the name. All have nice cusion insoles. I took the shoes to my foot dr who agreed that they were good shoes with good support, the inner soles looked as good as some expensive ones they sell at the dr office. I would recommend these shoes. I can walk all day in these shoes and not have sore feet. I ordered a wide width and the fit was good. The shoes are roomy, and still look trim and smart. I wish Clarks would make more and in more colors, I would buy them again."
This owl watch is really cute. It works well and it's stylish! Great buy especially for people who can't wear watches.
"I've purchased several of these bras.  Apparently, my shoulders slope just the right way that many bras will slip right off my shoulders, but I've never had that problem with these.  They're comfortable to wear."
"Great product: Great color selection , Fit, Style,  Comfort, they have it all. You can not go wrong with these Clarks!"
"Fit very well.  Comfortable without special slips or bras.  I am not much of a dress-up person, because I find those clothes uncomfortable.  Love that it is washable.  I am 5'8"", 190lbs and ordered a sz 16."
Our niece was very happy with these jeans
"A little thinner than expected, but fit perfectly!"
"Beautiful, bright color. Warm, snuggly and is perfect for any occasion, anywhere.  Love it."
Very pretty ring. Exactly what I was looking for!
"It is nice, comfortable fabric. It fits as expected."
perfect fit. I love amazon
"Gift for sisters graduation from police academy. She loved it. Quality far exceeds the price expectancy. No clasp though, over the head only and the chain is a bit long"
Super comfy!! Will always buy this brand .Good for people with flat feet like myself!
I'm 5'2. I bought 10 short. Fits Great! Not too tight in the legs and hugs tummy in.
Amazing dress!  I love it - very comfortable and flattering.
Wallet is smaller than I expected. I'll keep it and see if I can cut back on items I carry.
I've worn Merrell shoes for years and these fit as expected - maybe slightly loser in the toebox than the Siren model. Otherwise I ordered my size and was not disappointed.
"OK.... the fit and feel was nice (my husband just slipped them on once, so there's that) but he did return them because of the color. His fault for not looking closely. ;)"
Good price. Last forever.
"so I haven't put it through it's paces yet. It's pretty, but I'm disappointed to find that the flower part is some sort of plastic. Luckily, I planned on hanging it from it's integral loop, from the outside of my purse. Hopefully it will stay there till I need it. It took several minutes to figure out how to open it, since there are no instructions and I didn't want to use so much strength that I might break something that wasn't supposed to be movable. I have had something similar to this before, that got lost... I think it was manufactured to a higher ""refinement"" of the mechanical parts, than this one. Still, this one costs less than the purse hook I bought 9 years ago!"
This belt is a must have for those who care to shape up their  bodies. I am super pleased with it
"I got the medium for my son. It fits perfectly except for the head, which is too small. If your kid has an oversized head, too--as in, wears teenager hats--it won't fit over it, i.e. it doesn't stretch much. Other than that, it's perfect. We'll be using face paint."
"It was a gift for my daughter. We loved the feel of the fabric, the print, color, and versatility! She loved it!"
Sized down a full size from Brannock and it fits perfectly. Love this colour as well. Cant wait until Spring to start wearing them.
"These gloves are incredibly soft. They're thick and have a warm and very soft liner inside. My children love these. They aren't water proof, but for every day wear they're amazing. Warm, easy to put on themselves and not too bulky. Just what we need!"
"I got these at a great price.  And with that said, great value.  These are not heavy weight jeans, but seem sturdy enough for handyman work. The best feature for me is the slash front pockets - easy to get  tools or whatever in and out."
Great boot and excellent color :)
Great for under the little one's clothes.
Looks just like picture made of good material. Extremely reasonable price for a children's hat
Comfy. I live in it.
"I was very impressed by how sparkly these are. I like these more than cubic zirconia, they sparkle more clear and white. They could be a little bigger though."
"cute and wonderful product, came to my home with no problems. I would recommend it to my friends and family."
"I ordered these shoes bc i needed a pair of red shoes to wear i didn't own a red pair of any style shoes, they looked good on line but when i got them home they were stunning and the color was spot and the fit was perfect, love these shoes cant go wrong ordering these ladies they r stunning!!!!!"
Great fit. Comfortable but warm.
"Amston Timbs have been my go-to, last all day, comfort boot for a while now. I have them in multiple colors. The classic Wheat never disappoints. Thank you!"
"Such a hit with our friends, fit my boyfriend as expected"
Most comfortable shoes in the world according to my husband!
"This is a shiny, high-quality sterling silver chain, and I couldn't be happier with it. I first ordered the 8mm/22"" version, but after trying it on, decided to return it for the slightly less-ostentatious 6.5mm/20"". 'Works for me. Plus, I'm pleased with The Bling Factory's customer service."
Good shoes very comfortable and also stylish
"Great accessory to go with the KONOV Jewelry Mens Stainless Steel Ring, 8mm and  INBLUE Men's Stainless Steel Rubber Bracelet Link"
I got it well
i love it nice watch.
"I wear between a size 2-4 in dresses.  I bought this in a large wanting it to be loose.  It fits.  It's not tight at all, but if I had gone with a smaller size I'm sure the buttons on the chest would pull.  Sizing aside, it's a nice sweater for the price.  The pearly buttons are a nice touch"
"This is a beautiful and impressive looking watch. It is easy to set the time and date, and easy to use the extended stop watch style function. Even more impressively, the manufacturer thoughtfully provides a link tool so that you can adjust the band without resorting to paying a jeweler. They even emailed a new version of the product manual upon receipt of my order, feeling that the enclosed manual needed an update.

The face is large and easy to read, and the platinum color of the band and the watch case is pleasant.

Recommended.

I received a sample of this watch for evaluation and review."
Was too large so I returned it hopefully for a womens size 6.
I'm a size 12 - 12.5 and have purchased several different shoe horns over the year but these are great.
It's really cute.  Just like the description.  My granddaughter It's going to love it.
Seen these at Target sold with a green hat to represent bottle cap I guess.  Did not believe my grandson would like the hat so was please to find these.  Quality seems very good.  He will not get it till Christmas.
"I purchased this petticoat based on the measurements and sizing provided in the item description, and found that for me it did fit true to size. It's a great crinoline overall. A little long for me (5'4"") but that's easily solved by wearing it a little higher on my waist. The lining isn't the greatest and it can get a little itchy at times. I wouldn't plan to wear it very long without nylons, tights, biking shorts, etc on underneath. I bought the navy color and found that it was a true navy blue in person, unlike the brighter blue it appeared on my screen. The fabric is good quality and the construction is great. I expect that this crinoline will hold up well to what I'll be using it for. If you're looking for a true super floofy look, you'll probably need 2 of these. I would guess in the picture, they are doubled up as it doesn't look quite that thick in person - but if you just want a little lift and shape to your skirt and not the full ballgown look, this will do the job nicely!

I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own and did not affect the purchase price."
I will buy it again.
Nice lightweight raincoat. Comfortable and cool especially since I live in Florida and during rain season it is humid and pours.
This bracelet is just beautiful. I count on it looking elegant and classy otherwise I wouldn't wear it nor would I go as far as leaving a review.  I have paid over $100.00 for a bracelet from JTV and it wasn't as pretty as this one.  If the clasp doesn't fit just right I would tell you to tweak it because you sure wouldn't want to lose it.
Quality Chinese  workmanship
"This is a very pretty necklace. Colors are clear and vibrant and I like that it is adjustable for length. Very unusual piece and looks great with my new sun dress. Didnt need to contact customer service but they did email me to make sure everything was satisfactory, which it was. Im very happy with purchase"
"Exactly what I needed for outdoor runs in winter. I don't always use the ponytail hole, but it's convenient if I need to."
"Shirt was as advertised, as expected, good quality.  Has held up well after multiple washings.  Fits as it should.  Very satisfied!"
beautiful and it came very quickly
Exactly what I was looking for!! Love them!
Our grandsons new favorite!
Comfortable and well made. I really like these for everyday use.
Gildan makes great sweatshirts...they are a little long...but otherwise good!
What a fantastic price for a high quality pair of boots.  They fit perfect and are modern and stylish.  There aren't a lot of reviews for this item and I decided to try it out anyway since they are so affordable.  As soon as I saw the detail and workmanship that went into these I was excited.  They look and feel as nice as a pair from Fred Meyer's (Kroger in some states) that would cost $80-$100 and are way better than the affordable boots that I have purchased from many stores in the mall. A lot of those don't come in half sizes like these did.  They came in a a boot box with shoe stuffing in them so they could be easily wrapped and given as a gift.  The heels are just the right length and are thick and well made and the zippers are good quality and easy to zip.  The material used is sturdy and thick too and the buckles look great.  I have six other pairs of boots and some are designer boots that are flimsy compared to these.  I will definitely order more boots from this seller and would strongly recommend this pair of boots. Please see my photos for an example. Thanks!
"Great little bag for the gym. I can fit my running shoes (Women's size 10) in the bottom and a pair of shorts or yoga pants, sports bra, tshirt and socks! All with room for my GPS watch and deodorant! Exactly what I wanted! Might be a bit snug if you wear thick or bulky gym clothes or need a sweater but it has been great for the summer! My only complaint is that it does not have a shoulder strap but I can sew one on pretty easily!"
I love the look and the cut but I am confused about the zipper on the side.  It does not help a body to get into or out of it.  Just for looks perhaps?  Once the dress is on it is very flattering! Well made -zipper placement not considered.
"Fabric is soft on our kiddo's skin - no irritation or seam/elastic marks.  Colors and fabric have held up well to washes and wear.  No fading, tears, or thin spots.  Super comfy jammies."
Would recommend to any man that works out on the field. This hat protects you from harsh sun exposure not allowing your face or neck to sunburn.
Love these T-Shirts
"My favorite features about these Levis are the comfort, look, fit, and slant trouser pockets.

Casual Friday is everyday with these pants. Dress them up with some Clark's suede or leather Bushacre casual boots."
"This dress is beautiful! Very happy with it, nice material & well made! I did need to sew the shoulder straps a little shorter for a more snug fit, but that's fairly easy & everyone is built a bit different so I wouldn't consider that a flaw. Truly very happy with this, & my daughter is in heaven wearing it to her Knight for a princess dance."
He's wearing them so I guess he thinks they're fine.  Thank you.
"I like these shoes. After hit and miss of shoes on Amazon, these don't pinch in anywhere unexpected, the leather is durable, the color in the pictures is accurate. Make sure to get a good insole and they will be almost as comfortable as tennis shoes."
"Great quality top. Not see through. Material is comfy, has stretch to it and it not too thin. I usually wear a small or extra small top."
"I am in love with these leggings. Initially I got one in burgundy and I liked them, so I ordered two more of them -coral and aqua.  They fit well and they are super soft  and comfortable to wear. These are not made up of cotton, but I am okay with it. I can't find the regular colors I want in departmental stores, hence I got them from here. I usually do not give a 5 star but trust me these are real good."
These are awesome shoes exactly like they say.  Very comfortable and well made.
Very nice and comfortable. light weight
"When you pick this up, you KNOW right away that there is no metal in it.

But when you put it on, it doesn't drag your neck down either. I got this for my girlfriend, who doesn't normally wear jewelry, and she likes it. It does change colors with body temperature, and matches just about everything.

I'd buy it again. I'd pay $10 more if they would just make it out of stainless steel so that it will last longer."
"I love them!!  They are dress-up sandals - not all day sandals, so I do not need the great arch support I would want in daily sandals.  They looked great wearing them to a casual wedding with white silk slacks - everyone commented on them and asked where I got them.  I actually wore them for six hours and they were fine."
Nothing says happy holidays like having a band of moose humping across your tee shirt. This review is in response to the company hounding me for it. They couldn't afford the time to add a name to the form letter e mail so it came addressed to Jane Doe. I gave the item 5 stars because it is funny and my brother loved it as a gift.
Wow! Comfortable would recommend
"Very cute, but (larger than I thought) purse. It fits ipads in the side compartment effortlessly. The pink is also very subtle. Not too abrasive. I bought a rose gold keychain and attached it to the purse to add some sparkle."
Great boots and warm and waterproof!
"Love these boots!  I always, always, always order boots/shoes 1/2 size larger when I order over the internet so I ordered these accordingly (an 8-1/2 instead of an 8).  My thinking is if they are 1/2 size too large I can live with that but 1/2 size too small, no can do.  I could definitely have taken these in my normal size (8) but I am happy enough with these in an 8-1/2. They don't flip flop in the back...just more toe room. I have a medium size width foot and these are borderline wide width (definitely not for narrow width person though-they will be too wide).

I like that they don't have a pointy, pointy toe like most cowboy boots.  They have a rounded point if you know what I mean but pointy enough to look like authentic cowboy boots.  The heal height is also perfect for me.  I can't wear high heals anymore so 2-1/2"" is ideal for me.

I ordered them in the gray since I have black boots and brown boots and am very happy with the color.  They are a smoky gray, unlike the picture which makes them look more brownish.

I got these for  30 bucks and can't believe it.  They are comfortable and cute.  I am really happy with this purchase."
I am enjoying the slippers and they are as represented.
I always get the same bra
Fitted just right!
This is a VERY sturdy belt. The buckle is nice but not flashy. I definitely would say this is the best jeans belt I've seen in a while. Don't let the price fool you. It's way more belt than it's selling for.
"Bought 5 of these in various colours, at less than $6 each, why not. I prefer adjustable caps because, umm, you can adjust them! They seem to be made well enough, nice light cotton so great when the weather warms up a little. Very comfortable indeed and I'm sure I'll be buying some more from this seller."
"I read these run a little big so I ordered accordingly. I bought the black and the beige, and the black fits very nicely. (I found that the beige runs a bit smaller, maybe 1/2 size smaller than the black. I don't know if this is a quality control issue, or if these were made in different factories.) The black is definitely my favorite. It's drapes beautifully and is long enough to wear comfortably and modestly with leggings."
"Bought these shoes for my son for our Arizona/Grand Canyon trip. He liked them a lot. Plenty of support and traction which allowed him to trek through caves, up rocks, and easily traverse the trails. We bought Merrells for everyone in the family, Grassbow Air for the wife and All Out Blaze for me, and were pleased with each pair. Highly recommend the Merrells."
"Love this watch. Perfect for hospital work. Easy to see, reliable, and comfortable. Only thing is, my wrist is a little small so the strap end kind of sticks out when it's on."
My all time favorite sweater
"comfortable, full coverage, I buy these for the fabric covered elastic ."
"Yes, it's made in China.  Sigh.  Still, it fits true to size, nice color (just as shown), stitching looks good. Arrived quickly.  I'm happy with this purchase."
"Love, Love these shoes.  So comfy and stylish."
"The Columbia cotton stretch briefs are very comfortable and soft. They do have a large wide elastic waistband which can be uncomfortable. I think they needed the large waistband to stay in place while participating in sports but it does detract from the comfort. It is tag free which seems to be the norm among underwear nowadays.

The fabric is made to wick away moisture in aiding to keep you dry and comfortable. The briefs are 95% cotton and 5% spandex to offer stretch and give while retaining their shape."
"These are keepers,they fit tight after a while,I have to exchange them for the next size up wich is no problem,Franco Sarto is one of my most trusted brand of shoe I prefer to buy,along with Nine West,Bandolino,Guess,and Mias.

I recomend these if you love platform heels as much as I do."
"Maybe not small as in around my body, but the sleeves were a little shorter than I like...but I have very long arms. It will shrink.  It had shrunk a little just after washing and not drying...so I would suggest going a size up...that is why I ordered another one in a larger size."
"Bought this for my Uncle's new job (Santa), this will be part of his summer gig wardrobe. He likes it."
"I wear this hoodie all the time, I absolutely love it!"
"Thin and very warm, great product!"
Daughter loves them and they go with everything.
"material is soft and cool, fits nicely, roomy and comfortable. Can dress up or dress down, all-season wear  - in summer with sandals or flats, in fall and winter with tights and boots."
"This is a great bag, nice material, very cute and the perfect size."
Bought this for my 24 yr old husband and he loves it!
"Just got back from a week-long trip where I was able to use this back.  It had plenty of space for what I packed with quite a bit of room to spare as well.  It has a few pockets on the outside, but it could use an outer pocket that doesn't need to be unzipped to be accessed, such as a mesh pocket that can be used to quickly hold a water bottle or something like that.  The interior is roomy but it could also use a couple small pockets/dividers.  The handle for pulling the bag when wheeling it around has a zipped cover over it.  I suppose that could be useful, but in general I don't keep it zipped and having the unzipped flap there is more of a nuisance than a convenience.  Overall it feels like a solid no-frills bag."
"Zipper got snagged in fabric but could maneuver it to work again.  Had a repeated problem but still working.  Overall, it was very comfortable to wear.  As a matter of fact I had to keep checking to make sure it was still there!  I tied the excess elastic bands in a knot for additional ""peace of mind.""  Wore this on a mission trip to Lodwar Africa with SERV International and just make sure your passport is in a small plastic ziplock bag as your body sweat will soak through this and the contents.  (It did me...but what do you expect with 108 degrees!)"
"Just what I need for the long vacation coming up.  I purchased it because my old 28"" suitcase weighs 13# -- empty and with the new airline regulations on weight,  I needed a lighter suitcase.  I have not used it yet to see what the airlines will do to it, we will see."
Love all the legendary whitetail gear. If your an Xl order a large unless you prefer longer baggier fit.
Fits as expected. We will order this product again.
I tried them on and fit seemed good. I will be ordering more I ordered only one just to check and make sure that I liked them. I like that they do sizing not just one size fits all as I am very thin and one size does not fit all.. Very pleased also made in the USA another plus
Super cute! My daughter loves it!
Ordered these for my baby girl. It doesn't matter the style.to her as long as it has twinkle toe and pink on it that's what makes her happy and when she happy daddy is happy. Thanks twinkle toe for this product.
Love these.  Comfy.
"Very soft, stretchy and comfortable! May order in more colors. Red is true to picture."
"These boots look just like the picture.  I love them, they're super cute.  Other reviewers said that they run small and to buy a size up, but thankfully I got my regular size and they fit perfectly.  They look great with jeans or a skirt and I have a feeling I'll be wearing them a bunch."
"I just received my shirt and it fits perfect. Im 5'4 120 lbs, i got the raspberry color in medium and its still a bit loose which is what i like. The material is confortable. I cant wait to wear it to the pool."
"Very nice, and the price was great!!"
So soft! Purchased for my son. A great fit and truly something I would buy again.
The socks are darling and quite harmonious.  Thanks.
"great and comfortable skirt .
the hidden pockets are so useful."
VERY comfy and I hate having to give them up when they have to go in the wash.  Would live in these if possible.  Perfect for humid summers but still great for those cold nights while snuggling under the down comforter.
I have these heels in all different colors because they are the most comfortable heels around. I can wear them all day and my feet don't hurt plus they are adorable.
I love this bra because I can wear it with anything and it will not show through.  I am old school and do not like to see a bra through someone's bra showing through their shirt.
Im in love with this bought for my wedding AWESOME. AWW AWESOME 
Kind of long but beautiful for a real tall guy early christmas present! Delivered just on time!
I really like these shoes!!!! I usually wear a size 7.5-8 but after reading the reviews they seemed to run a little big. I ordered a size 7 and they fit perfect!! Totally happy with these shoes and the price!
It was perfect for my wedding that was about two years ago. The garter was not cheaply made and I wanted to have a little blue included so this was the perfect item for me.
"I have bought many stride rite shoes.  I absolutely love them.  I bought this ahead of time for my little one to grow into...little did I know he'd have wide feet.  So these didn't fit him well (should have bought them in wide...this was my fault, therefore I'm not reducing the number of stars I gave on my review). Otherwise they are super cute and I love that the velcro strap can't pull out of the little loop...the rubber end stops it from being completely pulled out so u don't have to rethread it thru (especially for a little bit who thinks its funny to undo his straps and try and take off his shoes constantly)."
Fits like other Birkenstocks. Does wear similar to flip flop since it only has one strap. Very comfortable!
So comfy! Fits well! Very cute! I love these. I already ordered another pair!
Crocs are pretty comfortable but not as good as Skechers easy fit. But a pretty decent show.
Love this piece! Unusual looking but a great conversation piece. A must-have!
The shorts are just what I was looking for and the price is right - and I didn't have to try on 15 pair to find the right ones thank you.
I bought this to go with my ring and they match really well the chain broke bvut got another one and I wear it everyday
Nice Shoe...
"A well-constructed piece of clothing is common, but not common enough. The stitching and material quality of this pair of shorts is right up there with the rest of the Dockers line; if you can/want to wear shorts, you could do worse. Much worse."
"Great shoe/spikes :-) !!! Light, comfortable, good quality, nice looking.  But,  they don't come with the spikes or spike tool."
"Needed an oxblood/burgundy belt to go with some recently purchased oxfords for a wedding, and decided to order this, due to style, buckle, and price.

The black side, which I doubt I will use because I have a nice black belt, looks like decent quality leather. The reverse side, however, as another reviewer mentioned, DOES look like plastic: smooth, shiny, polished and...plastic-like (maybe this is why its description is ""glazed""???). The black is NOT like this, but like true leather.

I ordered a 32, wear a 30, and it fits JUST right, so size is fine.

However, if I can find an oxblood/burgundy that looks more like REAL leather, I will return this. Otherwise I will keep it ."
"Got this for the Mrs. when she was nicknamed ""preggers.""  Everyone at work loved it on Halloween.  Border security might not like the joke though."
"Love my boots, thanks! "
Exactly what I expected and the fit is perfect.
"if you are looking for scrubs on the cheap side, not made cheap, but not paying full price buying on line is the way to go"
Nice dresses
Love it! Little shorter than I expected but fits perfect! Normally a size zero in Womens. Went with a size 1 in juniors
"I bought this for my daughter and I have to say, it is even more beautiful in person! It looks great over a dress I bought for her. It was shipped and arrived earlier than expected too."
Love the colors and will keep it.
"I bought these shoes for my daughter to wear with her school uniform on PE days. The Keds go great with shorts or skorts. It's a really cute shoe and excellent value. I love them! My daughter who hates tennis shoes, loves them too!"
Very simple but nice. Just what I was looking for.
"Already reviewed, but I didn't comment on fit. I went on the manufacturer's website, and followed their instructions on finding my perfect size. I used the measurements off of a leather jacket I currently owned (size 12 Calvin Klein) and they correlated to an XL in the Faneema jacket. Fit was perfect."
MY SON PUT THE SHOES AS SOON AS IRECIVED THEM  & they fit perfect
same as the other review on santa fe border print dress
"Over all, it fit well. It is rather long though."
"I absolutely love these laces.  We have them in my 7 year old son shoes and she loves them!  At school they will not tie kids shoes if they come undone, they will leave them walking around during like that all day long.  This is great and we don't have to worry about it at all.  They are great colors, we got pink and purple.  Super easy to use and put into your shoes.  I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased and honest review, but my opinions are my own. please vote that this review was HELPFUL if you found anything that I said to be of assistance, it motivates me to keep leaving reviews because I know they are not falling on deaf ears."
"More than anything, this set is a great bargain. It would be hard to put together an outfit at Target for that price and the style and quality exceed what I'd normally get there.

It can be hard to find clothes for little boys that are cute and stylish, but can still take a beating. These wash well, don't shrink too much, and will be outgrown before they can be worn out. It's a super cute little outfit and BLACK! So, although it can get fuzzy, it won't show stains.

I will say the the sizing is a bit on the small side. I'd order up, especially if your child is on the tall and thin side like my son. He'll outgrow the length in the torso soonest. I don't think it's worth docking a star... I wouldn't say it's off by a whole size... but I'd recommend ordering up.

That said, I'll remember this for gifts for kids. Such an adorable outfit that is kid approved and just the right price."
My daughter loves these and this is a great price!
kid loves getting chased with this
VERY COMFORTABLE AND AT A GREAT PRICE !!  LOVE 'EM !
This is very nice and exactly as pictured.  Will be used well.
Bought a few in different colors for my son but they run somewhat large and he still has not been able to used them.  Maybe this year they will fit him.  I kept them because I like them.
Velcro not very good. Otherwise fine
"This is my second pair of Yukon Crocs.  The heels on the first pair were just starting to show some wear but no where near the point of tossing them out.  I wear my Crocs instead of slippers and with a heavy pair of socks, they are good from early spring well into late fall.  During the summer, they are my ""go to"" footwear. I bought this latest pair only because I was going on vacation and wanted to treat myself. The leather tops and straps don't give away that they are what many think are ""hospital shoes"".  With a nice pair of khaki's and a blazer, I've even worn them to court and nobody noticed. Believe me, when you are standing on your feet belting out ""Objection !"", the last thing you want is for your feet to ache. I prefer the khaki color as they look a lot like a casual shoe. Slide the straps forward and they make great slip-ons.  Yukon Crocs are incredibly comfortable, versatile and reasonably priced. My only objection is that they are made in china. If they were made in the U.S., they'd be perfect."
"I purchased these pants for travel. They are thin and fit me well. They do need to be ironed after washing, but came out of the suitcase looking good."
The material is very soft but is also so thin that it makes you feel naked.  Feel a little uncomfortable wearing them due to them being so thin.
Timex 30 lap triathlon had been my watch for decades.  I lost one on a trip and had to replace it right away. Thank you amazon for a fair price and fast shipping.
These shoes are very comfortable and they look very nice (as do all of my Clark sandals).  The only problem I have is that the heels are lower that I am accustomed to but I am getting used to them and can wear them for long stretches of time with no problem.
Love these Traveltime shoes. So comfortable.
"So like others here, I was looking for an alternative to certain infamous brand that starts with an ""L"" and ends with an ""Ularoe.""

I love leggins.  All leggings.  Leggins with patterns, Leggings with prints, solid color leggings, doesn't matter.  What I don't love is paying $25 for them.  And I'm even less enthusiastic about being forced to attend a multi-level marketing/reverse funnel system ""party"" with distant acquaintances and making awkward small talk while I try to think of an excuse to just get my leggings and duck out early.  That is not my shopping style. That is my nightmare.  I'm definitely more of the do-your-shopping-at-3am-at-the-computer-in-ketchup-stained-undies type of shopper, if you will.

Now I can have it all!  I get cute, comfy leggings, and I get to indulge my crippling social anxiety!  The Viv leggings are just as soft (possibly softer) and as high quality as the other brand.  They don't have the wide waist band style, just the elastic waist style, but it does go all the way up to the waist line, so that works.  Additionally, they are nice and opaque with no awkward crotch bunching.  I'm a size 4, 5'6"" and they fit me perfectly and have a nice length to them.

Also I'm not sure if Viv reads these things, but if they do I wanted to say:

Hey guys I love your brand, but please come out with more patterns!  While I do love paisley and zig-zags, I see a lot of potential for a greater diversity of patterns. And I'm looking to reeeeally lean into my legging addiction hard...  Right now I'm in the ""holding down a job, hiding it from friends and family"" territory.  But I'm hoping to move into the ""barefoot, begging with a cardboard sign at the underpass"" space by the end of next quarter.  I believe you are the brand to take me there.

Anyways, these are my leggings now, and I'm never looking back!"
I am very happy with these shoes. My feet are wide and I have a hard time finding shoes that fit me. They even came with an extra pair of shoelaces. I plan to buy another pair when these start to wear out.
I purchased this item for myself because it was advertised as plus size. I am a size 22 or 3XL. I ordered this in a 3XL and expected it to fit just right. I believe the image is deceptive because the arms on the item are a bit shorter than shown. They are also ruched which causes them to fit a bit tighter on my arm. I would also say this item is shorter than the image appears because it falls just at my waist. I expected it to fall below my waist. The material is soft and the color grey is true. It shrunk only a bit when I washed it. I would recommend this product because it is well made and has stood up to numerous washing sessions. I was able to purchase this item at a discount for review purposes.
I love these shoes! Great for the road and trails. I will definitely be buying another pair when my current ones wear out.
"Bought these 26 Jun 16 and have been wearing them casually around town, cycling, and running.  I haven't dropped them, sat on them, etc.  When I'm not using them they live in their hard case.  I was out for a walk today (8 Jul 16) and noticed some haloing off the left lens as I was headed into the sun.  I took a closer look and noticed a micro fracture running the length of the lens and several more small ones originating at the nose piece.  These are nice glasses, but they didn't even make it two weeks and I have to send them back to native along with $30.  I'll get my money back if Native determines it is a manufacture defect.  I'll update my review in about 10-15 days once I know the disposition.  My Oakley E-wires last 8 years before any issues.

**UPDATE**  Upgrading from two to four stars.  So Native excepted my return and sent me a new pair of glasses.  So far so good; I really do like these.  They fit well and look cool."
Love love love it's my fav by far....REALLY CUTE
Wroth the money!
My son likes these socks. They last a reasonable length of time before getting holey. Good value pricing.
"This is a nice bracelet, especially for the price.  It is stylish and tasteful. It's one of those pieces to wear when you want to look good without looking like you ""tried too hard""!"
Veryconfotable and extremelylight
This is a very comfortable pull over. The interior material is a fleece so it keeps me warm but not too warm since it's still thin. It's perfect for Fall/Spring type weather.
"Nice PJs. I prefer a bit more stretch, but these are warm and comfortable. I will certainly be wearing them."
LOVED IT!  Purchased because my dog ate my daughters veil.  Amazon Prime saved us!  It's so pretty!
They are grate my second pair they look good were  ever i go easy to take care of thanks Michael
"Love these boots! They keep my feet so warm and I wore them all day the first time. Comfortable, cute, waterproof and so very warm. I wish I would have bought these sooner for myself."
"Size choice covered a large area 12.5 to 14 so I figured they would be a bit sloppy, but they work."
Super soft and comfy. I wear these for yoga.
"A little longer than expected,  but it looks like it has a good zipper and washes well."
"These are so cute and fun. They are warm for tiny feet. They are a bit bigger than expected, but we don't mind because we layered with socks and they now fit really well."
"This shirt is very good material. He loved it. It fit perfectly. He's a 2X and very tall, and it came down to a good length and looks very nice."
These shoes are great!  Cute AND comfy- the best combination!
Love it! It's comfy and I receive a lot of compliments when I wear it :)
I love these. I walk miles at the zoo in them. They're so comfy and really cute!
Love my Cushe patrollers
"I was really looking for a 'Dark Chocolate' brown dressy/casual sandal to wear with sun dresses that I could either dress up or dress down.  These were not as dark as I wanted them to be but, the design was different and that is a big thing for me.  I haven't worn them yet but I'm planning on wearing them soon."
"Great shoes, nice support for my son who pronates..."
Love them!!! My daughter and I both wear these.
Awesome shirts me and my fiance both wear them out ... fit perfectly... fast delivery... looks just like the picture.
My son only wears Under Armour shorts. LOVE them!
"Perfect fit for summer dress.  I took it on my cruise and it was flowy and cool.  I am 5'10 and it sat right above my ankle.  It does have these strings that hang from the shoulders that annoyed me, but I'll either deal with it or remove them.  Otherwise love the dress"
"Love these pants!!! Material is nice and soft, the fit is great.  Wish they had them in different colors - would definitely buy them.
NYDJ are the best!!!"
"EXCELLENT SHOE, MY FAULT I BOUGHT THEM TOO BIG.  SHOES ARE TRUE TO SIZE.  I RETURNED THEM AND THEY REFUNDED ME RIGHT AWAY AND I ORDERED ANOTHER PAIR SMALLER SIZE."
"Love this watch.  Keeps great time, looks good, and it's tough.  I accidentally forgot to take it off while rock scrambling a couple of times, and it still looks good. And the price it great for a solar watch."
Nice shoe and very pretty. They are very comfy too. I would buy them again.
Super cute! Look great and fit baby well.
Sexy and unique . It's is tight at the neck but I have a small chest so I made it work
"These are in the running as my travel shoes when I head overseas.  They look good, are true to size (7.5 here), are very comfortable, and are extremely lightweight."
"the large is very roomy. I could have ordered a medium, but I like to layer it."
"I purchased these for my husband. He loves them. I had ordered XXL because he is 5' 11"" and 245 lbs.  He normally wears XL but he likes his pj's a little loose. He wore out a pair that were too small for my son. They machine wash well."
"I am very happy with these slacks!  Feel good, look great.  Plus, they come pre-cuffed in most sizes---even ""difficult"" ones. Highly recommended. Cost less than half of what comparable quality pants from other vendors cost."
I loved this dress but it was to small so it sent it back  if it comes out in a bigger size I will order it again
Not good to wear consecutively. Wearing as everyday shoes you will get a good 6 months. Good shoes if you rotate. Love the color.
"I wish the leather was a little more flexible, but they should break in with wear.  Also, for those of us with high arches it would help if the zipper went a little bit further down.  But they're great looking, I look forward to cooler weather so I can wear them."
Very soft and keeps fit wash after wash.
"These are the softest pants ever!  They were on sale for $5.35/pair, and after purchasing the first pair for my granddaughter, I purchased two more pair, fortunately in her size and at the same price!  This was probably the best value I've ever found on Amazon.  Thank you!"
"My husband is a tall man. He sometimes has to work in bad weather, so he was delighted to find out that this was water resistant. It doesn't look like a raincoat, but it does repel water. Great! It is comfy."
"Love the way it feels, but the large size was a little small on my 35"" waist. I guess I need the Xtra-large next time."
"Cheep, but it works"
Love at first sight!!!!
"I love this bag! It is small enough to carry the basics, not clunky... it wipes clean easy, and it absolutely adorable. The straps are quite small as I am sure this was meant for a toddler but I am 27 years old and have a pretty small body frame so it fits me perfectly on the biggest setting. If you have large arms or a large body frame I wouldn't suggest buying this for yourself."
Good sturdy shoes for my 12 year old daughter.  We'll see how they hold up in the river.
"I liked these a lot, just a warning though. I bought these to have lots of extra pairs of socks but the amount of time it takes to match them all up is almost not worth it. I like them but I wouldn't order them again."
My kids lot it. I brought my whole family this sandal and they all look great!!!
"These are just old school sneakers.  Pull them on lace them up and go. If I had to list one negative it would be that they have no heel stiffness at all, you practically need a heel spoon to put them on as the heel just collapses."
I absolutely love this tote! I use it daily as a rolling briefcase for my laptop and files. It is designed better than other laptop rolling totes. And much lighter and roomier.
A lots of sparkles! Will have to wear it frequently to get used to it.
"This is an excellent bag.
The main pocket includes a padded laptop section in it (fits my 14"" comfortably).  I can also fit a small rolled up rain jacket and big notebook in this main section.
Then there is another smaller pocket that fits all my cables and pens I need to take with me.

I have been caught out in a decent shower and the contents of my bag all remained dry.  I would definitely buy this bag again."
"Love them. They are kind of a spandex material, which I love. They keep my legs very snug. They could've been a little thicker, as far as socks go but they are great for the spring and summer."
"I wanted a lightweight boot with a bit more support than my several pairs of existing Rockport shoes for knocking around on weekends, light hikes and wet weather. These look and feel to fit the bill. Size is a relative and individual matter, and on my very average 10.5 feet they fit well  - leaving enough room for heavier socks and a replacement insert that I use in all of my shoes. The sole appears to be more rugged than street Rockports . just what I wanted. Build and material quality looks to be about average for these days but not to the quality of a genuine work boot, still, I expect they will hold up well.. I have had many different pairs of Rockports and have always been satisfied. These are no exception."
My son is very happy with these!
These are adorable Robeez but are way too wide for my daughters feet.  These would be perfect for a baby with chubby feet.  They were tough for my daughter to walk in because of the extra bulk of the shoes.  Very cute and great quality.
It fit my son to a T. He is 11. No alteration and had the perfect break at the top of shoe. He grows out of this one and I will bye again!
Super cute.  Fit as I expected Gerber to fit.
"Very surprised at how well made this dress is. I use it under a see-through long sleeve lace dress. It works perfectly! I would use it alone as well if I had the right accessories for it. It is not see-through, so it can stand alone on its own as a dress. It's a nice surprise. The price is right. The fit is perfect. I usually wear a small, but ordered  a medium and it fits very nicely."
Bought as a gift. Niece loves it
I Love them and have since bought three more pairs.  I've been wearing them for sometime before giving this review.  They are the 'barefoot' series so you have to keep that in mind when you purchase them.  They are all I wear now when it comes to 'athletic' shoes.  I work in them all day as well and have no complaints whatsoever.  I get compliments on them whenever I wear them as well.
Somewhat small in size but the boys are all fans so it gets worn.
"Love these so much I bought a second pair in a different color. Bought one size larger, as per other reviews and they're great."
"I generally prefer my bras to be lined and not padded, like this one.  But there are occasions in which one does not want their nipples showing.  This bra is good for that purpose.  It's padded just enough for coverage.  I found the shaping to be very natural-looking in my size, which is 34A.  BTW, toasted coconut is a nice neutral color."
"After wash, they became short."
I love these slippers  they are so soft and easy to slip on and off
Nice quality. Nice clasp. I thought I ordered the 24 inch but most have accidentaly selected the 19 inch. Quite handsome and still fits around my husband's neck.
So much fun -  wearing for Halloween
My new go-to socks!
Great quality product. Nice cloth & material
These are the best muscle shirts I have found so soft and seem to be pretty durable.  getting more.
"Arrived early.  Looks good. I got this, the necklace, and he earrings to wear to an event.  I like them all.  can't wait to wear them."
Nice presentation good ship time.
Very happy with the shirt. I'm 5-10 240 and it fits me well.
"Florsheim boots are quality. Fine leather. Well made. Vibram soles. The width is broader than I need. But truly fine looking, durable, rugged even. Wear casual wear dress."
"They're clunky and ugly and messy. They can be a hassle to put on just right. They're dangerous on tile floors. But they work better on ice and compacted snow than anything else I've tried, and I've tried every major competitor plus a bunch of cheapie knockoffs.

I only bought these because my original pair that I bought 15 years ago finally wore out--one of the toe straps wore through. I tend to be hard on shoes, and hard on these too. So 15 years is pretty impressive. The cleats do wear down, some more than others, but are good for at least a season, and are easy to replace. I've found that getting a bagful of cleats every other year is enough to replace the ones that wear out.

The new pair look identical to the old ones. Good to see that they haven't messed with a design that works.

They're worth the money. They work. They last for years and years. Get a bag of the cleats so you'll have them ready to swap in at the start of next season."
Beautiful Frye boots very comfortable
"i was searching for the best feeling boxers, i was buying hanes ultimate boxers at target like a five pack for 25 and they started to pil after only a few months, they never did that before not sure what changed, but, the ones with the elastic on top give way after  few months my guess dryer does them in yet they never pilled and next grade up premiums have a covered waist band but the cottonpoly blend is not really comfortable more like work wear underwear, i don't like all the cotton ones that look like boxer tidy whiteys, cause they hold your nuts up, your testicles are supposed to be able to rise and fall with your bodys temperature. they are literally like a thermostat for a man, if they cannot hang it can damage your sperm motility and count, and effect your testosterone levels which is probably why sperm counts have fallen by more than 40 % in the last 20 yrs, too many tight skinny jeans and these leotard looking underwear,, your junk needs to dangle. these are extremely comfortable, almost silk like , they actually feel cooler when your hot than my regular boxers, at 11 bucks a pop they are pricey,  but soooooooooooooo worth it, if your into silky smooth softness without the icky ness of silk, too me silk can feel sticky when your sweaty these wick sweat away, if you have a girlfriend or wife you can be guaranteed if she can fit in these she will be stealing them, awesomeness, now if they were just a tad cheaper, they would reign supreme, except for all those speedo and thong wearing grape smugglers out there that are too ignorant to know its not good for you.
real men should wear loose boxers , or a kilt. lol tarzan skin would work too, or just go original olympic, lol"
"Great shoe, have several pair in different colors and materials."
"I bought for my girlfriend and she really love it. It is very shiny and girls who like gold colors will probably like. The very bad side of this product: it doesn't even come in a box, but in little cheap plastic bag."
Fitted comfortable work shirt
They will look great for the wedding for the guys
"I bought these to wear to work. I am a Kinder. teacher and I needed something that looked professional but could hold up to lots of bending, sitting, and crawling on the floor with the kids. Really easy to care for!

I bought a black pair and a grey pair. The gray pair is my favorite! Really nice looking and great material."
Second time that I purchased these shirts. I get compliments everywhere I go when I wear them out.  They look super cute on me too
"It gets five stars --- not because the enamel is great.  It's not.  And not because the overall quality is wonderful.  It's not.

It gets give stars because it's a $4.27 set of costume jewelry, with free shipping, and I didn't expect perfection.  More, it arrived from China before some of the American-shipped orders I'd placed the very same day.  I was pleasantly shocked: The actual delivery was a month before the estimated delivery.

Would I wear it in around a discerning group of people wearing Bulgari at an upscale soiree?  Oh, heavens, no.  But for a funky, chunky, I-don't-care-if-I-lose-it-on-vacation-in-the-Islands piece?  It's $4.27 perfection."
Great looking vest
"I have purchased this product many times. It's near impossible to find my favorite shade in my hometown so I have to resort to online purchases. The stockings last longer than most, are washable and worth the purchase."
Great shoe. Best price after checking other retailers. Fast delivery
"These are nice strong shoelaces, which I hope will last a long time. They are a tiny bit thicker than my old laces (even though I measured my old laces before ordering), but they still work in my leather booties. All in all, I am quite satisfied with them."
Fit and feel nice bit something in them will  occasionally  poke me. Insulation? Fibers? Other than that they are great so far.
Fantastic quality and so versatile. Great purchase.
A nice piece even though I don't wear costume pieces but I enjoyed this one
Super cute! And shipping came much faster than anticipated!
"I began coaching my son's t-ball team and did not want to wear my softball cleats, so the AIr Diamond Trainer is a perfect solution.  They have the 'baseball ready' look and are very comfortable."
A little snug but otherwise very comfortable. Very soft. It rises a little bit in the leg occasionally but nothing too bad. Would definitely buy more
Pretty shoe. So happy to have found it.
Cute but you may need to tape the sides down
very cute and fit well. Shipping is not bad.
"After reading the other reviews I ordered a large rather than medium. Glad I did! The top was very small but after removing the added padding I was able to fit into it snugly. The shorts fit like boy-shorts, very snug but still very cute. This swimsuit would be great for Tweens or young teens. The large size without the added padding is about a B cup. Overall happy with the purchase. Fast delivery and good quality."
"I love doctor who! my brother doesn't watch the show, but he likes this shirt. the colors and artwork are very cool and it's a good regular sturdy tshirt."
Finally I found the right fit.  Very comfortable and no rolling at the top of the chest that shows through my tops.
"Just what I expected; perfect. My husband, who never likes anything, really LIKES it!!!
Thank you Amazon Prime."
I have bought and worn many flip flops over the years!  This is the most comfortable by far!  I bought my first pair last summer and have now purchased my second pair in black.  I'm sure I will be purchasing more in different styles/colors in the future!
"Very obviously not high quality, but real cute.  I bought these for my teenage daughter and she adores them.  An adult might find fault with the plasticity un comfortableness, but she doesn't."
I am 5'3' and 120 lbs. Fits great. Using as a cover-up. Color is pink with rust colored print ( It looked black in the pix )
Really cute and well made pants for my great granddaughter.  They fit a little large in the waist and maybe 2-3 inches long.  She is growing a lot and a little thin.
This is an adorable swimsuit. It looks great on my 8 year old daughter. She loves it.
"I took a risk and bought this ""slightly imperfect"" shawl, because the price was amazing.  The shawl is gorgeous, and I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.  I got the turquoise and black one, and the color looks incredible in the picture.  In real life, the color is even richer and more beautiful.  I'm already planning my outfit around this wonderful shawl.  I cannot wait to show it off."
"Before purchasing this skirt, I made sure to read the reviews on what size I should order. Because the sizes on these skirts are measured based on the Asian girls it can run a little small. After carefully reading through the reviews I decided to order a medium just to be safe. I made a good decision choosing a size larger than what I usually wear. The skirt arrived was delivered quickly and was packaged neatly. The only thing I do not like about the dress is that it has a weird shape when its puffed out.
I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
So cool. Daughter loved them.
I like my new wallet. Though it wasn't what I got was not what I ordered as I got black and brown I still like it a lot.
"This shirt feels very nice for an under scrub top. It's soft and silky and breathable. At the end of my 10 hour shift, it wasn't all sweaty like most of my undershirts. By far this is the best under shirt I've found for my scrubs so far. I love Wonder Wink!"
"I get lots of compliments on this dress. For the price it's a great little dress to wear to a Con or just out and about. I'm 5'4"" and weigh 125 lbs. The dress fit me perfectly."
"So I can't say enough good about prime delivery with this item.  It came to my backdoor the morning we hit a cold snap, totally made my morning.  It's extremely warm IMO.  It's quite comfortable - I'm 5'2"" and it hits just above / at my knees but doesn't make me look michellin man like.  My ONLY complaint (and reason for not giving five stars) is that I wish there were more room in the shoulders.  I have athletic shoulders and arms and it's a little constricting to my range of motion but not uncomfortable particularly.  The color is a really nice and plummy.  I am looking forward to getting a lot of wear out of it this winter!"
"A little big, but going to keep them."
Nice glasses!
"My daughter loves these boots! However, I followed everyone's advice and bought a size larger. They are too big! I would say stick with your original size."
"I'm 5'6, 120 lbs and I bought a small and they fit perfectly. They make my butt look fantastic and the elasticity makes everything stay put. I already have quite a cute butt, but these leggings raise it a number. I enjoyed strutting around the gym in them showing off my even tighter (thanks to these hot pants) buns. Did an hour on the treadmill and weights afterwards and never had to readjust to make sure they hugged my curves perfectly. I highly suggest them if you need a self image boost and a few guys to do a double take."
also received a veery think chain that I did not order ?
These earrings are beautiful and will go nicely with the other smoky quartz jewelry I have.  It also goes well with my chocolate diamonds.
"I wore this for my very small, semi casual wedding two years ago today actually. I originally ordered a 3x but sent it back and got a 2x instead which proved to be a much better fit. If you aren't sure on sizes, I would go a size down because I feel it runs a little big. The lace was a bit more cream colored than I anticipated but it worked well for me. I'm 5' tall and it was a bit below midcalf for me, but above the ankle. I don't think that the quality of materials is necessarily worth the $100 price tag but I did really like the dress. Considering dying it and using it for other occasions."
"So warm and cozy, daughter loves these.  Be careful they are so good you might end up wearing them to the store!"
"I love it. I bought it to put my cocktail rings and it's great. The top is not glass, and that's what I like especially when having small kids running around the house. Highly recommended it."
Great deal and the ring looks great!
"Absolutely love my new watch - beautifully balanced, feminine and sporty.  Quality you expect from Victorinox Swiss Army.  This is my 4th watch made by them and won't be my last.  Highly recommend.  Package came with original box, papers and 3 yr manufacturer warranty.  100% satisfied customer.  :-)"
Perfect.  I usually wear a size 8m but needed size 9 in his style.
Great shirt that looks like a sweater but not too thick or heavy.  Great look and feel.  Wish I could order all the colors!
It was an amazing gift for my nephew. He loved it
"LOVE THESE!!! They are perfect size! Not to big, not to small. They are very pretty. I would recommend these over all the rest! Very good seller as well :)"
Love love love these shoes...absolutely comfortable right out of the box.  I added a alpaca foot insert to help keep my feet warm. Now they are perfect ..at least so far...first pair purchased. ..will see how they ware and how long they last...
"Very lightweight with good support.  Toe box a little low, touches top of big toe."
I hate padded bras and these are great inside your bra to keep your nipples from showing through my tops.  They stick to the skin well and I received them promptly.  I highly recommend getting more than one set because the adhesive loosens  after about two months if you wear them everyday although you can actually still use them still inside the bra but when you take it off they drop.  With the adhesive you pull them off.
love it i ll be buying more
An shortwaisted so these are really good for me. Length is perfect
My bridesmaids looked amazing.
great belt. love the feel
Nice looking bag. Bought it for my Mother. Design is pretty cool.
"Love these so much! They are exactly what I was looking for. Like most shoes, the first couple of times I wore them, my skin was irritated from where the shoe hit it on the front but it only took a couple of times to get used to it. I walk a good amount at work and these are stylish and wearable there! These are my go-to fall healed shoes!"
"I love this gorgeous, sterling silver, cuff, bracelet!
I am very impressed at how classy and elegant such a simple piece can be.
The cuff is made well with a beautifully polished and smooth finish.  It is easy to get on and off, yet stays in place comfortably.
It sells at a reasonable price and comes packaged in Amazon's lovely dark-blue boxes.  It is quite an impressive gift.
I have larger wrists and some cuffs look terrible on me but this one is perfect with almost a delicate look.
I like that one of the X pieces is thicker than the other(which I didn't think I was going to like) because it really adds interest and dimension to the cuff.  This is a great addition to many wardrobe styles and will last a long time."
These are so adorable! We got them for my 3 year-old for soccer. Headwear screen to school too and loves them. I will eventually get longer laces as they are short and hard to tie. They have worked great instead of cleats for his age.
love them. good quality.
"these are nice sneakers, get a lot of compliments."
"I love these slippers. Warm, but not too warm. I wear an 8.5US and the 8.5 fit just right.
 It's a slipper, so while they do offer some support in the sole, it is not as much as a Keen shoe you might wear outdoors.
The quality is what I expected from a Keen product."
"For small and mid size breasts, this is a wonderfully comfortable bra. The fabric is wonderful on the skin, and provides moderate support. If you are pondering size, opt for the smaller one. I find it runs a bit big."
"Love them, really nice quality for price. Son was happy to have them to wear with his tux for prom :)"
"Fits it's purpose, plain no frills"
"This is a lovely watch.  I was worried about the color but it is just
fine...a hint of pink...does not clash with my gold jewelry."
Just too big otherwise I liked them!
"I already had the black version of this watch with the blue second hand. That's still my absolute favorite watch ever.  I wanted to buy this one since I liked the other so much.  It gives me a lighter colored alternative.  The carbon fiber in the links and face is a very unique feature.  The watch wears heavy on the wrist which I prefer.  I'm tall with big hands so I love the bigger watch face and feel. This is actually my fourth Precisionist and probably my tenth Bulova.  I used to buy Citizen and Seiko, but have become pretty brand loyal to the Precisionist line of Bulova.  The only thing you have to watch for is the six tiny hex bolts around the bezel.  There's a potential to snag a shirt sleeve now and then, but not anything I really worry about.  I also had to replace the battery on another precisionist a few weeks back.  I was nervous it'd be pricey, but was only around $10.  Not bad at all.  I highly recomend this watch, but guy the black one first.  It'll get you lots of compliments."
"I am in Minnesota, the UGG's are perfect for our weather."
Birthday present for our son. Very happy with it.
"These are comfortable sandals, but I wonder if the foot bed, unlike other Earth sandals I have, is synthetic because my feet broke out in a rash and blisters after I wore them for a whole day. It seems that the quality of Earth shoes has declined recently which is a great pity as these are the only shoes I can wear."
"My daughter wore this to be Olivia at school.  Very funny, good quality!  Works as described looks just like picture."
perfect Scarf
Worked great for my resent trip and helped to keep my things organized.
They fit well and they are double layered in the front.
Great shirt for Abaddon cosplay. Looks great and fits well. Very happy with my purchase!
These have always worked well for me.  You must renew them every hour or two in the very hot sun.
purchased a 3-pack sized small for my shoes to try.  I wear a men's sized 10.5 medium width US and my dress shoes fit perfectly with room to spare.  Excellent fit for my needs.  The material was a nice soft fleece/flannel.  Not thin either.  I will definitely be ordering more.
"I ordered these pants at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I am so happy with them! I am 58 140lbs (I carry my extra weight in the baby pouch area) and I ordered the size large in Texas Arch Pomegranate. They fit me great and I was so happy that they are long enough!! In fact they brush the floor just a bit which is the way I was hoping they would fit, just like the Amazon photo. They look very much like the Amazon photo and have a fold over panel. The material is thin, soft, and is cool to the touch. They are very comfortable to wear (I am very picky about comfort) and I think they look good dressed up or just casual with a t shirt. The legs are very wide and sometimes even looks like you are wearing a long skirt, its very pretty. They are flattering and create the look I was hoping for, the thigh part of the leg is a bit more tapered (not much just a tad) so you can see a bit of your leg shape when you walk and then the rest just flows. I have a hard time getting the correct size when ordering online but these work great for me I am really happy. As I said before I am picky about comfort and sensitive to things that are too tight or have seams that rub but I thought these looked comfortable and they truly are. I have worn them all day and don't feel like I need to come home and change right away. The tag says to hand wash these in cold but I put them in the washer on a quick cycle and so far they have done fine. I do hang dry them though just to be safe. Overall I get lots of compliments, and haven't had any quality issues with them."
"I got these for my 3 year old in the Monterey raspberry. I was surprised by how bright of a pink they are, love them! My daughter is so excited to have shoes she can put on herself. They're cozy for her and she can run in them. They run true to size.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
"Works great on all of my leather shoes & belts. Reduces visible creases and small marks, evens the color a bit (no color change) and conditions. Does dry to a matte finish, which is a matter of taste, but I do wish I could buff to a shine for some of my shoes without an additional polish step as I condition more often than polishing.  Easy to apply (consistency of a lotion) and doesn't take much to cover a lot of area."
Awesome product!  Shipped to me quickly and it works very well on my laptop bag handle that's just a little too short.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has the same problem.
"Love them, fit well"
My son loves this sneakers.  They look very nice.
Fits perfect & looks Beautiful; just like out of a the jewelry store.
Have been wearing them for about 2 weeks now and find them very comfortable. Ordered the 5W this time and find they are a little loose without heavy soxs; but that is OK with me.  They are easy on - off; light weight; well cushioned; very flexable; generally very comfortable.  Now if the soles and thin suede tops wear well - could't be better.
Great well make backpack.  I will get a lot of use out of this.  I recently took it on a trip to Cuba and it worked out perfectly. It made a great carry on bag and well as an everyday sightseeing bag.  Held a lot of stuff and had a lot of compartments and pockets yet not that big to be bulky and in the way.
Love this hat. Fits great and looks cool! Great price too.
"Love love the dress, good quality and fit"
"Very nice! My husband loves it, looks unique and sizing right on! Metal will be lasting and no tarnish. Shipping very quick, well packaged! DEFINETLY worth the money!"
"I have style 10 (paisley: orange, yellow, gold, pink, blue...something else). I wear ties to work and I've had the same ties for about twenty years so I thought I'd buy some new ONES! Anyway, I've bought the $10 six-packs from other vendors and they're crap honestly. These seem pretty solid, and they are GORGEOUS. The colors are right in line with the photos. Time will tell how long they last, but they definitely feel thicker and of better construction than the others."
Very nice for the price.  Comfortable.  Fit me well.  Cotton material is a lint magnet!  Deducted a star for that reason.
Dad loves them. Nice and soft.
"Nice little box that holds my cufflinks, watches, collar stays, and other assorted jewelry or accessories. My one minor complaint is that I with the front flap that closes over the drawers was held in place by a magnet vs. the latch attached to the top cover. It's not ""bad"" per se, but one-handed operation of the latch isn't always that easy, and the magnet solution would still keep it in place while being easy to open."
They are well made and fit well.  I wear them often because they are comfortable
"Fit perfect, looked great and kept my grandson warm."
fits is perfect.  this dress goes anywhere!
"I love these pants, Comfortable, slimming and durable. Washes well. Looks great too."
Dress is very cute. Came quickly and shipped in a plastic zip bag to keep it clean. Exactly as described.
Love it! Can't wait to wear it to Nick Offerman's comedy show.
Very comfy and cozy.
"Nice light, comfortable material but couldn't find the right fit - the large was a bit snug but the xl is a bit baggy."
Beautiful quality and size!
"i wear jeans 3 times or so before i wash them, unless they get dirty. if you wear them once and then put them in the wash, you shouldn't run into the issue that i am having. after a long single wear (10 hours or so) or after the 2nd wear, these jeans loosen up a lot - more so than the other brands of jeans that i own. the waist stretches at least an inch, probably more. the legs at the thigh get really get baggy too. if they didn't loosen up so much, i would give these 5 stars, easily. i have been washing them after a single wear, but since i am a single guy and only do laundry once a week, they might sit on a pile for 5 days until i do a wash. so i ""solved"" that problem by buying a 2nd pair. as long as they are right out of the wash, the fit is good. seems true to size. they get a bit longer after a couple wears and bunch up at the shoe."
"Love...looks great, classy, and zipper is very nice. Perfect size for me. Carries a little makeup and necessities..."
Really cool-looking shoe. Fits just a bit small.
"The shield itself is awesome, just not as heavy and solid as it looks and or I wanted, and it did have 2-3 small scratches on the front of the shield, on the red and in the star. nothing to cry and return the shield for, I can live with it. But now that I have it, $90.00.....maybe worth more like $50.00, it's not that solid, has more of a light plastic feeling to it.  But it's going up on my wall (man cave), so It's cool, it'll work."
"Not much to say about them; I've worn Levi's for decades. They always have the same fit, and they wear like iron. Other than dress
occasions, they're all I wear."
Excellent and very stylish product very very comfortable
love these shoes...stylish & comfortable. love the black & bronze.  bought in tan/bronze color also.
"I purchased these boots as a gift for my mother, she is 67 years old and still rocking.

She absolutely loves them.

Comfortable and great looking, she gets compliments whenever she wears them.

Size 9 US fit her perfectly, great support and she can wear them all day without complaint."
This slider is great. My granddaughter will love it.
I got a large and it fit as expected.  The size I normally wear.  The shirt looks beautiful and flattering on.  I love it
"Fits perfectly, warm and toasty.  Washes well, I am happy with this purchase."
Its for my daughters Cosmetology Class!
"Nice chain, gold color is a good match for gold heart(18K)."
I got this and love it. I like the pattern the only thing is the should part is weird.
"I am a medical assistant so i live in scrubs every day. I purchased a size M and it fits perfect and it comes with a string to tie in the back. The top has two pockets in front and comes in several cute prints.

I received this product for free/discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions, positive or otherwise and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own."
The pants fit well and I liked them a lot.  The length could have been a little longer for us long legged people.
"I love the color of this shirt and the unique look of it, but the fabric is really thick. It keeps it's very bell-like shape, which means I'm always accidentally sweeping things off tables and desks with the side wings. The pocket is cool for chapstick, but is super shallow, so if you were hoping to use it when you wore leggings to cart around your cell phone, i hope you have a tiny phone. I get compliments on it when i wear it, because it IS so unique, but I don't wear it that often."
"Got these for my Mom, she loves them, made a bit wider than the ""swoosh "" company,  very light weight."
Nice heavy duty western cut shirt.  I bought it for a gift for my Montana relative and they love it.
"Great product, great price and excellent service........Thank you very much for all you do in terms of serving customers."
Makes a great baby shower gift :)
"Great color and cute style for all day comfort.
Would not wear as evening shoe just a bit too casual."
"i would rate them 4 star.  the shoes look great on screen and in person.  i just opened the box.  But, the ""relaxed fit"" description---that means they run about one full size too big.  I have to return them.  so, if you see the phrase ""relaxed fit"" on screen, you know it means ""runs big.""  end of story."
"So comfortable!  I work on a college campus, so these are GREAT for all the walking (and sometimes running) between buildings!"
Can't wait to troll my fellow nerds.
"I found these by accident when ordering some mules/clogs.  Love the idea.  Covering for the front of the foot, open on the heel where the clog/mule is open.
Not sure if they will be 'slippery' or not...
I haven't worn or washed them yet.  Definitely need a lingerie bag, or hand wash..."
"This is my third pair of these shoes.  They are perfect with shorts or a skirt.  They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned.  I can wear them all day long right out of the box.  The wedge is low, but still looks stylish.  I have worn two pairs out.  I just hope they are still around when these are ready to be replaced."
"Good quality, would order again"
"Wish you would make this shirt in long sleeve, other than that I love it!!!!"
"My son loves them, I bought a 5T, he is 4 y.o. and just fits.  He will not be able to wear them 8 months from now but that's okay"
Very pleased! Excellent shoes!
Very pretty and fit as expected for my size.
I bought this for a gift to give to one of the kids teachers. It arrived on time as described. We did take it out and test it. We live in Chicago and this really did stand up to the wind. I will also have to say very nice handle and a button that opens automatically. We are very pleased and we are assured that this will be a great gift . Presentation is beautiful
Absolutely beautiful and well crafted.
Basic but just what I needed for security checks at work. No more removing my belt!
So hard to put on any bracelet that has a clasp when you live by yourself.  I am now wearing bracelets that I haven't been able to wear in a very long time.  It does sometimes take me awhile to get it hooked because my eyesight isn't what it used to be but it really is a lifesaver.
"Awesome ! Comfortable with great style !
This shoe is like walking through clouds."
"Exactly as advertised. FUN.  Soft, flexible, party type sweater or just wearing around when you're not going to be getting dirty!"
"Bought it for my grandma, the top was to short. Anyway my sister loved it so i left it with her in the UK"
"This is good quality, soft and fits well. I can't complain"
Looks nice for the outfit I was wanting it for. Not really meant to be put through belt loops. A little too wide for that.
"Keep poo in, fits great."
Purchased these as work shirts for my husband.  He reports they fit well.  They laundered well and did not twist or shrink.  Very pleased with this purchase.
"The printing on this hat was a little big, But my Dad likes it."
"very cute for my 9 year old little girl. she hasn't seen it yet, but I know she will love it"
"i haven't had the time to wear these yet because it's summer, but they're mostly comfortable and very warm. which is why I haven't given them a real go yet."
it's small than my other 7 For All Mankind Men's Carsen jeans
"I've purchased several pairs of these slippers.  I must reveal that I can go barefoot all day, so I'm not looking for arch support; there is none.  They keep keep my feet warm, machine wash and dry very well, and look fine.  I will continue to buy these."
"Granddaughter loves her first Minnie Mouse watch, works great"
"I got this for my daughter's birthday, as she'd been saying that she wanted a music-themed necklace.  It's very pretty, but the one pictured is better quality than what I got.  The soldering in person is a good bit more evident than in the image, and the silver itself isn't as smooth.  I'm considering replacing the chain because as someone else noted, it came already partially tangled and will probably continue to tangle with wear.

Still very pretty an a lot more eye catching than most of the other musical note jewelry to be found, without being gaudy.  The polishing cloth is a small, but appreciated bonus."
Got these as a gift for my sister who has a hard time finding pants that fit her curvy backside and still stay up. These were a shot in the dark but fit amazing.
"This shoe is comfortable, and very cute.  I makes me feel so feminine."
36c ordered C size. Worked great for me with body con dresses not sure if I would trust it with loose fitting clothing after first time use. I did wear it with a spaghetti strap skater dress to a hot summer wedding stayed in place while dancing but i felt the urge to continuously press it down then again this was like my 3rd use so the adhesive was not a strong as the first time. Besides that it fit properly & did what it is suppose to do.
"I use this duffel to tote around my Tahitian costumes for shows, and it fits my full grass skirt set (rolled), and spider-plant hip band.  Plus there is tons more room for all my extra stuff (pareos, cocos, make-up, what-ever).  Fair warning that it has a very strong NEW smell to it when it arrives, but it went away after a few weeks of use.  It is very large, which I knew from the beginning, so I wouldn't use it for travel unless I *needed* to bring as much stuff as could fit in it."
They're comfortable but tighterthan I desired between? Knees and waist
It fits just as shown in the picture. Beautiful piece to wear with dresses
"Really cute. Fits great. Great material.
I received this at a free or reduced price for an honest and unbiased review."
"I am a good size 6 and the S fit well. I am 5'3"" and the skirt lands just at my ankles, wish it were a bit longer. The belt adds a nice touch but it does have a chemical scent that I hope goes away. Wear skin toned underwear and you'll not need a slip as it has many layers so you shouldn't need to add more material. This skirt would look good with a nice denim top, tied at the bottom, without the belt..add brown leather sandals and you've got a nice outfit. I really like the skirt!"
"I LOVE these socks. They are a bit on the thicker side so make sure you allow, but super comfortable and hold up well in the wash. I'm buying more!"
Fits a woman's small wrist; expansion bands are always too big for me and straps are  too much trouble. This also has easy to read numbers. Easy to get on and off. Perfect gift for an older person too who needs these features. I have bought this style for several years. I get about 18 months from it before the band begins to tear.
I was hoping a size 9 would fit me but too small. I got the size 10 and it fit great. Came VERY fast. Thanks. Last time I bought Crocs in 2008 was they were a size 10. I guess my feet did not shrink.
"Great price, but seems to be made of thinner materials (leather and rubber toe) than the true old-school versions."
"Excellent, my Brother loves this hoodie!"
Comfortable and stylish. Wish there were additional colors
"Granddaughter absolutely loved this box and necklace. Box is beautiful and metal- not cheap cardboard pr plastic. Worth every penny to see her face when she saw the box and then realized what was inside. Priceless!! The necklace is also great quality- heavy, sparkly, shiny, gorgeous!!
If you buy any LOTR jewlery- make it this . You will not be disappointed!"
Very  comfortable I like it
"This wallet is soft and nicely made.  Although it didn't stay that where it was made, you can feel that this is a well made product.  I have not used trifold before and need sometime to get use to.  Nevertheless, it gives me more room to store but just a bit bulky."
"We all have Casio solar watches. Our youngest son wanted and the rule is when you can tell time you can get a nice watch. So, when he learned he got one. He wears it everyday. The colors are nice. It fits nicely too."
"Pretty! I love rose gold anything, so I knew these would be perfect for me. They have a nice, realistic sparkle to them, and the rose gold metal combined with the champagne zirconia is lovely. I wish they were a teeny bit smaller, but overall, I'm very happy with these."
I run anywhere from 3 to 10 miles at a time and recently started wearing these shirts. I notice a significant increase in performance in this material after wearing cotton for so long and can't believe I didn't discover these sooner. I feel like I can breathe easier in these shirts. You really don't need the overpriced Nike and Under Armour. I just wish Amazon would stock more colors in the Small size. This offers outstanding value at the price point.
This is my husbands favorite work shirt it's very durable her is a farmer and works great for him
"It fits well on my feet and legs, and it looks cool. love it"
I took a star because there's no pockets. Everybody needs pockets these days.
Really nice booties.  They fit perfect and are comfortable. They look great on too.  Great service and good price.
"I really liked these bibs for my grandson.  They cover the whole front of him for feeding, burping, spitting up, drooling and are easy to put over his head and off without any irritating Velcro or snaps."
"I haven't worn this knitted snow cap yet, but the fit is good, and the hat is cute for cold weather - even covering my ears! I like the brim, as well."
Shoes seem a little tight. Nice looking. Hope the heel isn't too high for me.
"Great leather, sticks to the rings a bit due to differences in texture. Great looking, durable, and well finished. I have a special wide watch, and this really helped!"
This is a very nice luggage set! I bought them in blue but they have more of a purple hue to them. I still love them though.
Nice seemingly well made shoe. Very comfortable right out of the box. The only thing that would have got this shoe a 5 star rating from me is if it had a better non slip sole. A little water on a hard surface makes for a fall with these shoes if you are not paying attention to how you are walking. Otherwise a great shoe. Just got them so I will see how they will wear.
Good Product fit as expected.
"I ordered a small and I am 8 months pregnant and can still zip over my belly - so I would say this runs a little big. There were some strings already detached so the quality is not the best, but it is a really cute vest!"
"as many pairs of fitflops that i have and this is the first and only style of fitflop sandals that i can wear, as well as the only supercomff style. i'm glad i finally found these."
"LOVE, and it photographed really well!"
"Pretty embroidery! Would make a great beach cover up. Has a bit of a strong scent to it in the package, likely the dye. I'm happy with the fit."
"I basically was looking for corset for  long time, for something that you could wear in the office with blouse underneath. The material is soft with the plastic ribs inside to shape you up precisely

Highly recommend, I spent quite a bit of time looking for it and here it is"
This is a pricy carry-on but so worth it.  It's an easy fit under your seat if not stuffed.  It carried more than expected.
Nice blouse. It fits well unless it's a little tight on the upper -arm circumference.
I had issues with the width on my right foot. But breaking them in seem to resolve it.
beautiful and received fast
Obsessed with it!
Its a great boot but it was to small and had to return it.  They didn't have my size in a larger one.  shucks
Stretched around the neck after about 3-4 washes
Totally comfortable. These are my spring palazzo's with a tank and some cute sandals. Boom easy breezy
Very soft material and very thin also see through. Bought 3 but to wear  under another opened shirt.
Perfect and just the right size
It was perfect .my son loves it and I do too.very neat on him
"They are awesome pants, they DO NOT require to go up in size. They are slim fitting and amazing. At first they were too big but after washing them they shrunk and they're perfect. Thank you!!!"
Love the shawl as I wore it to a gala and received many compliments
Very nice shirt but too large.  I own many Woolrich shirts and love them all but I do find the brand tends to run large.
"This fits my 4 year old son just right. He is a tad bit taller than most kids his age, but the small was still good for him. The material is very lightweight, so for those in the cold weather states, you are should plan on using a sweatshirt under neath. With that said, the costume is just right on my tall skinny boy, but we are able to get a not-so thick sweatshirt on underneath."
"Very happy with this laptop bag, very nice quality and professional look, as well as holds all my papers. I did find that the inside wall, where you put your laptop, is beginning to rip after 6 months of use. Not that this is really a problem because the laptop still is held in place, but I feel like it should of held together for a longer period of time. Granted, I use it everyday."
"Feel very soft, the size is very large, the only thing I don't like is it's too thick. But I'll keep it"
"Nice comfortable, cozy socks."
"I bought the gold (blush) ones first. I liked them so much, I bought the silver ones.
I own several pair of yellow box flip flops. By far by favorite sandles. They come in a variety of styles and colors, and the are very comfortable."
Love this dress for my daughter's school uniform soft material fits great! Shipped on time!
I love the pattern and the feel.  It does make static if rubbed but that's not a big deal.
These shoes are awesome. I wore them under my wedding dress... And wore them until they fell apart. Really wish I could find them again.
"very good,i love it!"
"I was a little worried that this would be ""HUGE"" as so many people said.  It's maybe a tad large but not ridiculously so.  My son loves it.  The construction is quality and it's so cute.  The actual dimensions when folded are 4.5"" tall by 3.5 inches wide.  I see this as something he will have for years and wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
My granddaughter is true to size (she is 6 and wears a size 6).  The dress fitted her perfectly.
"These are really cute summer shoes when you don't want to wear flip flops. They are not too stripy, kind of muted, which is nice."
LOVE my new flips!  They are so comfy and look sporty&acute at the same time.
It is very warm and  stylish!
"My nine year old son just finished reading the Hobbit and had his heart set on being Bilbo for Halloween.  The wig arrived on time.  It is a curly wig though and fits nicely on my nine year olds head.  Some reviews mentioned that the ears are too high, however they seem fine to us.  A bit of my son's ears might show with movement, but it is fine for a child's costume.  I am not sure how it would work with an adult."
"Well when I ordered this product I was looking from my kindle. What I expected was a hoodie (which is also what the title entails). What I received was a jacket. Not a big fan of jackets because the zippers are always crud, and this one looks and feels like it will break after 5 zips. Oh well. Waited 3 weeks for the wrong product and I'll deal with it and maybe find a way to make it into an actual hoodie."
Too expensive. I did not see what was so special about the shoe to make them so expensive.
Cute for trick or treating with your littles
lightweight & they fit my big head. a rare occurrence.
Reefs. We lived in Florida and have tried all kinds of flip flops. These are by far the best. Simple and hold up beautifully. This is my husband's second pair. The first he had for 10 years. I've had mine for 14 years. They hold up and mold to you foot. The cloth band is very comfortable between your toes and over your foot. These are the best.
This is my second pair. Worth the extra $$$.
"Nice high quality, weighted smooth beads, GREAT price! Makes a great gift or a gift for yourself, I plan on buying some for myself real soon! Who wouldn't at this price!?"
Great Company! Love their products!!! They are wonderful :)Very Happy :) I already have this product at home and buying it for a friend :)
SO FUN!  Fit my boyfriend and he has a big head.  Put some birthday pins on it and he had a blast wearing it around.
"When I ordered this top I was concerned that it may be a little too low in front. After and trying it on I found that was not the case. I love the feel and fit. Anyone thinking of ordering this should know that this top has that ""ruched"" look, so there will be more fabric around the abdomen and hips. I have seen reviews where it's been pulled all the way down and worn as a dress!"
Given as a Christmas to one of my sons.  Much appreciated.
"very comfortable, good arch support, and good looking.  highly recommended"
"She loved them! After my friend wore them, she decided the next size up would be better. So, I ordered 2 more larger pair."
"have to buy more ,...perfect fit,...my wife loves me in this shirt !!."
Beautiful hat. Got a lot of compliments. Love it. Wish you have more deep colors for me to choose.
"Surprisingly nice shoes for the price! They are extremely comfortable but the other reviews are right, better order them in advance of the event you want them for.  They smell so much like glue and hot plastic they give an instant headache.  You will need at least a week to air them out!"
This was a gift for my granddaughter.  She was thrilled with it.  She loves the color and the polka dots.  The matching headband adds to the outfit.
"I really loved these when I first got them.  After wearing them for only a few hours, however, they hurt my feet.  Too narrow and the pressure points were terrible.  Cute as can be but most uncomfortable.  :("
Cute and stylish and comfortable. They fit true to size. I suggest you go a shoe/department store and try on White Mountain shoes/boots to find your size. I have bought several White Mountain boots on Amazon and love them all.
"My husband needed a watch that keeps the time to within a second a month and this one fit the bill. Very sturdy too. We did have a problem with the first watch we ordered, it would not keep proper time at all, but Amazon came through perfectly on the return process even though this purchase involved a ""third party"" vendor. 5 Stars for Amazon too!"
I love cool and interesting socks and these are both.
"Took a long time to get it, but worth the wait. My son loves it."
Excellent look. Very substantial for a very inexpensive price.
It's very warm for its thickness. Runs a bit small but I could still fit it on my head. Great for running.
Comfy and well made. Very happy with this purchase!
"So ""cool"" wearing this Serenity Prayer dog tag!
It's rugged and refined.  Laser marking.
Slight blemishes make each one unique.
Very affordable."
"Love these socks!!  Super comfortable.  I have wide feet, and they fit great."
These socks fit well and provide very good comfort. I wear these to work everyday and can definitely feel the difference around my ankles and shins. I would recommend this to others and would buy again when needed.
I have a drop foot an the toe on these shoe are flat with the sole. I kept stubing my foot.
Great color & fit.  :)
"I ordered an 18/20 for my daughter who is 5'10"" and a size 14.  It was perfect.  It hit mid-calf and was very slimming on the sides."
"Very comfortable and flattering. I am 5""2 and 7 1/2 months pregnant. As you can imagine I'm wide lol and the black is very slimming. Packaging did smell smoky as other reviewers have stated, but nonetheless well worth the purchase."
"the texture is pretty much as i expected them to be
soft and comfy"
I love this! Vertical lines are so slimming!
"This was a super cute costume, but ran a little small. We bought the 6-12 month. My daughter was 8 months old and very small for her age and it was still snug. The head piece was almost too big, though, and her head circumference is in the 61st percentile. So, the sizing was a little off, but she still was able to wear it. It is cuter in person than in the pic. The wrist/ankle pieces are tight. I recommend not leaving them on for very long."
Fits perfect with some whose lost their hair due to chemotherapy.
"Wore to my college commencement ceremony, simple and clean.  Not top quality, but good for the price.  Satisfied."
Beautiful piece. Shipped much faster than the estimate. Changes color depending on angle and type of lighting.
Great Cape and Crown.  We used it with the minions costume for Bob.  Here's my daughter as KING BOB!
"I've been trying to find a bra to  give me the coverage I need, but still had a little bit of style.  It's hard for a 36DD to find both those things, but this is it!  Very comfortable, and keeps me where I need to be.  I will be buying more!"
Fits as expected and the material is so comfortable
"I'm a long time fan of Haggar. All 4 pairs of slacks fit perfectly, and the quality is great."
"Comfortable and seems fine for the gym. I do mostly cardio equipment, and I'm not certain how better a more expensive shoe would be, but I'm happy with the comfort, price, and fit. My shoe size is 13, and these fit as expected."
Great. Hat. Was crushed in the shipping still trying to get the broom straightened out it's very light weight and very colorful nice product
"Anything by Pearl Izumi is fantastic.  I used to work in bicycle shops and got great discounts on Pearlie stuff.  I became an addict to this high-end brand.  Pearl Izumi makes the best  and you can't go wrong with them.  The hard part is which item to choose.  Though I am a lady, I always prefer the Men's mediums as they fit perfectly.  (I have larger hands from years of piano and basketball.)

When we ride on the road on our roadbikes, over 1/3 of our weight goes through our arms and into our hands.  So I wanted a glove that replaced my last pair of gel Pearies that finally fell apart after nearly ten years.  These are better.

They have the gel and padding in all the right places and its as if I designed them for myself.  They are breathable and lightweight and the open fingers make riding the road so much more comfy.  There have been a couple of times where I've forgotten my gloves and paid dearly for it.

(I did NOT get paid by Pearl Izumi though I think I should have, lol.  I sing their praises every day.)"
Fades after a few washes. But still looks black...shrinks to what I believe is the proper size..unwashed they seem big..cargo pockets need to be ironed but only takes a few min to steam out any problem areas..
"I purchased the black ""spinner"" version of this luggage. The quality is great and it is indeed light (just 8.6 lbs, while the rollaboard version (i.e., (non-spinner is even lighter at 7.6lbs). You just have to compare the weight and quality at its price point with the competition and you will see that it blows them away. I actually compared several brands at the local department store. By the way, this luggage (in black) looks just like what you see pilots and flight stewardess carrying on board aircraft. That's perhaps why Travelpro holds itself out to be ""the choice of flight crews (and frequent travelers."")

I am happy that I found great value by finding a great quality product at a good price.

Update as of July 2013:
After using the luggage for awhile, I can say that I would definitely prefer the 2 wheels rather than four for the following reasons:

a) It is difficult to keep a 4 wheeler stationary in one spot. On any surface that is slightly curved, it will automatically slide to the lowest point and this is frustrating especially if you just want it to stay put.
b) I find it easier to drag a two wheeler than to slide a four wheeler.
c) The 2 wheeler is 7.4 lbs vs 8.6 lbs for the 4 wheeler
d) I can't justify a higher price for the 4 wheels based on a) b) and c) above."
"Well, my old Adidas duffel that I've had for 20+ years finally gave out and I needed a new bag. I researched for a good bit and knew I didn't need anything especially large. I mainly wanted something that could hold all of my running gear, to keep it all in one place, and be easy to grab on the way out of the door. This bag fits the bill perfectly.

The shoe compartment is actually a tunnel that runs through the main compartment of the bag. I was expecting just a large side pocket, and the tunnel does take up some space within the bag. Even with that, though, I was able to fit a ton of stuff in the bag with room to spare.

It has another large side pocket that is perfect for gels, headbands, whatever other items you may have.  It would've been great had this pocket had a divider so that I could separate things a bit more. The bag is soft and does not have a stability insert for the bottom. I happen to like this, as I prefer my bag to mold to me a bit and not be too stiff. This bag molds great and is easy to carry.

I gave this bag 4 stars as the material feels sort of cheap. One other reviewer compared it to a reusable shopping bag, and I would say it feels about the same. However, my reusable shopping bags have taken a lot of wear, so who knows. I doubt this bag will last the 20 years my last one did, but overall, it is functional, form fitting, holds a ton and is very nice looking."
"Super roomy and good quality canvas for the not-so-girly girl. Fits my large wallet, kindle, a jacket, my phone, keys, glasses and a variety of small toiletries. Love!"
Very nice men's robe and soft. Fit perfectly but I'm not sure it would fit a heavier man. Nice blue color.
Super cute! My sister-in-law isn't a fan of pink so I got the red version for my niece. It's more of a fall coat as it does not have a thick lining. The material seems water resistant and would make a great rain coat! It seems well constructed and I can't wait to see my niece in it.
Comfy! Just ordered another in a different color . . .
"Very good Quality ,.. very comfortable ...."
Still wearing them today!
"nice shirt
sleeves could be longer a little"
Shoe fits fine as expected. My only complaint and it's directed at the manufacture. I have a black pair of these from some odd years ago. Those have more padding in and around the show opening and a softer leather compared to the newer versions. Must be cost cutting methods. See my photos to compare old vs new.
This hat is super cute for babies/kiddos. Ours looks super cute with his camo!
"I was so happy to get this necklace. I have been wanting to become Wiccan for a long while and I got this as a reminder... and I love it. It came timely and it looked exactly like the picture. It can be adjusted, it goes with any and everything and it's a symbol for a Wiccan's belief system. I love how the brooms are making the Pentagram and the flower in the middle is gorgeous as well. Get it! You'll love it."
Love these sleepers
"I purchased this ring as a wedding band for my fianc, who works with his hands and was reluctant to have something like sliver or gold.  He loves this ring so much he's refused to take it off and we still have a month before the wedding!!!"
"Did not expect these to fit because I hVe trouble finding a good pair of jeans, but hey fit perfectly! I'm 5' 10"" and weigh 120, I usually wear a size 1 or 3 and bought a size 3 because people said they run small.
Most jeans show a little bit of my ankle (I have long legs) and it is so annoying but these didn't!
These also aren't thin or flimsy jeans, so I think I will have them for a long time!"
Very comfortable. No movement restriction. A bit tricky to remove until you catch on how to do it. Good quality fabric. Reasonable cost.
"Nice colors, good quality. Fits as I expected. It was a good purchase."
Sheer nostalgia.... Picked it up for it and it's always been a conversation starter.
"It looks a littlebig on me, i have a small face. Looked great on my Girlfriend. So if you have a smallface it looks big/funny"
"These are absolutely lovely earrings.  Now I want a white pair, and a gray pair....."
Super cute. Great for spring
"Perfect, travelled all over Europe and didn't have any problems with TSA"
"They're great for running and my daughter loves them, except that several other girls at her school have them.  Fashion no-no!"
"High quality and very well made...this is an amazing hat!  If you like style and wants lots of attention...this is the hat for you.  It travels well and can be rolled up and packed in a bag, taken out, and quickly bounces back into shape!  Fantastic sun protection (for a hat) and I get compliments on it everywhere I wear it.  For those with a creative flair, it is easy to customize with ribbons, flowers, tulle........whatever you like.  I recommend sewing a small comb or two inside the rim to hold it in place on your head.  A scarf, elastic strap, or ribbon can also be sewn on if you plan to wear it outdoors because it can catch a breeze and you won't want to lose it."
very well made and right compact size to keep everything secure
Super cute! Can't wait to use it!
theyre cute.
Stylish but the quality is OK The fabric is on the thinner side Curious to see it after few washes
These boots are awesome.  They do run a little big so I downsized half a size and they fit perfect.  Very comfortable boots and look great.
I bought 3 pair before they sold out I love all of them. I will be checking to see what else they have
"The back is a bit low so if you wear a bra with it, it will be hanging out. Very very soft material though, so its comfy w/o a bra"
I like my savanne slacks very much.  The pants fit and wear very good it is unbelieveable how comfortable they wear.  I am glad that I ordered them from Amazon.com because the price was great and no shipping and taxes were paid.
She like the style
Excellent in every way.
"This gift was for my grandnephew, my niece love it.  Gerber is a great quality baby clothing line."
This is a great looking shirt but the size was just to big for my 61 frame. Maybe I can grow into it?
"well made, great quality and fast service."
These fit me perfectly and the colors were just the right variety for me.
"Bought these shirts because regular tee shirts were always too short. The size is pretty close to what I'm, used to in other tee shirts except they're about 3"" longer.
The quality seems fine. They've been through numerous washings and are still in good shape. I'll definitely be buying more of these shirts."
These are my favorite pants. Very comfortable but may be a little to baggy for some people.
Love the colors.  Reminds me of my old hippy days.
Shirt is comfy. My daughter wears it all the time now.
"For many years I have worn only white socks during the summer.  However, I recently decided that light khaki color would go well with the khaki pants I wear during the warm season.  Having already gotten a heavier set of Dockers socks which were very satisfactory for winter wear, I decided to try these and was pleasantly surprised.  They fit well and stay up about as well as any socks I have owned.  If you like over-the-calf socks and find the color suits your wardrobe I believe you will like these."
I loved these pair of jeans. They fit perfectly and they feel so soft.
This dress is THE DRESS! I wore it on my birthday. I posted some pictures on FB. I got many compliments. It's sexy and well made. Highly recommended!
Fits great a
"Love the material, very comfortable."
"Loved the color, the sparkle around the face of the watch.  Very durable and use it every day. I'm pretty hard on my watches and when I wear this at school I don't even worry about my watch taking a beating."
Looks great. Fits well. No complaints from me or my other half. :)
"I Wish I had saw this earlier, I just paid $350.00 for this watch as a Christmas gift from some place else, you guys are getting a great deal."
"Received my new lenses today for my original Twenty X (XX) frames that I bought in 2001.  I was skeptical when ordering them, but the price was fair and there were good reviews.  The lenses are excellent, packaging was very nice (a little 2 pouch bag to keep the lenses separated), and they look nice.  The fit is snug and you have to put them in ""just right"" or they won't fit, but that's a good thing.  Original Oakley lenses aren't quite as snug but I don't see any problems with popping out and swapping lenses now that I know these run snug and I know how to put them in properly (outside edge in first, then snap the inside edge in).  5 stars and I WILL order other lenses.  I have polarized red and polarized black lenses from Walleva now, and I don't think I'll be ordering original Oakley lenses again.  That is... unless these don't last.  But I'm in Kuwait in the summer and outside A LOT, so if they're gonna fail, they'll fail here and I'll change my review."
"I live in Lee's and Dockers.  Wish they would come in more colors.  Jeans are too hot for the desert, Lee's are perfect."
Beautiful ring! I couldn't get a photo to give it the justice it deserves!
"This is very sexy. It fit well, but the straps were so long and that made it too revealing in front--I had to keep my jacket on to stay covered. It is stretchy, so maybe if I had gotten a smaller size the straps/chest coverage wouldn't be an issue...I can't say for sure. I'm 5'4"", ~145 lbs and 36DD."
looks great and warm perfect for winter my daughter loves it
"Fits perfectly! I will order another one soon. Nice, simple, but cute and classy dress that can be dressed up or down, any season."
One of my personal favorites to see my wife in.
These run a little big. Wish the lrv part was a little taller. These fall off way to easily. They are cute though.
"My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and it fits her great, the pedals on the hood are so cute when you position them to stand up around her face! I like the clips to close around her wrists, there's tons of room if she's wearing a bigger coat underneath to fit in the openings as well."
"Love this shirt, but like half the tshirts I try on it's too long. Fits great in a medium at the shoulders for me (5'9"" 165lbs, some muscle) but it goes all the way past my butt."
Love the style and fit of these.
"you NEVER go wrong with CARHARTT  items

NSS"
"Quality time piece, love the light recharging system."
This necklace came a couple of weeks early.  It is a nice length chain. Looks exactly as pictured. I have wore it a few times with it being summer it matches a few of my outfits perfectly. The only problem I have is I have to keep adjusting the infinity symbol and the anchor. the anchor  is heavier and pulls the chain on that side down so it has to be adjusted every so often. It is worth the wait and the price can't be beat. So far no tarnishing.
"I have tried all sorts if compression gloves. These seem to be the best at consistently providing pressure and not stretching out. I give it 4 stars for two reasons: they tend to snag easily and the only color is tan (isotoner should come up with some other colors - I'm young, variety would certainly cheer the soul a bit when you're not feeling well)"
I LOVE LOVE LOVE these slippers and will buy them again!
Just what I was looking for!!  Can't go wrong with a pair of rayban wayfarers--and polarized at that!
"Long underwear can be bizarrely expensive. The Duofold Heavy Weights are cheaper than many competitors that are out there, and you might be asking yourself if there's something substandard or deficient with this long underwear. I assure you that this is a high-quality product.

I purchased this long underwear for use in Afghanistan, where the winters can be brutal. We didn't have a lot of heat, and I depended on this long underwear. It stands up to rigorous use; it breathes; it's undeniably warm; and, it's comfortable. I'm back home now, but I'm hanging onto this long underwear, and I expect it to last for many years to come for wintertime hiking."
"Nice, smallish wallet for credit cards and cash.  It says it's for men, but it looks great with my black purse, and holds everything I need.  I'm trying to cut down on the big, bulky stuff, and carry just what I need, and this fits perfectly in one of the inner pockets of my purse.  What I have been using was one of those plastic ""compacts"", whose inside pockets are breaking, allowing cards to fall out.  So, problem solved.  I'm going back to the conventional way to carry cards - this is exactly what I needed!  Good-looking, too!"
"This is great quality in every way! Its so hard to find tall sizes. Fantastic fit, and so soft and comfortable! I WILL be ordering more!"
"The cups are a tad small for my breast shape, but I still like the bra."
"I fiddle with this constantly at work, glad it can handle it"
"Fruit of the Loom - You can't go wrong. These fit perfect, are very comfortable and provide the expected results for a woven boxer. For the price, these are ideal - and the size is just right. I would recommend for other gentlemen that want comfort and use."
"Very light, easy to wear.  Look great.  Quality construction.  Only criticism would be sole is a bit more like harder plastic than soft rubber.  Still very, very satisfied and would buy again."
"I bought for my daughter.  It is very soft and not itchy.
Would recommend!"
Already had these shoes in red and have now added black. They are true to size and I feel safe in them. Had a broken femur and need to be careful due to osteo and these work well for me. They also look very cool with workout clothes. I also like them because your feet can breathe in them.
"THIS HAT.. IS JUST ASJKDHLASIDH PERFECT
GAISSS YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!
IT'S JUST LIKE IN POKEMON ^~^ <3 <3 <3"
I've tried similar products. These are my favorite. Easy to put on and use.
My husband loves these shoes. They fit great and look great.
"a little long, but the waist seems just right"
"Great to use for meditation practice.  Very warm, heavy and well made. A++++ seller"
Very Comfortable for all day wear...shipped to me extremely quickly.  I am very pleased.
"A warning to all: if you're not use to walking on 4"" heels or higher on a regular basis, this is not your shoe!...no matter how sexy they look.  I own the the black with tan bow vamp, size 7.5 medium and the fit is perfection.  These pumps are not meant for all-night dancing or running down the block but I do have the skill set to walk comfortably on them.  I placed silicone front pads (sold on this site) to extend my walking comfort.  The shoe itself looks exactly as sexy as in the photo and the adjustable ankle straps are quite comfortable.  But the soles are stiff with no give...no problem for me.  The issue I have with these pumps is the leather components were not as nice as in quality or texture for the minimal amount used, and I expected a fairly higher grade (since this is the normal retail price).  But if you're only concern is to have your legs look slender, lean and sassy...Grab it and you'll get tons of complements like I did.  A must buy!"
pretty nice shirt.
"They are warm but not as warm as advertised.  I bought these for mountaineering.  For when at base camp.  At 17,500 feet, they are warm but not that warm. The price is great and they are comfortable but they pile and are NOT for minus 20.  Best for 30 degrees at the lowest but best at 45 and up."
This is now one of my favorite summer shirts. It can be worn for dressy or casual and is very comfortable while in the hot sun. The blouse is well constructed and of high quality gauze for a reasonable price.
The shirt fit as expected and is super soft. I ordered the orchid one and it is a very pretty color. I was able to find more things in my closet to match this up with than I thought. Definitely recommend.
I have to carry around a lot do files for my job. I've been looking for a stylish bag that would get that done. This bag is perfect. The straps are long enough I can just reach in it is durable. I get compliment on this all the time.
"good product, only a little thick that I expect, good price"
Size fits slightly small (XL fits like Large) but material quality is good
Great performance socks!
"I love this bra! Comfortable, supportive, and sexy!  Will buy again."
"Awesome shorts, well constructed. Took a couple weeks to arrive, but they did come from China..."
Bought for my husband he likes it and gets a lot of compliments
I have bought several of these suits and they all fit and look great. Well made and at a great price.
"No frills, black, fits well and is very well made.  I like it.  I use it for my regular, small, original Kindle, for which it's a little big, but it works great.  Highly recommended."
It was perfect for our cowboy and Indian themed party for a husband who didn't want to dress up.
"There is no better belt and the price is great. My pants do not move any longer when I walk. For years I had to constantly pull up my pants but those days are over!! Unbelievable fit to the millimeter. So comfortable, easy to use, and excellent quality. This is the real deal. Stop looking, stop browsing, but this belt you will love it and will never buy another type of belt again."
"I bought these for my wife as she has to be careful what types of shoes she wears because of a bad knee, She loves her Vionics!"
"These shirts are inexpensive and are not of super high quality. However, they are so lovely over a bathing suit or over a tank top with a pair of jeans. I went back and ordered it in white as well. I always get compliments when I wear it, but I definitely recommend hand washing, I don't think it would hold up long with machine washing."
"A very pretty dress, and who doesn't look amazing in blush-pink? But, my experience was that it is not too big, as other reviewers said -I ordered a Medium for my size Large body, but the hips just wouldn't fit, so it had to be returned."
Beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!! Better than I expected!
They are tight but that is what I expect from an undershirt. They are also thin which is good. I don't expect them to last more than a few years but they are cheap and do the job.
"These are not shoes, but Amazon seems to think they are. I got this for my wife and she LOVES it. It's her new everyday purses. It holds the essentials."
Had to return the pants - ran too small...also had a funny smell.  But the return was quick & easy!
"Beautifully made wallet, great price and very quick delivered."
"Cotton is really soft and breathes well. I like wearing this shirt on road runs, because I dodge imaginary zombies and feel like a real BAMF. Bring it on Zeds... I'm gonna be ready!"
Gift for my son.  Loved it.
"I'm an extra large long and this sweater fits perfectly.  The problem I have with most shirts and sweaters is that they are not long enough, but this one fits perfectly."
"LOVE this skirt, overall.  It fit me well, I followed the size chart, and the material seems to be good quality.  It did ride up on me unfortunately which meant I had to keep pulling it down, but I think this is due to the stretchy material."
"Great product, excellent condition."
Wife loves them.  They are very stylish and the subtle animal print is very cool.  Very comfortable and wearable all day.  Can't go wrong.
I love my boots.  The only issue I had with these boots is the stitching at the top rubbed on my legs quite a bit at first but now the stitching has worn down so it does not bother me at all.
Very well made and strong. Definitely I recommend it.
"I wasn't sure to order a medium or large. I usually wear a size 8-10, 36dd, 5'8. I decided to go with the large and it fits perfect!!! I will probably order more colors ( I got the red)"
"I bought a few other dresses along with this and frankly although there were good reviews my overall expectation for the dress were low. But surprise, surprise the quality of the fabric was quite decent and the fit was perfect."
High quality!! Very nice!!
"Great bag, can't beat the price."
"I bought 3 pairs of these trousers in 3 different sizes ( XL, 3XL and 4XL) for my younger brother, best friend and myself. We love them!!!  They are almost like the trousers I was issued in the Marine Corps. They are very well made.  If you decide to buy these......make sure you measure your waist.....the sizing to a little different since they come from Great Britain. I have recommended these to all my Marine buddies."
"Perfect! Despite the fact that I don't like ordering bras online, I was getting desperate and decided to take a chance. After weeks of trying on store bras and having all of them be uncomfortable or too small, I was ready to give up. I'm a
38D so trying to find a D cup with any padding really was quickly becoming a nightmare - apparently most companies just assume that D cups don't wear push ups but whatever.
I was cautiously optimistic when it arrived, but I'm so glad I took the chance! It's super comfortable with some padding, but not a ridiculous amount. This may sound a little weird, but the band felt super soft - I have really sensitive skin, so some bra bands feel really scratchy and irrating, but this one actually felt super nice. The only thing I could possibly complain about is that the color is slightly darker than it is in the pictures, but I had the same problem with my camera, so I just shrugged it off.
Probably going to end up buying more colors in the future"
I loved them but had to return; ordered one half size up.
"These get hard use in a desert environment, and with terrible-quality water (extremely salty water) for washing, and they hold up extremely well. I especially like the exterior pockets -- they hold a lot and don't rub against your leg. Highly recommended."
"I love this petticoat. I bought it to wear under a 50's vintage dress and it brought the dress to life! The only thing I would like to add is that it runs big.. a full size larger than most US brands. I initially ordered a large , I am 5'7 and 165 lbs. I usually wear a size 8-10 in clothing. This petticoat was to big in the waist. I reordered a size small and it fit as if it were a medium, which was perfect for me."
my wife liked this T-shirt fits her well
"These are really nice jeans.  Nice and thick, well made, very cute looking.  I ordered a size six for my 6 year old and they are a bit longer than his other sixes.  He will grow into them though."
"Often invaded company Casio world of products and models, is flooded each eye and hit all heard!
Economic well-known products from cheap to very expensive and with the amazing features, and versatility is hard to describe, and this product is a venerable brand creations,& This product is especially for those who prefer the size of the average and suit them ,Each Casio products against water and water-resistant fully real, competitive price Amazon prices compared with other vendors and good customer service and shipping distinctive"
Great price for this
love Rockports  was looking for a casual pair to replace the ones they don't make anymore..  Unfortunately my husbands feet are slender and long and these were too wide for him without lacing them too tightly.
"Daughter says that they're soft and comfy.  I'll take her word for it, since as a guy I don't tend to wear socks like these.  :-)"
"I've worn these for several years.  They are very light and cute.  I often get comments.  The straps keep them from slipping.  The arch is perfect for medium arch need, not too much and not flat.  They tolerate getting wet perfectly.  I've worn them into the lake to get the dog and had zero problems with fit or appearance afterward.  The soles are grippy but don't make you trip.  They have a nice spring and cushion.  I have these shoes in at least 5 colors and have been buying them for several years in slightly different styles as Teva evolves them.  Ordered a 9.  Fit is precisely a true 9. If you need 9.25, if there were such a thing, then get the 9.5.  If you wear a 8.75, as in almost a 9, the 9 will probably fit. Very flexible."
Bought this for my one year old. It was thigh length for the age. I'll just save them for a later date.
I seem to recall some reviewer saying the fabric was poor quality. The jeans I received are very nice smooth cotton and a medium weight so they can be worn all year in BC where I live.
"High quality, adorable coat. It's slightly large, but not so much that it's a problem."
lens size is perfect - not like those oversized aviator glasses. This is much classier.
Lovely jacket! I knew it would run small so I ordered it 2 sizes up. Fits fine!
"A little small or I had to much lunch, either way it was cute, just as pictured. Paired it with a half shirt and looked great with jeans and boots for a costume party."
Love to pair it with cropped pants or shorts. It's something out of the ordinary. A conversation started. Great colors and works with a lot of outfits.
Very comfortable and have resisted wearing out. Great purchase for the price.
"Perfect fit! Very breathable, dries very fast. Would buy again!"
"we love it, it fits great. just what he wanted"
"I had this bag in my shopping cart for months!  I just couldn't make up my mind.  It just looked practical and different.  My big concern was the notes people had made about how short it is when worn across the body.  As a chubby lady thought this might be an issue.

I finally bit the bullet and bought it and I'm glad I did!  I find the crossbody fit to be pretty comfortable - though I've been losing a lot of weight so it's been fitting better and better.  I'm 5'4"" and wear a size 16 pants and it crosses over my body to rest right above and on my hip.  I find that works just fine for me.  People also commented that the strap is wide, which is true.  But I haven't found it to be uncomfortable even with stiff felt.

It had never occurred to me until I read another review on here about how having a bright liner made things easier to find inside.  *Forehead slap* I can't believe I'd never thought of that, seriously!  I had just thought the contrast with the dark grey and light blue looked cool but it even serves a good purpose!  I rarely carry my ipad around but the padded area in the middle holds it well and is lightly padded.  I do manage to get a lot of stuff in there and can even zip the top. I usually carry:  a small umbrella, a water bottle, a big billfold, a portable charger, snack bar, small emergency bag with earplugs, benadryl, aspirin, eyedrops, alcohol wipes..yes I'm that person.

I never use the buttoned part of the bag.  I wish the buttons were decorative and there was a metallic closure because it's a little tedious to have to undo each button. I've considered altering it myself to do this but I'll probably never get around to it. It is fairly easy to unbutton with the flexible felt though.  I spilled some coffee on it a few weeks ago and didn't notice for a few weeks.  It dabbed right off with a wet cloth.  I'm probably going to spray it with some scotch guard just in case.

To sum up, I'm really glad I bought this bag!  It's cute and holds a lot of stuff.  And I've gotten some nice compliments on it."
My 10-year old son wore this bow tie to a school dance. I ordered the adult size and it fit perfectly!
"i love boots and i love jessica simpsons shoes.  These boots are great!  no giant gap like others explained, at least not with the pair I received.  They'll be perfect to wear over leggings and jeans and even dresses.  I got the burgundy and the color is rich.  If you're looking for a nice boot that will last, i would definitely recommend this one!"
Great lightweight rain boots.  Soft and comfy.  Highly recommend!
Super cute & very comfortablr
"Wish it came in 3/4 sleeve. Love the color, cut, breeze, it is lovely."
"The style and the functionability is fabulous! The only concern I have is it does not look made very well. It is very stiff. I am afraid that after a few months of wear and using all the fuctionability it comes with, it just might start to come apart at the glued together seams. I think if the seams were stiched together, it would be a perfect wallet especially for the price!"
"We were looking for a shoe horn for several reasons. 1) Hiking boots purchased for my husband were not very flexible, backside of them would fold down when he tried to get his foot in. Once he got his foot in, the boots fit perfect. 2) Ski boots are always a struggle, someone suggested getting a shoe horn for this reason. 3) My husband was having surgery and would not be able to fully bend down for several weeks. He would need help getting his shoes/boots on. Searched on Amazon and found this. This shoe horn has been amazing for all 3 of the reasons we wanted one. It is very well made and thick. Does not bend, so it is perfect for getting feet into ski boots, and stiff shoes/boots of any kind. If you are older, having surgery, or have any kind of issue that makes it difficult to put your shoes on, this shoe horn has a great length and the solid stiff design prevents it from flexing as you use it. Now my husband can get his feet into his boots without issue, my kids get their feet into their ski boots without complaint, and my husband doesn't have to bend too far to get his shoes on now that he is healing from his abdominal surgery. We are VERY happy with this purchase, and highly recommend this item to anyone looking. Also, this company has been fantastic with communication. I heard from them upon placing my order, upon shipping, and after delivery to see if we were happy with our product. Can't beat that."
I got the med tall and guess I did not need to. I am 5 ' 9  and the tall is a couple of inches too long.  I love them otherwise.
I wear women's size 9 and medium fits well. They're very comfortable during the colder months in the south. Liked them so much I ordered several pair.
Best nose rings and deal I've gotten off amazon
Loves these shoes. Wear them all the time and continue to get compliments on how wellthey look on my feet.
"My new watch is all that I hoped for attractive functional and it has received nothing but positive comments

NOW I have a question for you ?? I buy one watch and then you bombard me almost daily to buy a watch. How many arms do you think I have ??????"
Super cute and comfy! I wore them to a party and was able to walk around and dance for over 4 hours.
Cute sandals but they run a bit on the small side.
"Perfect!!! I lost the last of my internally threaded snap in posts that I purchased in a specialty store out of state so I ordered these because I was in a pinch. They are perfect. The length is great, and the colors are a pretty good assortment."
Great fit for now but runs a little small. I was trying to get the right size for my daughter for fall weather and purchased a size 18 months which fits her perfect now but it's too hot to wear now. Will need in bigger size. Will purchase in 24mon
comfortable and hard wearing and get better with age
look sexy while looking your age.
nice sun glasses like the design very clear lenses and good protection from the sun.
"I own a few pr of running shoes and fell in love w a pr of Asics Gel Phoenix 4. They had the right combination of cushioning and support that I liked running on pavement. I wanted to step up to the Phoenix 5 but couldn't fin d my size. I read a review that talked about the Exalt being akin to the Phoenix. I ordered them and I'm glad I did. The cushioning w a more secure over lay that holds my foot better than the Phoenix, is exceptional. They give me that spring through my calf that really helps with my form when I'm getting tired..The shoe is off set just enough, slightly lower in the heel, that helps with my landing transition. Great shoe! My Exalt, Brooks Ghost 6 and Asics gel Nimbus 15 I alternate on my runs( 10-20 miles per week) and the Exalt and Ghost are the two favorites. The Ghost 6 is suppose to be a neutral shoe but the inner foot foam build up gives me more of a stability feel, where the Exalt, also a neutral shoe, gives me not as much in the arch but has great control. I wear a 10.5 in regular work shoe and ordered the 11.0. The 11 is best, giving me a finger of room up front for a better feel. The 10.5 would have been too small."
I'm 42/DDD plus size.  I purchased 3.  This bra fits really well and no wires!  Also gives the support I NEED.  I've gotten to the point I can't stand under wires.  It's pretty too.  The lavender is more a blue.  Not two tone like the picture.  The soaring blue is a light turquoise.  When will the manufactures sell matching panties with all bras? lol
Great for the price. Grandson wore it all day on the 25th!
Purchased these because of the great reviews and was not disappointed! My husband had  been searching for a durable and comfortable pair of boots to wear while snow blowing and shoveling that would keep his feet warm and dry. He's pretty picky and had tried much more expensive Uggs and other brands. Then decided on  these. These were 1/4 of the price...much nicer and more comfortable. He wears an 11 1/2 and ordered a 12. They fit perfectly.
Just in time for my hubby's parents Anniversary!! Thank you for the dress it's beautiful!! I recommend for any special occasion!!
Wore these for the Iron Girl and loved the material and the compression.  Nice price and nice produce for anyone needing an XL.
"Very pretty, not too large a center stone and looks nice on my hand."
"This costume is fantastic, I have to say. It wears well, and it does so for a good price. I was initially skeptical of buying this costume when originally shopping for a good Spider-Man costume. So, I read the reviews, weighed the pros and the cons, and looked at customer photographs before deciding to go for it. I have not been disappointed.

I originally ordered this costume in, I think, October of 2016. Now, a year later, I am still enjoying the costume. I wore it to the Spider-Man: Homecoming premiere, and fans and friends alike enjoyed it! I also more recently wore it to a local community center play day for the kids. They enjoyed it immensely. And, as it comes to kids, I found myself doing all kinds of acrobatic things. I did hand stands, cartwheels, splits, and plenty of running around, and the costume has held up. And, at the premiere, I jumped onto things and off things (within good reason), and never had any issues with the suit. Definitely a win-win.

Now, as others have said, the costume does have a red mesh where the nose and mouth are. And if someone is up close and personal, they will possibly be able to see your mouth and nose. It does, however, making breathing a bit easier, and doesn't detract from the overall appearance of the costume. And if you were to stand a few feet back, you can hardly notice it. The mesh for the eyes isn't the easiest thing to see out of, but it's not exceedingly impossible. In the daytime, anyhow. At nighttime, I probably wouldn't really attempt to walk around with the mask zipped up without a bit of help. Overall, not a deal breaker.

I should probably also add that wearing an undergarment beneath your costume is probably a very good idea. I've stuck with a pair of compression shorts that aren't really visible and work well with the suit.

One last thing regarding size-- we're probably all wondering ""will it fit me""? Having ordered another super hero suit, I found that the other suit was appropriately slim-fitting, but still a touch baggy in the waist area. So, I went with a smaller size. As a guy who is 5'6.25"" and 122 lbs, and who generally falls more into the large size category for a suit like this, I bought a medium instead. The medium is appropriately snug, but still allows for plenty of movement, and fits a bit better than my other super hero costume.

All in all, if you're looking for a cheaper cosplay outfit or something to wear for Halloween or to conventions or birthday parties and events, this is definitely worth a buy. Perhaps not so much if you're looking for absolute screen-accuracy, but it definitely feels like you're stepping right out of the comic books the moment you put it on. Of course, the brighter colors probably help with that, and wonderfully so!"
My granddaughter is still traumatized. Everyone else had a good laugh. Sweater itself is very good quality.
Great gift marked as from the Godchild. Pics of Godmother in her shirt with baby in his Godchild shirt will be put in the Godmother frame>
Great hat.  Look forward to using on the boat this summer.
"Love them,they were exactly what I wanted"
"I love all my fit flops. This one has a toe strap that wraps around your big toe, ok, with that said, if you have or have had bunions skip this sandal, as your big toe angles outward this toe strap pushes back as if your toe is pointing straight ahead, and you will be ready to take these off in 2 hrs if even that.  I had foot surgery on my left foot long ago and do notice that my left toe becomes sore after about 4 hrs in this sandal, but I still love this shoe for all of its other comfort.  The size 9 does seem to be a bit longer and my toes don't come to the edge of the sandal, great if your a 9-1/2. Even so I like the look wearing it and it is the great FitFlop sole."
"This bag is actually beige, but it was still very cute and I used it for about a year."
This item was as described and perfect. However; it runs small.
"Love these. This colour was a steal.. Hoping at some point the black also goes on sale! (Wishful thinking)
These seem ever so slightly wider than the bone colour I bought elsewhere. But, they are equally very well made and will last for years to come. Highly recommended."
very satisfied with product!
"I love this shoe, very comfortable wear. Excellent finish even to the details. This color even looks better in real than in the picture."
Light and comfortable shoes. I am a 10.5 and buy size 11 for running shoes and this one fits as expected.
"Nice outfit. Fits per spec.

Cons: could be a softer material; question how long the screen print will last. However I'm sure it will be out grown by then."
"the quality is not so great for 20 bucks. i would expect this to be a 15$ bag. super cute tho.

UPDATE!!!! ok i was wrong. the quality is awsum!!! (except the thing that tightens the strings. that is crap. but that is a quick fix with a diff fabric.) i use this bag almost everyday. it hold my stuff, my kids stuff and my husbands stuff."
So comfortable. Lightweight lots of cushion inside. Love the grey colors. Im an 8 1/2 and thats what I got and fit perfect. The toe part is rounded so not a tight squeeze fit like Nike has been usually been the past few years. Insoles are what they say bounce like cushion. Very very comfy!
They work so well
"Absolutely love this dress! Just received it. It is a one piece dress not a skirt & top. Ordered the pale pink/black and the teal/navy. The material is thick but clingy. Being that it is 103 degrees here, these pictures were taken without my Spanx. It will look so much better with the Spanx. The dress shows all of my fat rolls; however, this is a must have! I typically wear an 8 and a 6 depending on how the garment is made. I ordered the medium. The tag says size 6. I am 5'4"" and weigh 145lbs.. 34C. The top was just a little big under the arms but not noticiable. The bottom is tastefully fitted (lose enough that it is not too tight...comfortable). The ONLY thing I do not like is that the zipper color is the color of the top and it stands out. But, I will more than likely order this dress in a few other colors. The more curves, the better this dress will look. I only gave it 4 stars because of the zipper."
........Kinda large...but I like it that way.....I'm pleased.....
Needed an outfit for an big event in Rome Georgia in October...Toga fit well and the quality is surprisingly great...
"These pants feel good while wearing, and are rugged at the same time. They look good on my son or daughter, both of whom like to sag a bit, but they also fit perfectly on me (man in late 50s). No snagging or bulging parts."
"Haven't stopped wearing it for the last few month at work, and its got a nice comfortable fit, maybe one of the best work hats that I  have ever had.
I will be back  for more for sure well done Carhartt !!"
bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. nice material and fits true to size
Soft and cozy sweatpants and Lucky Brand pants are always a good fit!
I paired some beautiful brooches with pashiminas this year and gave them away to all the gals in the family.  This was a huge hit!
The person I gave it to as a gift loves it.
"I love Suunto watches. The watch strap is  soft and fits comfortably on my wrist, which is about 8"". I usually have a hard time with watch straps fitting, but the Suunto straps generally fit well. The watch is easy to use once you read the instructions or watch a YouTube video or two. The screen can be hard to read on occasions, but it has back lighting so there has not been a time when I could not tell what time it is. I have owned several Suunto watches to include the Core All Black, which I also enjoy. The watch is very lightweight, and you can forget you even have it on."
The perfect beach hat
This is an adorable skirt and I'd highly recommend it.  It's a little tight around the waist but the cute flared skirt creates the comfort of it over your thighs and buttocks.  The material is surprising heavy but it's very resilient.  You can roll it in a ball and it still comes out wrinkle free.  Thank you for the opportunity to purchase this skirt at a discount.
Its really cute and mine says hermes on the inside. But how do u put it on?
"The email and advertisement said two free gifts,I only received one.  Other than that; I'm very happy with the balaclava."
"I love this bag. It keeps everything organized and easy to find. I'm not easy on my purses but this one is up to the job. It's very well made and has plenty of room without being bulky or too large. It keeps its shape which makes it easier to reach in and grab your keys, etc. Relic knows what women need and I'm a fan."
Very casual looking. Not really what I would call gray -- more beige. But I like it!
"I have noticed smoother, clearer skin. Great product."
Great seller and product looks better in person. Got it for the wife as a Mother's Day gift. I know she'll love it
Feels sturdy and durable. Nicely made. Haven't tested the RFID claim.
Looks great on my husband. It's one of his favorites.
Great Shoes--Fit to a tee--
"this is so sexy, after trying it on i wanted it in another color.
no regrets at all, and being curvy you just never know."
Gorgeous - Enough said! :)
"bought these sandals last summer, first time buying a Teva product.  I've had no issues, really good fit, and they don't get an odor after a few months like other sandals.  Will buy another pair in the future."
purchased these for my husband and I really like them.  He has skinny legs and small tush and these don't look like he is swimming in them
"The most comfy panties I've ever tried, at first bought one pair and then bought several more in different colors. Very soft material, not irritate at all"
My daughter felt gorgeous in this for Halloween! It fit perfect!
This is a beautiful little necklace- perfect for any gift
Very happy...love these shoes.  I would wear these every day if I could!
"Great quality, fun colors."
AAAHHH SO CUTE!! Loved the way it fits. So many compliments! I am SO STELLAR
"These are good, comfortable shoes after they get broken in.  They initially rubbed a blister in my left ankle because the heels are pretty stiff.

They feel  hot on my feet because the material is thick, but this doesn't bother me too much because I know they'll hold up.  Size was as expected.

So far so good."
"Love it
fits well
 washs well"
"Use for the gym, fit great with no sliding once I start sweating.  Fit is good and after a while of using are still in good shape."
"Great, I got different sizes and gave them as giftls"
"I love these purses.  I have bought 3 in different colors.  They are just  the right size for me.  I have my wallet, keys, kleenex with room to spare. They hold up well, and are lightweight."
"I love these so much. Wear them for days and they don't stink. Don't tell anyone this, but I only have to wash them when I work out :)"
perfect for downsizing from a huge armoire.
"They are a bit small, but I had read the reviews that you should buy a size bigger than you normally wear so this wasn't an issue for me.  I bought these for my upcoming vacation to Cancun so I haven't worn them, but I tried them on and they are really cute and comfortable so far.  I read some of the reviews that said some of the flowers and/or rhinestones were loose or missing, but I didn't have any of those issues.  I am very pleased with this little sandals and for the price if they only last for this vacation they will be well worth the money."
These shoes are very comfortable! I work 12 hour shifts and these shoes have been great. They are wider than Nike air max shoes which for me made all the difference. I ordered a half a size up in case my feet swell during my shift and it seems to be a perfect fit.
good shoes  for running and look good
"I love these for the pool and the gym. They are ultra light weight, easy to put on, comfortable to wear and DO NOT SLIP on the smooth concrete of the pool side. They are right now my favorite thing to wear around the pool and befreoa dna fter I swim and shower at the club.. Very Very pleased with these."
fit as i thought it would. colors are very bright so i am very happy with that. wore them with my cosplay and everyone liked them. one thing i do wish is i wish the green was a darker green instead of that ugly baby poop green. other than that very satisfied.
Bought this on a lightening deal and wish I would have bought a couple more. (Still may) Material is very soft and surprising warm. I hate wearing heavy jackets and see myself wearing this until there is snow on the ground. My only problem is that I washed it with a terry cloth pillow case and now have a fuzzy inside. I was able to remove it with a clothes razor and I am good to go. Great jacket! Highly recommend.
"Living in So Cal, 53 and fair, I am always seeking basic crew necks to protect my neck and chest from constant sun exposure. Even with sunscreen, one walk around the block and theres another freckle or tanning which Im trying to avoid. Amazon Prime has been such a great source. This is a great shirt for the price. Im 54, usually wear a womens medium though my girls can get snug in the more fitted tops. This one fits nicely, a bit snug over the bust, Ill try a large next time. Ill definitely be reordering to keep the supply up. At this price, they don't have to last forever."
"Very soft fabric that washes well, and the shirt appears to be very well made."
Love this product.  My.jewelery shines
"I absolutely love it!!  Can't imagine what I did before getting this.  A perfect size, and you can wear it as a shoulder bag."
Wife loves it.  Happy wife happy life.
Absolutely a gorgeous set totally worth buying bikini's here. Always was spending so much money on bikini's from Victoria's Secret when amazon has amazing prices and the same quality of not better.
Beautiful! Fitted as expected.
"Been using mink oil on my leather for years. This is a decent product. Goes on well, soaks in nicely. I suppose it could be a little ""richer"" but very workable mostly using it on new leather at this time. I'll see how it does as my leather ages and when I apply it to my worn in stuff (currently saddle soaping the older stuff)"
"Great length, didn't shrink. Highly recommend!"
"Great shirt, after a few washes it is nice and soft."
I bought one size up so it wouldn't be tight on my problem areas (you know how telling white is) and wear it a little lower on my hips.  It layers great with tanks and it flattering to my pear shape.  For the first time I can wear white and feel pretty.
Adorable! & comfortable. MY daughter loved wearing these.
"This is my third order of these shoes, in different colors.  I normally wear a size 7.5 regular. I ordered a size 7.  They do run a bit roomy, but very comfortable and lightweight.  I can wear wear them year round. They have a nice footbed with about an inch platform. I am a birkenstock fan and I would say these are very comparable if not more comfortable."
"These shoes are ADORABLE. I get a new pair or two each year. This is my first year with the suede, so I'm hoping they hold up as well. Love these shoes."
"Yah,
Ok, it's a bag.  Lets all keep that in mind, but the thing is incredible.  So, where to start.  I have owned more than a few brief cases, and there fine for the trips and when I have to pack a large amount of paperwork.  I have been looking for something I can take to the office and coffee shop and this is it.  It is nearly indestructible.  I mean, the more you beat it, the better it looks.  Also, it is far larger than you think.  I am 6'2"" and it is a perfect fit for my size.  It can hold all my files and my laptop / ipad easily .  And finally, it looks great.  Like really great.  For all those worried about the man purse (murse) it looks like you stepped off the trail with the pony express and are dusting yourself off to deliver the post.  Indiana jones would be proud to carry it.
Well, there ya go.  Expensive, sure.  But you have to pay to play and this is the pack to do it with."
"Great item, great price, fast shipping! Would buy again. A+++++"
The chain is shiny and beautiful. The 1.5mm is just the right thickness for a longer necklace with pendant I have. Can be used for casual or dressing up.
Very cool.  I love the design of this buckle.  My only complaint is that the top point of the tri-force often pokes into my stomach when sitting or bending.  Its fairly sharp and uncomfortable.  Otherwise I enjoy it.
"This is a nice wallet.  It's a little bigger than I wanted for a pocket wallet, but it fits everything.  The only recommendation that I have is that it needs to be about 1/4 inch smaller all the way around and thickness."
Great fit but I wish the soles were a more supportive or solid feeling.
"Bought this for my grand daughter, and she loves it.  It is very simple and sweet.  It looks great with many of her outfits- a great purchase!"
"The material look cheap, but the dress is i kind of cute , it fit me really good ."
I would not buy again
"Am happy with purchase and fit.  Needed more length in the legs and these fit the bill.  Also, the fabric is not fleece-lined, which I like."
"Boyfriend really likes this belt. He says it was initially an adjustment to unbuckle but once you get the hang of it, it's good to go and sleek! Goes well with business or business casual without being boring. As a business owner, he likes to look sharp but not dull. This is a perfect accent piece."
"Slick looking kicks, easy to put on. Just like all adidas runs large."
"The pointy toes make them ever so slightly snug, and I wear 7.5 M in 90% of my shoe purchases. I almost want to send them back for an 8 B but I plan to wear these with dresses and think the fit will stretch a bit. The one inch lift seems like a good compromise over completely flat shoes versus two inch heels. They do look nice. I had a different impression of this brand years ago in that they went for absolute comfort and health. Now fashion is being balanced with comfort."
the tongue hurts a bit at the top of the foot
Love love love!!! This top is exceptionally cute and it fits great! Love the colors!
Very comfortable underwear! Good coverage but nice stile with v front.
"Was worried they wouldnt fit due to all the reviews on this brand saying they run small. I wear 8 wide, ordered a 9 and they fit absolutely perfect. Cute and comfortable- will be ordering more sbicca shoes!"
"They fit great! The elastic is strong enough to keep your foot in place. I teach little kids so I wear them and I don't feel like I will lose my footing at all! They are very flat, but other than that, they are perfect, and stylish!"
"Impressed with how realistic this looks.  Love using it around the family- they find it more creepy than humorous, which makes it much more amusing to wear! Wore this to a rave and on the third day I established myself as the alpha squirrel."
soooo soft! fit is great. quality is good but it is definitely delicate
"Very cute
Good quality
We like these leggings! Leveret is a great brand!"
This is one of those wonderful times where Amazon has the same product for less.  They are cute mittens also.
So cute..well made...Little great directives it...
"Beautiful, dainty earrings. I got them for my niece and was jealous. Might get a pair for myself too."
"Good quality, perfect fit, classic style."
This is the kool's thing that I have added to my collection
"Just wow, my wife and I actually like these ring more than her wedding ring. Is strikingly beautiful and it just became here new wedding ring. Not my original intention but really happy."
Benny is the best!
Has weathered two Halloweens.  But not as cute as some of the other dinosaur costumes.
So what big but I'm getting in to it never had a wallet that big yet but I'm getting in to it all now it holdes all of my credit cards that's why I like it to
have had sooo many compilments I love it
This shirt fits well and looks great on!!!  The price was a steal!!!  Good buy.
Well worth it. Medium heavy material. Put away now for next planned child
Perfect in every way. Memory foam is amazing. Shoes look adorable on as well. Size is my normal size and I've had no heel slippage like some others have described. Will absolutely but again when I need an additional pair
This is not a heavy bag but is perfect for a little toddler.
"I love, love, love these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes Frye makes. I have 7 pairs. I would buy them in every color of the rainbow if they offered them. People run up to me on crowded streets to ask me where I got them, no kidding. (one woman almost got hit by a city bus...) These are ""it"" shoes!
I ticked the box for ""fits as expected"" because I know that they run about 1/2 size large. I'm normally a size 9 in non-Frye shoes, and in these I need an 8 1/2. They run long. If my feet were narrower, I could have gone with an 8. In light of that comment, an explanation: the 8 1/2s  felt snug widthwise on my medium/wide (buniony) feet when I first put them on, but they stretched to fit beautifully (it was the same with all seven pairs). The 8s were much tighter than that. I don't think they would have stretched to fit my width as well as the 8 1/2s.

They look great with  dresses, jeans, skirts, capris and even winter shorts with tights. I seriously love these shoes. I want them all! I wish they'd make bright blue, olive green, yellow and purple! I need a backup red pair very soon. Expensive, but worth every penny. Oh, and FWIW, the bottoms are leather, so they are very slippery at first, so either put those sticky grips on the bottoms, or go outside and scrape your sole bottoms on the concrete to make them less slick. Love <3"
"I am headed to Central America for a 10-day trip.  Lots of walking and since their rainy season will be starting about that time, I was looking for something comfortable that could get wet and dry our quickly.  I needed something that could transition from casual to semi dressy and these fit the bill.  They are truly feather weight, and offer good support.
I am comfortable in endorsing this product for quality and comfort."
"I love these pants.  I purchased 4 pair to wear on an overseas trip.  I don't know how they will look over the long run, but they were very comfortable to wear for the flight and all the sight seeing/walking I did.  I added a dressier top and got away with wearing them out to dinner.  I stayed in different hotels with 3 night stays.  I had time to wash them out and they dried within 24 hours.  If I could wear them to work every day, I would."
"this is perfect for traveling , i love that you can wipe of the exterior when you get home as you do put it on the floor a lot when traveling.the colors go with everything and won't show the dirt or scratches..."
So cute! The girls love to sleep dressed like a princess
New staple to my wardrobe this summer. Love it.
"very nice sweater, fit true to size, pattern and colors are very nice, a good purchase."
Gorgeous dress. Was not itchy and good quality.
Excellent piece of luggage. Just know that it won't fly on some international flights.  When buying luggage you must know the size requirements of the airlines you will be likely to fly on.
"I did sent back, only to get a small/med size  I was going to order 4 more, when they were selling for $14.99/ now they are selling for $22.25 this increase is only in This last week,, that really it a Hugh increase!!!!!!!!!! too bad as the petticoat is wonderful  I shall leave a comment and also mention abt the almost $8.00 Increase in just one week  Dorothy/ loosing a customer"
"I'm normally a 10-9 1/2 for shoes, especially boots, but these do run a little large. I repurchased a 9 instead and they fit very well, comfortable, a little pinching on the sides of my toes, but I have a wider foot, plus I've only worn them a few times so they should eventually stretch out a bit more. Good quality boot, cute and stylish, for a good price."
Very nice bracelet for under 20 buckets.  I love that you can adjust the fit without the need to use tools.  Plus it does not jingle like other heavy stainless steel bracelets I have purchased in the past from other vendors.  It looks great with casual wear and for going out semi-formal wear.
"The watch is very good for the price, I purchased a new battery because the original stopped working and its still in good condition"
"These stockings are very well made. They stay up without garters and I wore them several times before they ran. I'm 5'9"" and they are perfect length for me. If you are much shorter than that they will probably be too long"
fits beautifully - it is comfortable and sexy as well as gives the right amount of support - while it may be $$ it is sooooo worth it!
I'VE WORN THIS RING EVERYDAY SINCE IT ARRIVED--LOOKS GREAT AND ELEPHANT TRUNKS UP--MEANS GOOD LUCK.
"I think shoes are designed for a wider foot with shorter toes (ie- Flintstone feet) as opposed to a long, narrow foot. Also, Amazon lists them as ""hiking shoes,"" but I don't think Keen advertises them as such. They're a bit too light and don't offer any ankle support like most hiking shoes. I see them more as a water shoe-- something you'd wear to a theme park (or school or camp). With that said, they're very cute and very well made. I am impressed with the amount of wiggle room in the toe box for a non-wide shoe."
Awesome!!! Over my expectations!!! Thanx!!! ;)
my husband loved them!  Great Father's Day gift.
"I love my Bogs for barn chores.  They keep my feet warm, dry and comfortable for hours when it's ugly out.  This is my 2nd pair, I bought the first in 2008 or 2009?  And I only replaced them because they got stepped on by a horse and aren't waterproof anymore.  These are good looking, comfy and really durable.  LOVE my Bogs!"
These are really well made shirts.
"I already have one Anuschka and am complimented on it practically every day.  Can't wait to see what happens with this one.
It is the most beautiful bag I have ever seen. Even my husband was impressed."
"For starters I'm 5'5"" about 175 lbs size 16. They fit great, snug just as they should be. They stretch to accommodate various sizes but I wouldn't buy if you're very much bigger than I am as they will not fit comfortably. Length is good as well, will work ok if you're a bit taller but if you wear with boots, length won't matter so much. Looks great with boots and a long sweater. A little on the thin side so not ideal for a harsh winter but not thin enough to almost see through. They look as pictured. Would buy again."
"Bought this as a gift and after it was opened, we all tested it.  Relatively easy for kids to use, shot pretty far, it was a big hit with our 6 year olds.  i would recommend it, i think it's worth the price."
"I had purchased a wood bracelet with the same markings, and was looking for matching earrings.  I came across these.  I'm so happy I purchased them because they are just right. They are not too large nor too small.  I also liked the casing that they came in and the price is just right.  I intend to purchase some more wood earrings in the future."
"Bought these for my husband who has trouble finding shoes because of his wide feet, these fit perfect and are very warm! Highly recommend!"
"I placed the order Monday morning and received it that Thursday morning! I was a little concerned I wouldn't receive it by this weekend because that's when we are having our daughter's party, but it came in really fast!! Faster than I thought! (Thank you!) And the dress is absolutely gorgeous and so adorable! I cannot wait for the family to see her in it! Thanks so much!

Great fit very good price and super comfortable!
"Just I thought, just like you see it in the virtual shop, I recommend it a hundred porcent good color and material"
Love this dress. The fabric is gorgeous and I received many compliments! Can't wait to buy in another color.
This waist trainer is the best. Thanks to all the ladies and their reviews. This trainer is just like the picture and the picture reviews. its very comfortable for latex material. some women stated it broke at the hooks not for me i have worn mines for two weeks no clips broken or thread loosen. now im used to the stug fit at first now my waist has adjusted to it i will be in a smaller size soon. just handle it with care and it won't break. I will order again from this company Excellent product and price.
"The shoe itself be sure to order one size bigger than you normally wear.  I always wear a 7 and I had to have them send me and 8.  They were so fast with the order and I spoke with Debbie several time over the course of the time frame.  I needed them for a wedding and she was fantastic to help me with my deadline.  The shoe is ""BEAUTIFUL""  I had ordered another style from another company but this one is just gorgeous and comfortable.  I had bunion surgery on my right foot in Jan. and even though I still deal with some swelling in the big this shoe felt great on."
Great welder
"Love this full skirt I'm 5'3"" I have to fold the top one time wearing flats.. If I was wearing heels I wouldn't have to do that"
falls forward all the time drives me crazy but i like the way it looks as long as i am not moving ha ha ha
fast shipment fit is good really have had them long enough to give a great review will post more later the price was wonderful thank you
My second pair.  I wore out the first pair. Very Comfortable.
I bought these for my son who has had a problem with keeping his glasses on.  These have helped him out a lot and he really likes them!
My tall teenage godson loves it.
Nice and loose.
"We really like the look of these shoes. However the beautiful red color has rubbed off in one place, revealing a black substrate. Honestly, they look so nice that we might just buy some more."
It's a little longer than I expected. I bought it for my niece's 1st birthday and she's by no means teeny. She's about 23 lbs. This dress is probably a better fit for a child closer to 18months. My niece still looked cute in it though.
This is one pair of boits so awesome.  Fair priced. Looks great with jeans tucked in or even with shorter skirts. I can't express how much i like them. Thank you. God Bless.  Deborah
"It's really fitted. If you have wide feet, go up a size. I've survived with these boots so far and they've done a good job keeping my feet dry and toasty during winter this year."
Not as cute as I thought but its ok
"Cute , comfy but very thin !"
The shoes is a brilliant red and they are real uggs. The material is soft and durable the qualityis excellent.
"Buying it large is to allow for growth, since it was a gift for my granddaughter. I don't really have a way of knowing how it fits. Either way I know she will grow into it."
"Second time buying for my husband.  He loves this hat.  Cool and lightweight.  My son spied it and so I had to order two more, one for a spare!"
"Bought it for my son, who is 9. He loves it. Never takes it off. Warning- not water proof. Not effeminate."
Fit nicely  looked nice for formal event or would be fine for office. They did not wrinkle.  Recommend
Levi's are just plain awesome.  What was even better was the price on this order as it ran 20-40% less than the local department stores
"I don't know why Corso Como don't make these anymore- Ive gone through like 10 pairs of these. My best guess is they had too many returns because they don't last very long, which makes me wonder why they don't just reduce the price (I think the retail was $60).These are not for walking outside on grass or at the park because the sole is so thin - one time a twig went straight through and poked my foot. Theyre more for just walking on dry clear areas in good weather."
I bought this pair after reading the reviews.  The shoes came in as expected; fit just right and very comfortable.  I would love to buy some other colors but they do not usually come in size 5.  I love them.  I paid $50 for it on Amazon but recently the price went up to $68.
"I am a die hard nimbus runner but I decided to try these, as all of my nimbus are dying. These are not nearly as marshmallowey but my feet don't hurt after any distance either. They are a good runner up (haha) to the nimbus."
It was as described
"Can't imagine anything better for the price.  It's light, and it appears a little small, but I was surprised at just how much stuff I could pack in here.  It's a pretty blue, too.  Seems quite durable.  Would make a great gift for anyone who travels.  I hang it in the bathroom near the shower and use it until I'm ready to move on, then just pick it up, zip and go.  I bought this design becuase I already have it in a bigger and much more expensive bag.  Love this one as much."
"This backpack is pretty much what I expected -- I'm not a backpack person (never was, even in school, but my chriopractor recommended it), so I'm having some trouble adjusting to smoothly getting it on, off, and getting things into and out of it. Because of my unfamiliarity with backpacks, I do think this could be an issue with me and not the bag.  It's also a little tight for all the things I routinely carry, so I have to make things fit as opposed to just popping things in as with a larger shoulder bag. (As with most Baggallini products, the credit card slots and internal 'organization' is worthless.)

It is very light and comfortable and more chic looking than a 'regular' backback so it can work with business casual and not ruin the outfit.  I'm only giving it four stars because the straps aren't adjustable and that's a problem.  They are about 3-4 inches too long and so it kind of bumps against my lower back, instead of fitting more snugly to the middle as it would if I could adjust it those critical inches. I do like the fact that it can be zipped and re-clipped to be a one shoulder sling, which I do if I'm going to be getting into and out of it a lot as opposed to just walking around somewhere.

All in all, I'm pleased, but I don't think I'd feel four stars pleased if I hadn't gotten a good sale price."
I really like this top! The material feels nice and the cut looks good! Can recommend it and would buy it again.
LOVE LOVE IT.
I love my new platforms
Love it. The fit is great!
"Super soft, almost sweatshirt material. LOVE how comfy if feels and that I can wear it to work."
"The girls use these in the summer and with socks in the winter, after taking of cleats or basketball sneakers.  The nubs on the insoles may feel weird at first, but once you get used to them it's like a mini foot massage!  The top is velcro and adjusts to all size feet-wide and narrow."
The shirt is great quality but my son wears a men's medium and this didn't fit... gave it to my son who wears a men's small... idk if all are sized too small or if it was random... great shirt though
wear all the time!
"So I wanted an unhooded sweatshirt with pouch pockets in the front. Could not find what I wanted, so I ordered this a handout the hood off. So I the end, I got what I wanted.
I generally wear a small-medium, and the medium fit well.
Seems to wash well, without much shrinkage, if any."
"I was riddled with mastitis and needed a comfortable bra that was still supportive for my large breasts after my 4th baby. I have had this bra for three days and so far, it's exactly what I was looking for!"
Fits good just a little short but I have my daughter put shorts on under her dresses any way so it wasn't a big deal for me
"I love it fit perfectly, full coverage with shape in a beautiful rayon fabric silvery embroidered. High quality"
"Am waiting for my 2 year old grandson to arrive for a visit in May, so I ordered a size larger has mommy says he has wide feet.  Mommy likes them so that is good enough for me!"
"These pants have an excellent classic trouser shape and fit like my other NYJD of the same size.  However, the fabric composition is 68% rayon, 27% nylon, 5% spandex, not ""63% Polyester/33% Rayon/4% Spandex"" as stated in the product description."
"Love the way they look, perfect heel size, comfortable and roomy."
"A little large about 1/2 size too big, but the most comfortable shoes one could have"
People go nuts over this dress! This design is soooo pretty and different. Lots of compliments.
"bought for a gift.
and the kid who received loves it."
All products by Champion that I have bought are highest quality. They fit well and are durable.
Bought this for my son. He loves it.
"Wow! I finally found a plus size dress in a color other than black! This dress is a real standout! The color and pattern are perfect for my large figure. It hides my flaws well. The length is perfect, I love the neckline, and the sleeves are flattering. I'll be on the lookout for other dresses from the Dana Kay label."
I'm obsessed with these hats and socks!!! My other two children had a bunch of them too. It's my must have!! I have already bought my unborn son 4 different sets in different sizes. Buy a bunch you won't be sorry. They are a bit small so be aware of that. The do wash well it you lay them flat to dry.
This product is great. Only bad thing is that I ordered the 12 month size and it runs small.  You may want to order a size up.  Other than that it's super cute and delivery was fast.
Looks just like it's pictured.  No it's not great quality leather and certainly the handles won't last much beyond a couple of months of heavy use but it's a lovely lightweight bag to go with specific outfits. It shipped promptly and its a lovely color.  I've received many compliments on it!
"Arms are too long,.otherwise  ok."
My girl loved them :).
LOVE these boots! Very comfortable (wore them for about 4 hours walking around six flags with no trouble). They look great with skinny jeans. The zipper in the bag is very stylish. Probably my favorite pair of Frye's!!
Nice color. True to size. Didn't shrink after washing. Comfortable soft cotton shirt.
great looking shirt. Seemed a little large but maybe suppose to be.
Love these shoes!!!!  Sooooo comfortable and the style and colors are great. Get many compliments
Easy to bend.. but really pretty. My daughter hasn't taken them off since Christmas.
"Fits perfectly.  Not cut for juniors.  After 2 children, I feel a little self conscious wearing my bathing suit at the water park, and it's sometimes a little cold, so these were perfect.  They look like regular shorts but dry pretty quickly - faster if you hang them to dry."
"Plenty of space for all of my jewelry storage needs! I have a lot of silver and sterling silver rings that I needed to be able to store in one spot and this fit the bill! I do wish that it had more space for necklaces, but considering that this wasn't meant for that, I'm not docking off points for it. I simply used the watch/bracelet storage for my necklaces instead. I absoltutely love this!"
ma sister loveit
I cannot give you an accurate review since I have yet to give it as a gift. What I did see looks perfect and the box  was even beautiful. Thank you
It's a bit large my have to have some links removed other then that its a very nice watch
Looks and feels great. I wear them in the house instead of shoes.
Looks great.
"Excellent small luggage scale. Perfect for travelling and measure weights.
It can be change between kilogram and pound in order to check the correct weight depending in the airline and country.
In addition it has a practical thermometer that can also be change between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Since is really small and thin is easy to pack and you should use it in any trip."
love the kimo robe fits grat and is so soft would definately by agin.
"This swimsuit is very cute and well made. I like the orange and navy color, and my husband says the suit is flattering.
It would be more flattering if the sizing was more true to size. It seems that most swimsuits are made in China and they don't seem able to get the sizing correct.
I love the top of this swimsuit. It came with those padded cup liners, but I took those out and threw them away. They are always way too small for me.  This swimsuit does not have an underwire, but it supports me very well. It has spaghetti straps underneath the thick top straps that hold everything in place. The rouching also holds the tummy in.
I don't like the bottoms very much. In the picture on the listing they look like boy shorts. What I received looks more like traditional bikini cut. They are a little small, but thankfully the top covers them most of the time.
If the bottoms looked more like the photo and the sizing was better, this would be 5 stars. As is, it's still a decent suit. The top is better made than some of the way more expensive suits I've tried on.
I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinions and feedback."
These fit as expected.  I love them!  I would order them in other colors.
Very cute and we'll made . but too big
"I want to order another one of these in a different color or pattern but unfortunately, navy is the only 1 offered in my size.  I feel pretty wearing this & it is rare that my hubs says anything about my clothing but he even remarked how nice it looked on me."
Great price. Exactly as pictured. Fast & secure shipping.
"Great quality printing, super soft shirt. Has a kind of ""weathered"" aesthetic. My only (minor) complaint is that it has a tag, which is a bit uncomfortable if you don't remove it, but that's easy to fix."
Bought these for a trip to Seattle. They were comfy and kept my feet warm and dry. Great pair of boots!
"Nice soft straw hat. I'm a 7 5/8 size, got the XL. It was a good bit too large. I stuck a complete circle of weather stripping around the inside of the band.
 Fits nice now."
It's warm and comfortable! I love it! The color is great!
"Loved this, exactly as shown and comfortable"
"Super cute. But if you have a slight to moderate arch, you can only wear them for a little while, otherwise it kills your feet."
Super cute jeans!
Great Tee! True to size and doesn't feel cheap at all. Very happy with this purchase.
"I love the idea of this purse, but it is heavy and bulky, not to mention very deep with a small opending. Surprisingly well made and hardy.

Very cute, and i recommend as the inside is pretty roomy. Again my only problem is when i put it over my shoulder. It made me realize that i was an over the body purse person for the activities i do.

Great purse, just not the most ideal for my lifestyle."
T-shirt soft.
"I was very happy with this purchase, the pajamas fit well and are very comfortable.  They wash well on the gentle cycle warm water.  I highly recommend this
Saturday

Dorothy"
"It's a little overpriced, but it's really nice quality.  I like it because you can add it to any top without a collar and make it have that super cute doll look."
"good shoes, fits well and thats saying something with size 12 womens shoes!"
An amazing bag. It's lasted me years
These sandals are very comfortable and very easy on the knees.  The arch support is perfect.  I love them.
So they are not bad. Little right in the crouch area but good material. And fit alright.
"I wear an 8.5 but always by a 9 in ASICS. These shoes are great for people like me who do a lot of jumping jack/jump rope type workout. Ive had surgery to remove bunions on both feet and these shoes keep the ball of foot area cushioned when  rebounding. I also remove the insole and put in dr. Scholl  athletic or running insoles. It takes some trimming to contour them for the shoe, but Ive been combing ASICS and dr scholl for years and have had no problems with my feet."
"Very cute, I just wish that the argyle pattern went further up the leg for when I wear shorter skirts. The sweater material used is very warm--so this is good for cooler weather, but probably not warmer weather."
"This dress is phenomenal.  It is one of the best costumes I have ever owned.  I look forward to wearing this on many occasions.  I need to get it hemmed though, because it is very long.  It would be perfect for someone a little taller (I'm 5'3""), so if you taller ladies (and gents) are worried about length, DO NOT BE.  It will fit your height very nicely."
I like this style.  It rides up a bit though.
This fit perfectly and was a big hit!
Very satisfied. My kids had seen this in a store for a ot more and even with S/H it was still cheaper and great quality.
"I really like the shoe, but they may be just slightly smaller than I thought. They are very comfortable and supportive."
"I had to reorder this item as I had followed the reviews originally.  I am a curvy and muscular size six normally, so I was worried that the smaller size wouldn't fit.  However, the larger size was so droopy in the front, it looked ridiculous. Go with your normal dress size.  I am 5'5"" and 155 pounds with a DDD cup size and the s/m fit perfectly."
very comfortable and nice looking boots. i love how it looks and got many compliments on it already.
"Ordered these in a size 9, which is what I usually buy. Had to return them for an 8.5, which was a perfect fit. These are great running shoes!"
This is the cutest bag pack my daughter loves it
"I bought this for my daughter. She loves how comfortable it is and it fits her well. She is a size medium, but I purchased a large as she said she wanted it to be a little baggy and it is exactly as she wants it."
"This is a really cute, stylish black dress. Very form-fitting and sexy and the dress itself is well made. Ive had no issues with it whatsoever."
"Great shoe, but it is bulky and heavy. But sturdy."
"These boots seem very sturdy and undestroyable, and of high quality. True to size. The leather is thick and very nice looking and the details (stamping and lace hooks) are pretty. The soles are very (unusually I would say) thick. I really liked the leather lining - silky and so soft, you won't hurt your bare ankles wearing shorter socks.

I only wore the boots around the house, so I can't comment on how they hold up, though I'm sure they would do a superior job. I returned them because they are VERY heavy. I was going on vacation intending to walk for hours (8+) every day - I thought that these would make my legs tired sooner. I tried on many hiking boots before leaving and weighed all of them. Most were 13 oz, one or two pairs 16 oz, these were 19. Doesn't sound like a big deal, I know. But I could really feel the weight. 6 extra oz per step, thousands step per day - I think it would add up.

I chose Anhu Montara in Red Mahogany and fell in love with them during my vacation, never wanted to take them off! My second choice was Merrell Azura Carex in wine color (yes, I did want boots in as close to red color as possible) but I didn't believe their soles and they were not vibram. These Teva boots were my third choice.
For colder weather or really tough hikes I would choose Keen Gypsum. I was so sorry to let them go! So comfortable. I'm still thinking about getting them back."
I love these sandals! They look great. Very comfortable. Nice to find leather shoes esp for such a low price. I think they fit perfectly. My feet aren't wide - I think they're rather average. I chose the size I always wear in shoes that aren't flip flops (then I go up half a size).
"This hat/hood/scarf/mittens combo is just about the cutest thing I have ever worn. My husband won't let me wear it out of the house if we're together (he says he's embarassed) but even he admits that it's adorable. I wore it once to run errands on a Saturday, and I got a lot of double takes and then genuine eye-contact smiles. Sure they could have been laughing AT me, but usually when that's the case, the other person doesn't meet your eyes. It is always my goal to make strangers smile. Come to think of it, I don't even mind if they are laughing at me.

The fur is so soft, it fits nicely (does ride back if you have the scarf/paws in front of your body, so you have to play around with the feel that you think looks best with your hairdo). It's very very warm, so it does it's job, too. Be careful driving with it on, as it doesn't move with your head, so turning or seeing your blind spot can be a problem! I would advise NOT wearing it while driving. But you can just move the head part back like a hood, and the scarf/paws keep it on your shoulders very easily. I want to buy this in every color. Well worth the very low price (I think it was $10 when I got it)."
"Little small but good quality cotton with solid print, I get great compliments when I wear it! If you got attitude, get it but order a size up!"
true ti size
"My husband like it, unfortunately it was big."
The hooded Turkish bathrobe it perfect for me.  It is not so thick and heavy that it is hard to manage wearing around.  It is not  thin that it doesn't do the job of a good robe.  To me it tends toward thick medium in thickness.  It is very well make and good quality.  I received the plum with matching slippers and the color is beautiful..  I prefer hooded robes because a towel wrapped for my hair never stays put.  I haven't given the shower test yet - so I don't know how it will absorb water - but since it is 100% cotton it should be fine.
"These sandals are very comfortable. Have a great traction and are non slippery (more than I'm used to).
Overall sandals are good to go."
Fast delivery.  Just what I expected and wanted. Would highly recommend ordering from this company.
"Just got my watch and I love it.  The center section of each link is brushed metal and the outside is polished (from the picture, I thought it was all polished).  This is what I would have chosen, i think it will show wear less this way, and I'm planning to wear it for a loooong time.  I'm enjoying it as a fairly loose bracelet with no links removed.  Since it tends to hang just in the indent above my thumb bones, I think it will be exposed to light more  when I'm wearing long sleeves, and I can more easily see the face without moving my sleeve.  With high contrast between the hands and the back, it's easy to read even in quite low light. My last watch had gold hands and gold face - It was hard to read in anything but full sun.  I'm 67 but have good eyesight and I can read the date, though it is small.

I love that I can wear it in the shower and swimming.  If I don't have to take it off, I don't have to worry about losing it or forgetting to put it back on."
"These boots fit perfectly and are easy to put on and take off.  They are very well made and keep your feet warm at below zero temps.  I had paid $150 for a European boot which was impossible to put on--I never was able to put my foot into one, so I returned those and found these."
nice undies but runs small and shrinks after washing
"I am a 65 year old woman who has been wearing boys shoes for years as my feet are short and wide. These fit perfectly and are warm and seem to wear better than woman's shoes. Each year a new pair replaces the old pair which replace an older pair that get demoted to yard shoes.
Great plan and it works for me."
Shoes look good# and feel great#
Cute for the gym. Is a bit larger on me so I just tied it in the back. This shirt will expose your bra and sides (as seen in picture) but that is not a surprise. I like the shirts lightweight material and definitely wear it in the gym or outside
"Very cool graphics and good print, no defects.  The shirt itself is a bit on the thin side and may shrink a bit, but fits well and don't expect any issues."
"Love these little shoes. They're great for the price. Probably won't last more than a few months, but I'm ok with that for $12. I had read the reviews so I knew to order a size smaller."
Came perfect
Not for big/larger ankles.  Such cute socks!!!!!
"This is BEAUTIFUL! It's large and really stands out! I have looked around for awhile for a clad ring and I'm telling you this does not disappoint. It's durable, shines and fits like it was made just for just me. I did get one size larger than what I normally wear because the band is thicker. Love it! Love it! Love it!!!!!"
I got these for my 26 year old son who works outside! He said they are the BEST !!! They keep him warm and dry !! He said to order 2 sizes up of your regular waist size !But length the same size !He said to remember you are wearing them over your regular clothing!! Thank you Amazon for getting them here so quickly !!
"Very pretty, light weight and colorful!"
"i like the comfort and different color tones that can match with many things. also good on wet surfaces.
very comfortable yet casual shoe. i have a navy blue that goes with alot of things as well and still just as
comfortable a year later."
"Very comfortable; excellent product; very appealing to my likes, arrived timely.. Plan to wear them on my trip to Israel."
"I got this purse for a trip I was taking. Because I was only allowed to carry-on items, I put this purse inside my suitcase to use once I got to my destination. That way I was allowed to take my carry-on suitcase and another smaller suit case.  It is the perfect size to fit my cell phone, my IDs and cash, lipgloss, small pill bottle, and a pen,  With plenty of space and does not look over stuffed.  there are slots for your cards or business cards. There is a zipper pocket inside. Great size."
"Excellent quality, nice and roomy. Fits in all my purses .the leather quality is excellent. Credit card holder is roomy."
Great shoes!  So cute!  Great for leg day or any day really!
I wear 9 1/2 in sandals usually and the size 40 fits perfectly.
"I only buy more Reefs when my old ones die. (in this case my dog ate them)  Fit great, comfortable."
These are lovely!  I'm happy they're available in wide width.  The leather is soft and they hug the feet nicely.
Could not believe how pretty this item was!  I bought it as a gift but decided to keep it for myself.  I will be buying more of these later to give as gifts!
"I have always liked Duckies products. I am retired now, and I don't have to wear them, but I WANT to. In fact, I am wearing this shirt as I write about it. I plan to get more like it."
Very nice gown with stylish accents.
"This is a light weight robe with white piping on the shawl collar and cuff line. This robe is very well made  . While it is labeled as a mans robe, there is no reason  that women cannot wear it .  Everyone who tried it on here was over 220 pounds and we all liked the fit, but smaller people could also wear this . The belt  is solidly stitched onto the back and will definitely stay attached. This is definitely real silk and feels very nice.  The  care directions do call for hand washing and drying flat .  I'd say this is well worth the price  it is a comfortable , good quality, classic  styled robe."
"So I loved this, it's different and sexy. I am 5'6"" and small on top med on bottom and it fits perfectly. I would say I have an average length torso. The boob part is definitely way small! Not for the busty. The straps are pretty narrow. I paired it with lace top thigh high tights."
Great quality.  Fits perfect not too tight but not baggy.
"Third pair of these. Wear as indoor slippers, really comfortable!"
"Better then I expected.  A little big but acceptable.  Seem well set in the posts.  I wanted these for everyday wear and have exceptionally sensitive skin, cannot stand anything w/ nickel.  These do not bother me at all."
I bought these to hold for November for my granddaughter's 21st birthday.  Every young woman should have pearl stud earrings and these are quite lovely.  I know she will enjoy them.
Awesome undies. Nothing on the hip. Dry really fast I used yesterday for a kickboxing class and always I need to change my underwear wick cus there are soak in sweat. This Guys not. And I but under my cup holder and match really good. I am not kidding is a very good product for the price
"I have several pay of Go Walks and they are comfortable.  However, there is not much support so my feet do ache at the end of the day.  I purchased these for my nursing clinicals and they tend to ""squeak"" when I walk.  Will wear them as a last resort, but have since purchased a different brand/style of shoe."
Good fit and fast delivery.
"Bought the long leg version of these and they fit as expected, ill be buying more of these in the future as they are comfy and appear very well made"
"Love this light weight sweater, purchased 4 different colors!"
Love them! Perfect for my littles to put on without help. Will buy these regularly as they get older!
"It is hard to find a good, comfortable sports bra for DDD.  This bra is made with the underwires on the outside, which makes it much better.  You look like you have it on wrong side out but that's how it's made.  It do medium intensity workouts and this bra works great."
They are beautiful as soon as they came in I ordered 3 more colors!  For some reason I can't give a pic but please believe me THEY ARE AMAZING!!!
"I like it.  Wearing it now. It's super soft, but not as warm as I had hoped. It's thin, much thinner than I expected for the price. It does fall nicely into place and looks good on. It's more of  a fashion scarf than a functional scarf."
"Got these for my son and daughter.  She loves hers, they are cute and comfortable.  He has wider feet and felt like they were too narrow.  I love that you can use with or without liner!"
"This dress is amazing! It fits perfectly, a little snug, but extremely comfortable. I get so many compliments every time I wear it. It's perfect with thigh heels and fancy jewelry for date night, or dress it down a little and it's great for church. The length is perfect (just below the knee) for chasing my little ones around. I bought it in two colors, and will definitely get a couple more! I did notice a slight difference in the material between the different fabrics, but they are both great!"
"I like the shirts. Purchased in four colors. In my case, the shirts run somewhat large. I ordered XL, which I generally wear, but a L probably would have worked better."
I love these and they are very well made !!
Money belt is constructed well and card pouches made of good quality material to withstand extended travel.  Fabric tabs on zipper pulls may be unnecessary since pulls are easily gripped for operation.
It's bigger than I expected but that's a plus. I am very happy with my new backpack.
"I have narrow feet and bought these in a narrow width (AA).  They fit perfectly in the front.  No shoes fit me in the heel, as my heels are extremely narrow.  My heel with is probably an AAAAA.  Since the front of the shoe fits me perfectly, I am able to keep them on without slipping out of them."
The size fit very well and I dance and exercise with them all the time so I feel the are very good and buying more
"good sturdy quality. holds me in place. kinda makes me look bigger so there is potential for bouncing when i get to running, but not too bad."
"Heavy duty, fits as expected, unlinew so more of a wind block"
You can't go wrong with these great shoes.  I love them.  Well made and looks great.  So comfortable and I wear them to work every day.  10.5 size women are hard to find but I always seem to find them at Amazon!  And at a great price.
Didn't mind he will grow in it
The closure on the jewelry box was snapped off the first time I opened it (before wrapping it for my daughter). The box itself is really cute and the drawers in unexpected places (like the sides and the back) are cool.
These were great for my small newborn.  She was born 3 weeks early weighing 5lbs 11oz and these were a perfect fit.
"Bought for my husband and they fit perfict. I'm not sure if I ever paid this much for my shoes, but he has them for years and years. I guess that's what they say is true, you get what you pay for. They also look great."
The size is a little small.  Next time I'll go up one more size.  Good quality.
"Very nice belt. Competitively priced. Had it for a month or so, and no sign of wear and tear so far."
"Very comfortable, warm, and well-made.  Great value"
"Nice t-shirt, the green is very vibrant (though maybe it should have been Walter White's siganture blue??) and it is just a fun novelty shirt. Haven't worn or washed a lot but so far holding up just like a normal t-shirt."
Love Dickies for work. These are great.  Decent price compared to brick and mortar stores.
I love thes mules - they do run about a size bigger than true to size.  With thick socks great!  Use for slippers with a great arch support.
Is The best
I bought a white one in the store so I knew exactly what style annd size I needed.
"First, let me say that I wear size 15. I only buy shoes online. The big men's stores stock garbage as far as shoes.  My right foot is a little larger than my left, my left being more like a 14 1/2.  With these Bogs, I detect a tiny bit of snugness in the toe area on the right foot. This is why I said ""somewhat small."" Nothing major, and not uncomfortable at all.  I just got them a little while ago, and have worn them several times already. Obviously not what you need for deep snow. But after the deep snow is cleaned up, there are many days of slush and muck. Just slip 'em on.  Nice tread on the bottom, kind of like a snow tire. Totally sealed and waterproof, and my feet stay warm walking through the slush. I would not want them larger because they stretch around the ankle area and fit tight to the foot, so no snow gets in. There were a few other choices as far as this kind of shoe. I am really glad I chose these, and the price was reasonable also. I'll get a lot of use out of these shoes."
This sling bag is awesome! I bought it for a friend who lives in a 3rd world country that has to walk wherever he goes. I was so impressed with this bag! The size is great! There are 9 pockets to put what you want to carry! It is lightweight. The material is sturdy and the stitching looks durable. The shoulder strap is padded well and will be great for him to wear while walking or riding a motorcycle. The pull strings on the zippers are not flimsy! They will hold up for a very long time! The bag looks manly or I would keep it for myself! I received this at a discount for an honest review. My opinions are my own. This is a perfect bag for a guy to use on a regular basis!
"I love this handbag! It's lightweight and practical with lots of pockets. The inner lining is soft. Felt secure traveling with it. Now using it as my daily bag, fits everything and I can even fit my kindle or tablet."
Love them!! Super cute & Fit perfectly. Goes wit
"Bought for someone else, she seems to like it and fits well"
Love the earrings.  Not too heavy and lots of sparkle. Glad I bought them.
Nice flip flops. Lots of support. Good shipping as well.
"love them very comfortable I have worn these out dancing, shopping or for a quick errand. Easy to slip on and run. They look great w/a pair of jeans!"
Super cute and nice size.
Nice quality Nine West sandals at a great price!
They cover my face and eyebrows. I love how big they are.
"I was kind of hesitant to keep this shirt because I didn't like the feel of the fabric when I opened the package but since I ordered 3, I figured I'd wash one and see how it went.  I'm glad to report that it was just as comfy as the other Hanes v-neck t shirts that I love and wear just about everyday so I'll be keeping all 3!"
"Perfect.  These stay up without pinching.  Some of the lace top thigh highs don't hold tight enough - these are perfect.  Suntan is a little dark for me in the winter, but will be perfect for the summer.  They feel very silky"
"My husband's a pretty big guy (5'11, 350lbs). He usually wears a 5X shirt and 48in pants. I got him the 5X and they fit him perfectly!"
"They are boxers, not sure what else you need to know. They fit well, or as it says and are very comfortable"
"I am not a ""nightie"" girl at all. This ""long gown"" is not only
totally comfy, the color is to love. I don't feel like I have to ""get dressed""
in the mornings in case the neighbor comes. It is somewhat thin, but what
isn't anymore ?! I ordered an XL only because I'm busty. could have gotten by
with a Large."
Was really impressed with the necklace... very nice!
This dress is very flattering; it hugs in all the right places.
The quality is excellent! It is much thinner than I imagined. This a bare minimum wallet for sure.
"Great Shoes: I do a lot of boating where they work the best! Updated Sperry Sole. Works Great!
Even if you're not a boater they have a great look and very comfortable. Durability is fantastic!"
My wife needed a business Rolling Laptop Case for carting her laptop and files around.  This one was perfect because it was sturdy and not too heavy!  She Loves It!
Excellent watch! Worth every penny.
Very nice pants with a great price.
"This laptop computer bag has ample storage and is pleasingly stylish. The telescoping handle is long enough for all height people, but feels like it's not attached firmly (wiggles). Overall, this is a great travel bag for office or student."
"I live in the Phoenix, AZ area which has a lot of dry, hot weather, and stuff really dries up out here, including the glue on the soles on a pair of hiking boots I had.  I first was going to throw out the boots but then remembered Shoe Goo I successfully used on running shoes many years ago back east.  This stuff worked great again and saved me having to purchase a new pair of boots!  Would buy again for sure.  One tube will last you a long time."
Absolutely love these!!!!!!!!!! Look and fit perfect!
"I bought them for my father, a senior definitively these are this kind os shoes, he has two more pairs or birkentock,  I think these are for every one who want to walk save and comfi"
Fast works well
"Beautiful, soft, and very large cover for a plus size gal! I absolutely love it!"
I like them but they get caught on my clothes sometimes and pulls on my ear. Ouch!
My bf and I get compliments on this set frequently.
"These polos made nice Father's Day presents for my husband.  Bought the Navy and Ligonberry.  Perfect fit for my husband in Medium, relaxed but not loose, fits like a t-shirt, sleeves are the right length, not too long (some polos have short sleeves that almost reach the elbows, like GrandDad's!).  Nice color and suble pattern.  Although the material is a blend of poly and cotton, this polo is soft, cool, and very comfortable on the skin.  My husband loves them and (for $24.99) I love the price and the quality."
I bought a second one! Great for hospital phone or my iphone.
I love it it's exactly as described in the picture
LOVE these shoes!!  Very cute *and* incredibly comfortable.  They're worth every penny.
Great Fit and material especially great wire free.
Fits great. Looks great. So look comfortable. I've ordered several different colors. A perfect summer skirt with a loose long sleeve shirt or a snug shirt sleeve. Great price also.
Cloth is nice and smooth with the weave tight. You can tell it is good quality and feels it. The colors are great not to strong. Just good quality handkerchief .
"They are very beautifully and you get a lot for the price. However after 2 days of wearing one color the top crystal fell out, but I just replaced that with another color so I didn't mind for the price I paid."
beautiful tennis shoes.. I just ordered the wrong size :(
I hate shopping for clothes online since most come from China and run way too small. I ordered this and it fits true to size. Long enough to wear with leggings. Very soft. Love it!
Nice for my husband who has swollen feet and ankles
Super soft and love that it has pockets
OMG you just can beat the price and the product! Can't wait to wear it for my European vacation! ( didn't get the chance to iron it)
"I bought these because they are festive and match all of her party dresses. Although the heel is high (3""), there' s a 1/2"" platform which makes them comfier to wear, plus there's a cushion in the insole. High back supports the ankles. They fit true to size and my little one just can't get enough of them. Now my oldest one is jealous that the shoe does not go up to size 7.
Just wish they came in more colors, like pine green for the holidays."
It fits well.. And very stylish
"Nice light, well built. But it is not compatable with my feet."
"I have had this for more than a year, I think. I really like it! It was inexpensive but does not look or feel cheap and has plenty of features. It is a pretty blue, comfortable, and has yet to show any scratches or marks. I have used it while swimming in a pool and at the beach and while playing moderate intensity sports. Perfect for a casual or sports watch."
"great in the snow, I feel secure walking, figured out I could slip them on and off w/o unlacing most of the time. works w/ skinny jeans or leggings and warm w/o having to wear heavy sox. i highly recommend and hope to have many years of use!"
"Titanium, while a metal, is slightly darker than you would expect from most metals including white Gold or stainless steel. Titanium metal is inherently darker than the silvery metals, however when polished, it exhibits a very pleasing appearance that is very beautiful and close to the color of stainless steel with a highly translucent over tint. Now, being Titanium, it will be resistant to any deterioration from most common and many uncommon substances it may come into contact with during the day. I like the look of polished Titanium, and it's certainly worth a try at this very attractive price."
"You get what you pay for.
*Paint peeling off as shown in picture."
Bought this for my to wear during the holiday season and at a great price. I can't wait to put them on her
"Purchased these for my daughter, who is a CNA, and she loves them. She likes the softness and the pockets. The sizing seems true, and the quality is nice, especially for the cost. We will be ordering more."
"Love there very casual, comfortable sneakers. Price was reasonable and delivery was very quick. These are not shoes to wear for hiking or very active activities but for relaxing and just being comfortable they are great. I will buy more. I have narrow feet and this shoe fits me so if you have wide feet they may not be the shoes for you. They fit true to length."
I really like them. They are soft and very comfortable to wear.
Very nice totes umbrella but would have preferred a color or print instead of just black but it's fine
It runs small.  It fits tightly.  I like it though.  Great quality.
Love these shoes!!! They are really comfortable and super cute too!!
"Very good quality, bright colors and comfortable."
"Love this dress. form fitting, sexy yet formal, zipper lets you be as naughty or as nice as you wish to be."
"I love this bra! I bought three in different colors. I've had them for a while and they still look great. They launder well, true to color, comfy, and hold the girls up nicely. I'm a B cup so can't say how they'd do for larger cup sizes, but they do seem to be made well. I would definitely buy again."
"Had an issue with usps shipping but Amazon and Trayvax customer service made it right quickly.  Love the wallet!  I've been hunting for a while and tried about a dozen diffrent designs and make ups but this one takes it.  Easy secure access and holding of cash and cards. Very rugged, comfortable and cool. I've been showing it off and recommending it to everyone I see struggling with too many bills and cards. Give up the leather and flaky flimsy money clips.  Don't think just buy and be amazed and never have to buy another wallet again.

Update 10/5/16:
Still the last wallet you'll ever need. I swear these guys should hire me as a salesman. I'm in retail and see hundreds of people with bad leather wallets, paper clips, binder clips holding 15 cards and stacks of bills. I so them pull my Trayvax axis out and send them to your site. I get stopped by people all the time what's that?  And I just smile because I love this wallet. I think I sold 3 wallets Sunday at the paintball field. I expected thr paracord to wear tear and snap but no wear. The little snap holding it all together still strong."
very authentic looking
I love it. I really like this suit but it fit too small :( If u have more then a B cup don't waste your time getting it.
"Fits great, and nice quality.  I think these will hold up for a long time.  The elastic waist feels like it will hold up well and goes on easily over diapers.  I like the weight of the fabric.  Not too thin or heavy.  This way, my granddaughter can wear them in the spring and fall as well as in winter in the mild Carolina's."
These are really neat and I love them however not necessarily for my ear. It falls off after some time if I hadn't already taken it off from the way it just bothers my ear
"I buy Lee's for my grandson because he is in between sizes. They fit him perfect, no sagging for him. He's 6 years old. There is only one other place that still sells the extended waist for his size."
This was a gift for the hubby b cause his old one was worn out and he badly needed a new one. Got it today and he loves it. Has a lot more spaces for cards and an easy view for his drivers license
These appear to be good t shirts.  I'll probably buy more.  Maybe I should have rated them 5 stars.  (Haven't washed them yet....)
Well made - wife loves it!
"Good socks,"
It is a must buy
"I ordered these to wear on an extended trip instead of a small pair of my late grandmother's pearl earrings, which I would hate to lose because of their sentimental value. I am extremely impressed with these button pearls and the packaging they came in -- it's a pretty good indication of a company's dedication to customer service when a product that barely costs $10 comes in a velvet gift box further enclosed in a wrappable white box. The pearls themselves are dainty and quite a bright white, and the posts look to be well set. The clasps fit well to the posts, and there was also a pair of small plastic backers included in the velvet box for those who want to make sure the earrings won't go anywhere.

I look forward to wearing these on my trip and upon my return! I will certainly look at Quality Jewels' products again."
Very pretty. Perfect gift for my sister who loves sugar skulls and earrings!
I bought this jacket for backpacking in the mountains.  I needed something that would keep me warm if the weather temp dropped unexpectedly (which often happens) while not weighing my pack down.  I was basically only concern with function not fashion.  I like this jacket so much I'd wear it to work or going out etc.
"This is the perfect tennis shoe for me.  It's light weight, has great traction, the upper is soft so it has a snug fit and doesn't require any break-in.  It's not as supportive as some other shoes (like the Gel-Resolutions), so if you need that, this might not be the shoe for you, but if you're looking for light weight, these are outstanding.

Be warned, these shoes (as all the Asics tennis shoes do, in my experience) run big.  I wear a size 10 in every other shoe I buy, but I always buy 9 1/2 in Asics tennis shoes, and these are no exception."
"Very durable, and a little on the heavy side"
"These are great.  A little big, but SUPER comfy"
"I work anywhere from 45 to 60 hours a week standing for all of it as a salaried manager with Pizza Hut. Being on my feet walking and standing on hard cement and tiled floors means im hard on my feet and ankles. With these my foot pain and most of my ankle pain has subsided.

These shoes meet the requirements we have for shoes, black, closed toe, and non slip. Also I like the rubber construction, for cleaning I spray down the inside and outside with a generic bathroom cleaner when I get home and they still look and smell decently since doing this. For me this is a big plus knowing they're clean."
"These glasses have held up for about a year of continual use. I keep them in the sunglasses holder in my car so that I can put them on while driving.

I have always been a fan of the full-mirror, and they look pretty stylish (the mirror looks like it is starting to wear off on mine).

I'm really bad about breaking sunglasses, so these were a cheap solution to an expensive problem. No more beating myself over the head over broken Oakleys or Ray-Bans!"
"It is good quality and warm, fit my husband well"
"I am a 5 ft. 1in. petite asian female, and got the small. It fits good, will probably give you some form of camel toe, and the torso feels a bit tight (Im a 32b). It came in the mail pretty fast though."
"Excellent looking glasses, not as orange as in the picture, more copper color. Very nice!"
The scarf is so beautiful! The colors are very vibrant and it's exactly what I wanted. I have gotten so many compliments.  The large size is perfect.
Very happy with these Gel Aspics
"Beautiful masculine rosary bought for a young man's confirmation gift. Great quality, would buy again!"
I like the thickness and it feels very comfortable. Will buy again.
"This is a good looking shoe that will do nicely with a suit, or business casual. The dark brown color is perfect to stay current but not be trendy by being too light in color. The cap toe look is sleek and not overdone.  The heel is a little on the wide side but looks ok. The sole silhouette is nice in that it does extend out just a bit. These elements make the shoe look sturdy.  But...this is not high quality upper ""leather"" and the sole is synthetic. The leather on this pair looked a bit shiny and I will have them polished to mat it down a bit. I was not expecting to buy anything close to the Alden and Allen Edmond shoes I own, but these Steve Madden's do look great for a fraction of their cost.

However, I know from experience these shoes will not last, and maybe they're not supposed to since I bought this exact pair on clearance for $40 from Macy's in January this year.  They lasted exactly 9-months before the right heel cracked in half where it meets the sole. I wore this shoe every other day, never in the rain and always used shoe trees. To make matters worse I was quoted anywhere from $50 to $65 from neighborhood shoe repair shops to have them resoled with new heels!  I bought the shoe for $67.99 on Amazon this time and now sadly know and fully expect this shoe will barely get me through the spring of 2016.  Such is the fact for buying shoes made in China."
"Comfy and dressy looking.  I have these in both navy and black,"
"Lovely feminine cut, and stylish.  Great to be able to get sufficient leg length that when in the saddle they still stay down at your heels.  Very comfy and wash up like new.  The stretch in the fabric is fantastic - they spring back to shape after a wash and dry.  I have two pairs now and will buy again I'm sure."
"I bought a pair of Bostonian Flex Lites about 5 years ago when I had to find dress shoes that worked for standing all day. I can't say enough about the comfort level of these shoes. I would rather wear these shoes than any tennis shoe I've ever worn. I have to wear these in an industrial environment, so concrete or steel floors and I can stand/walk around for 8 hours with little discomfort compared to any other shoe I've worn in the past. Highly recommended.

The only complaint I have about this particular pair is the color. This is the 2nd pair of Brown Wenham's I've purchased, and the 2nd pair is a much, much darker shade of brown than the first pair and I selected exactly the same options on here as I did the first. So expect a little variance in color from the picture."
"I took it to my optician and they carry designer brands for sale there, and the sales man viewed it and took the serial number and checked it out for me, its legit, I'm happy , it feels durable, I love the rubber matte feel it has , I will give it to my husband for Fathers day."
"I am a 38D/31/40 figure, 5'4"" and usually wear a size 10-12 depending on brand. I was having a hard time deciding on a size L or an XL, so I went with a L and it fit perfectly. I love the material, not too thick, not too thin, nice a stretchy to show off the curves If you are shorter, then it might be longer than you like and considered more for a ""conservative"" gals date night. I wish it had been about 2"" shorter ( I can always hymn it) but i am shorter, and in between average/curvy and do not have a models long legs. I consistently get compliments whenever I wear this dress and plan to buy more."
"I offered this for part of my babys Halloween costume. The color was vibrant, the fit great, and the over all quality was very nice."
I'm 5'4 150 lbs. I initially bought this dress in a size medium but it fit a bit loose so I decided to order a small  to compare the fit. I ended up keeping the small as i prefer a fitted look. I wore the dress to a wedding this weekend and received a ton of compliments. The material was soft and light weight. The dress was very comfortable and elegant. I would definitely recommend this product.
"Good shirt, but certainly not even a true XXL, much less ""relaxed fit"".  I wanted some roome for a thermal or fleece under, but not with as small as they run.  They are the heavier twill from Carhartt, the picture doesn't show the weight.  Still a good shirt, just not what I was expecting."
Beautiful and exactly what I was looking for to go with my dress.  Got lots of compliments!!
Great pair of shoes. The Stone color is a grear neutral color
Because i love the wallet exactly what i wanted size and plenty of credit card slots its worth the price..;-)
Husband likes it but we thought the watch face would be a little larger.
On time and It's beautiful. Came in a velvet pouch. I would order from them again. Fix it bracelet and it Isn't a Pandora.
"Cute, cute! Definitely buy!"
seem good for the money. will have to see how they hold up to washing.
"This bra is underwire, with a lot of comfort, style and support. Soft material within cups for added comfort. Recommend to any woman who wants support and comfort, along with a few ""frills."""
These are awesome shorts.  Look good.  Quick drying.  Comfy and lightweight.  My new favorite hiking shorts.
It's a great fit and is very comfortable I'm wearing it a lot.
"Wow, these are my new favorite boots! I treated them with Obenauf's and buffed them the next day and they darkened up a nice shade (I got the brown ones) and these have a very cushiony insole and a roomy toe box.  Generally I prefer wide footwear because I have sensitive does, and these just happen to naturally be wide enough to not cause any pinching of the toes. The instep is slightly loose, but I think it might be the reason they are called ""relaxed fit"".  As such, these may not be idea for extended hikes off road, as your foot will likely slide around a bit inside the shoe, but for winter wear and cold weather, they are perfect for my needs. You aren't going to want to walk through very deep snow or anything that is anke keep, as liquid will pass through the goring and into the inside of the boot.  But, if you are going to the mall on a winter day and you have to deal with a little snow and slush and then walk for miles inside a mall, you will really appreciate them and their softness and cushioning.  The memory form is nice for retaining warmth too and shielding you from the cold ground. This is my second pair of Skeckers and have to admit that I never gave the brand any consideration until I got the first pair of slip on shoes last year that also have the memory foam and they became my go-to shoes for easy on access and comfort, and I have been impressed with the way they have worn in and that the sole is not wearing down like other shoes I have tried.  So these seem rugged and comfortable and I think you'll enjoy them if you want cushioning and ease of donning. I recommend Obenaufs or some other waterproofing for extended durability and protection."
"I LOVE this sandal and have worn it so often since it arrived a few months ago. It is very comfortable and really looks great with a dress or capris. I packed them for a recent vacation and it went with every outfit; received many compliments, too. Would love them in another color for next season!"
"This was just what I wanted. Pretty, without being too ornate. The weighted base makes it perfect for heavy stone jewelry, no tipping."
Soft. Durable. Awesome to wear and inexpensive.  5 stars
"I work in a job that has me on my feet all day long, so these are wonderful. They are comfortable and they breathe. I have  them in every color."
"It was a pretty dress my daughter loves it, its a bit tight around the waist but otherwise good, I would buy again but this time one size larger than her regular size."
"They're just what I wanted
  Thanks"
After about 9 years my original jungle moc's finally needed replacing.  Glad I was able to still find them!
perfekt fit
"my daughter love this top , she recommend it to any one who loves to belly dance or just loves to dress for outdoor concerts and have fun . delivery was on time ."
"Perfect for now , adorable dress,wish it was  1nch longer so my daughter could have it over the summer. In the fall it will be too short"
"The pants were large and the shirt fit as expected.  That being said, the pants and suspenders were so freaking adorable that we just paired it with a better fitting shirt for a wedding and he looked perfect.  Long legs were easy to hem.  My 21 month old fit the 12 month size pants, with an inch taken off the bottom.  The shirt in the 18 month size fit better, but the pants were too large."
"Excellent sizing! I love the wait on these pants it sits just below my belly button, so it sucks my belly fat right in very comfortably. I love how these come in petite! I'm 5'3 and I always have roll my pants or have them hemmed with these I don't even if I am wearing flat shoes. They look very professional as well. The only downside is that these don't have buttons, it's the slider hook thing but it is sewed on very well. Also the material is quiet thin. For the Dickies brand I was expecting a much thicker pant. I would repurchase these again."
"This thing is sweet. Great quality, awesome fit and it was at my door in less than a week."
very comfortable.  nice soft material.
These are solid boots and stand up well to an active 4yr old who loves splashing in puddles! They are easy for her to get on and run in.
"Bought this for the GF for her Birthday as she's always borrowing my PFG stuff when we fish in Central America. Now she has a few of these and really enjoys them. They are light, breathe well and protect you from UV Rays.

Thanks!"
I love them they look so cute on him. Easy to clean and the style is so cute. The color white goes with everything.
"Works great, never worry about shirt tail riding up."
"I have been wearing New Balance for many many years.
They look great and feel great and I can put my orthotic in them."
Fits well but still grates the heels without some sort of insert
These shoes are surprisingly comfortable.  You would never know they were steel toed!  I haven't walked around in them all day yet but they are very light weight and look cute.
Love it! Fits perfectly. I wore it this past weekend and I got so many compliments.
"In my teenagers words...""LOVE, LOVE,LOVE!"""
Exactly what was needed for Tux
Great quality. Great seller!
"These are super comfortable and really soft for jeans. Beyond that they are a little tight around my big legs, the fit is great. They will stretch a bit after a few hours of wear. I wear a 34x34 and these are just the right size. The color is a dark blue and the zipper matches the color. This is a nice feature as most zippers are gold and often make it look as if my fly is open when it is not.  All the expected features of a pair of jeans with good sized pockets and that little coin pocket that I use for my fab."
"Considering this cost two bucks, it's the best thing ever. It's really cute and the sizing is actually accurate. I always buy slightly larger when I see something cheap so I ordered a medium, and I could have gone with a small. The medium isn't too. Big though, it's comfortably loose."
"These are cozy, fit well, cute but a bit ""clunky looking"""
"Pretty, warm and easy to wear."
"This is a very comfortable hoodie t shirt, but definitely not for cold weather. I use it for the gym, and it's perfect for that. And possible summertime/evening wear. Even ordered a second one days after receiving this one.

And for the price? A no-brainer."
"Absolutely in love with this dress on my daughter. It is a very flattering fit, even with her extra bit of belly still. The colors are much brighter than pictured, would make a great ""Hawaiian"" dress."
"I love the shirt , just a few caveats and that is the 2 buttons on the neck are ridiculous they are so hard to button and the buttons on the collar are for skinny ties not the thick one that comes with the shirt. The real pain was trying to get the tiny pins out of the shirt that keeps it folded.  Outside of those little pains the shirt itself is absolutely great."
Really like these! I bought them because they are the same material as the Exofficio Travel Underwear at a fraction of the price! Will be back for more.
...although I wouldn't have known what size to use if it weren't for already owning a pair of identical shoes.
Loved them on my trip. 3 stars instead of 4 because 1 came missing a top so I could only use 2  No time to return for new ones before my trip.
Great hat.  I will use it for years to come.
"Well Ladies, I love the boots and so do my girl and guy friends. I wear between a size 6-1/2 to 7 and the 7 was a bit tight on my right foot but to their defense, I had surgery and perhaps that foot was a bit snug. I would not go up one size because then they may be to big. ENJOY because I sure did!!!"
This is a perfect purse. The only issue that I would have is the top where you zip it closed is manufactured strangely to me. It doesn't actually zip from one end to the other. This doesn't change my mind about it. It is a great purse!
They feel snug for a size 8 but I am sure they will stretch.
Great for when your baby outgrows the length of onesie sets but not the pants. The fabric is soft and its nice to not have to worry about if the onesie is true to size
This wrap is nice.  Love this.
Purchased for a gift and I think they will like this a lot. Very stylish.
"My mother loved this shirt. It fits her well. I got her a large and she's about 5'3"" maybe 165 lb. The material is great, not cheap at all. It came intact and I was tempted to keep it for myself"
I love this swimsuit. It fits perfectly. It covers the areas I don't like showing. I feel beautiful and confident wearing this at the pool. I highly recommend it. I am going to purchase another.
Product arrived promptly and husband loves it!!!
I love the color and fit of this Dashiki would recommend it to anyone.
"Such a smart design with zipped pockets, alternative entryways and expandable! Plus I think its warranted for at least a decade -- what's not to love?"
I wear it all the time love it ^_^
"Exactly what I needed for overnight trips! It is a great size -- toiletry case, hairdryer, one or two sets of clothes, etc. I love the camo with pink. . . Bought the luggage set to match and a tiny train case too. Good quality at a good price. Recommend."
Love these crocasins....better than boots because they just slip on.  They are made well and quite a bargain for the price.  A little narrow but very comfortable.
"I got these about three months ago, the arrive was non to much of a wait. I ordered the anchor design, i couldn't help myself and the price was worth it. Though after three months they begin to wear (of cores) And i like them better then my Converse, they are much more easier and faster to put on, and match all my outfits! The only thing was, me. I don't have socks for these types of shoes, im also low of money so the ones i find are expensive or out of my reach. And under the fabric is of cores rubber, and it get hot. And my feet sweat quite a bit in them. The fabric (you can tell) is just simple glue connecting it to the rubber. And if you have sweaty feet with no socks they will wear out faster and the fabric will become detached. And that's what happened to mine.... But im differently not going to throw them away anytime soon, just need a replacement..."
Fits good totally worth it
Exactly what I needed. The compact design can be both a blessing
I love mud pie
I am so glad I chose this pair of Yellow Gold Plated Silver Celtic Design Oval Dangle Earrings. They are so comfortable to wear and they look really good on my ears.
I am very please with this wallet!
material runs thin.
I love these sneakers.  They are cushiony and comfortable.  I also have them in black and pink.  I do not wear them to the gym I like them for a casual sneaker to wear on casual Fridays.
They took a month to get to me but they were worth the wait!
Perfect fit and the most comfy pant I have bought in years!!!
The photo does not do this watch justice. It looks bulky in the picture but in person is much more smooth.  The color is beautiful.  I am very happy with this purchase.
smooths you out
"Excellent fit, holds well, love the support and washes great without losing it's shape and fit."
True to size and Sexy/Classy all in one! Originally purchased for a wedding (red shoes for bridesmaids) and since then I wore them for a Halloween party and the color is perfect with simple highwaisted jeggings and black top. Perfect pop of color :)
Very comfortable shoes with good arch support. Better than the Nike ones that I paid more for. I'm very happy with the purchase.
"I was concerned when I first got them because they squeezed my pinky toe a bit, but after wearing these for a solid 20 minutes, they have completely embraced my foot & are incredibly comfortable!"
"It's a really solid, comfortable, well-made pack. It's bigger than it looks and a great deal of modular attachment points for other Maxpedition products."
Shoe was tight at first but thats all new shoes. The shoes are broken in feels great.
this will be my 2nd pair...last pair lasted 5 years. beautiful shoe.
So comfortable and warm. Now my kids and grandkids want one because it is so soft.
"I love this dress, ready to rock it on my birthday  Fits perfectly on me. Might end up buying again but in a different color."
A little long but I trimmed it to a desirable length.
Bought it for my son's birthday -love it!!
"I bought the black chevron pattern. The quality of the bag is wonderful and it's perfect for a carryon. As other reviewers stated, it does have a bit of a smell when you first get it, but it quickly went away."
love these wore first day for whole 12 hour shift
"I Bought a Size Large, and I couldve boughten a medium, I was worried about them being to tight around the waist, I Am a size 7/8.
Also, 5'3 and they hit mid calf, which doesn't bother me.
The pocket is maybe an inch and a half wide, so unable to put my phone in it! But the material is great, super stretchy, but not so stretchy that it is see thrust. Would deaf buy again!"
Sparkles nicely. Not gaudy for fake. Band a little thick for total comfort. Size is slightly larger than true size. Boxed pretty. Will wear. Would make nice gift even to yourself!
Looks hilarious
"Great support and balanced tightness, easy to put on and take off!"
Great quality. Very warm
"Night sweats from menopause made cotton jammies a necessity. Union suits absorb a lot of sweat, don't twist into a knotted nightmare and make sleeping through the night a possibility. And they work great for cold weather; wow double duty, can't go wrong. I'm 5'8"" 120 lbs, a medium fits perfect"
My husband & I dress up every Halloween. We bought this ghostly gent costume and the female equivalent one year and won first prize in a costume contest!
"They are kind of snug and make my feet look like a tied pork roast, but I'm going to give it a little bit to stretch because the bottoms feel like heaven."
"No complaints on this product - I own 4 pairs of Frye boots and it did make my brown boots darker, but I would rather have them protected from water damage than not, so I am happy!"
"good shorts, no complaints"
"I honestly don't know how anyone can look at a ring like this-- especially the center stone-- and care whether or not it's a ""real"" diamond or a Swarovski Zirconia. The end result is the same: A beautiful ring. If you want that diamond look without the diamond price or diamond legacy, then you'll be pleased with what you get here.

The main stone is quite beautiful, as clear stones go. The setting is simple but elegant. The platinum-plated sterling silver ring itself looks great, and feels durable enough, though the insert can be bent if you apply some pressure. The two rings lock together to make a nice set, but honestly, the ""main"" ring is pretty enough to stand on its own.

I'm not the biggest fan of the marketing and legacy of diamonds, so for me this seems like a much better compromise. It's beautiful, and except for a few people who are experts at such things, the naked eye won't know you're not wearing a very attractive diamond."
I bought this as a gift for a friend. Her sisters loved it so I order some more for them. They loved it! awesome gift idea!
"Comfortable, with durable stitching and sturdy soles."
"This is the second pair of FitFlop I own.  I was looking for a pair with about 2 inches height to wear in the house.  My feet are not fully recovered yet from 17-day walk in Paris/London a month ago.  I wore ""Arche"" sandals as recommended by lots of (online) people, however it did not provide enough coushion for my feet for daily 6-8 hours of wallk.  So now I have to wear shoes that provide thick cushion and flexibility.  Fitflop is what I want to try ... it has really cool design these two years.  The first pair is Fitflop Arena sandals (greatly love). Both Arena and Lulu are very comfortable: enough room for my toes, perfect height and flexible footbed for my achy feet/toes.  I certainly will look for the third pair (as house slipper) when temperature drops.  My feet width are normal, I usually wear US size 6.5 or 7.  I had tried FitFlop in person at a store to decide the right size for me and 7 is good (size 6 is not long enough)."
"Super comfy, wear to work all the time. I work in a restaurant and am standing for 8-12 hrs a day and still find these to be just as comfy by the end of the day (i do put inserts in all my shoes though). They are definitely not made to wear in weather which i knew and im sad i have bc they leak around the seams and i don't want to loose these staples!"
Worked great for my sailor Mars costume ! Only thing was the jewel fell off very easily and had together back on! I'd suggest taking rubber banding off of the back because it pulls your hair. Came packaged nicely and safe.
Perfect for over pants to play in the rain. Keeps him dry!
They fit a little bit smaller than expected.  The problem is that the laces are too short to make the knots.
Granddaughter wants all Paw Patrol.  Shoes were a great fit and quality.
Great button!
I bought up a size so I could slip these pants on over whatever my son was wearing.  A simple thin pant great for rain resistance in warm climates.  Want to order another pair but Amazon no longer seems to carry the toddler sizes.
"I gave it as a ANGEL TREE GIFT, I never got to see the person wear it"
"My three boys love this umbrella and fight over it.  I may have to purchase 2 more!!!  As a parent, what I love most about this umbrella is that it has a plastic protection against the pointy clasp, so it doesn't hurt the child.  This is such a nice, well thought out product... not to mention very cute and artsy!"
My daughter loves these. They are very fluffy and warm inside. I sprayed them again with weather protector so can't speak to how waterproof they are on their own.
I bought an US 'S'; Asia M Gray shirt. It fits great in my slim body. I'm 5'8'' and it's just like made for me. The shirt design is outstanding!
"I've been using a slim leather wallet I also purchased off Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alpine-Swiss-Money-Clip-Genuine-Leather-Super-Thin-Slim-Cash-Strap-Wallet-Black/dp/B00EOYKEEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alpine Swiss Money Clip Genuine Leather Super Thin Slim Cash Strap Wallet Black</a>&nbsp;which has served me very well. I don't carry many cards on me so the thinner the wallet the better. However, the leather has started to stretch and unless I keep that leather wallet full of cash, the cards fall out of it very easily.

So I decided to expand my comfort level and go with a non-leather wallet for the first time because let's be honest, 'carbon fiber' just sounds way cooler than leather. And I was provided an opportunity to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion so here goes:

I have been using this for over a week and very pleased with the size and construction. I gave the pockets a good tug to see if the seams would stretch but they held taut. The carbon fiber material itself is a bit glossy, but the dark grey is attractive and nowhere near as loud as a glossy leather wallet. I have no idea if the RFID shielding works but as my credit card was recently copied and used at a gas station across the country, every bit of security helps.

Pros:
- Provides easy access to 4 cards and storage on both sides for several more
- Carbon fiber body is very lightweight and visually appealing
- Well-made and sturdy

Cons:
- This wallet won't expand too much and the middle pocket for cash can be hard to open, even moreso if you're carrying more than 6 cards. I have to leave my cash slightly exposed so it makes it easier to pull out

Overall I'm very pleased with this wallet although it is a bit difficult to access the cash pocket. That said, I don't use cash a whole lot these days so having easy access to my credit cards is more beneficial. Definitely recommend this wallet if you're looking for something slim, well-made, and eye-catching.

Returned this item. Fits a little tight around my foot.  I did love the shade of brown. I also liked that this shoe came in a variety of nice colors.
Arms are good. A bit bigger than size chart. Should have gone a size smaller.
"I got the green bag, and thought it was beautiful to begin with, but it's somehow even more gorgeous in person. I was looking for a large bag that would be good for traveling (basically a tote, but shape didn't matter as much as quality + appearance + capacity). I put this on my wishlist and kept looking for totes, but nothing compared to how much I love this bag, so I finally caved and ordered it, and I am so happy I did. It's not quite as big as I was hoping (this is because I'm not good at visualizing sizes, not because any info was inaccurate, to be clear lol), but it will definitely serve its purpose. I love it so much I've already just switched all my purse contents to it now, but this will be great for carrying with me to tours of ruins and museums in Mexico, and wherever we go for a fee weeks in Germany. This brand is tops, seller is great, and this particular bag is absolutely stunning. If you think it looks good on the photos, it'll knock your socks off once you see it in person lol."
I don't use it for keeping coins since I already have a coin purse. It is very good at keeping ear buds organized. There's also room for other small items -- I keep a headphone jack adapter in it too.
The quality is not good ... I paid a good price ... but i seen for $30 to $40 and that's crazy ... $50 you can get a real one from the natives
I bought these cuff-links for my future son-in-law.  The are small but beautiful.  I can't wait to give them to him.
Good sweatshirt. Decent quality.
"I measured my finger according to the size chart and this ring fits me perfectly. I wear it every single day!! I receive tons of compliments, and honestly the ring looks even better in person than it does online. I wear it next to a real diamond and platinum ring and it honestly holds it own next to a piece that cost several thousand. I'm a huge fan of opals and this one is so lovely and iridescent. I will more than likely be ordering more jewelry from this company in the future!!"
Belt is a little high waisted. Mother-in-law took care of that! Great robe for the money! I've had these in hotels that wanted $150.00!
"I bought these for my father who loves not having to battle with shoelaces, particularly when traveling.  The are comfortable and great looking"
Softest jeans I've ever worn.  Fit as expected.  Seem to stay up though haven't washed yet.  They are nice and long for ankle length - better than some others I tried. And oh so slimming - I put them on and realized what a GOOD pair of jeans can do for you.  These are amazing. And did I mention SOFT?
Perfect for what they are intended.
"The Via Spiga coat/jacket is just right for me.  The fit, the fabric, the tailoring, and the camel color were better than I expected.  I am a taller person (5'9"") and can sometimes have problems with sleeve length and the waist being too short...not this time.  In the image the sleeves look somewhat short, but the sleeves on my coat fall below the wrist, just what I need.  The waist and length are ideal for my (Misses) body type.  I wear a size small in tops (6-8) but like a 10 in a winter coat to fit over heavier, thicker clothes.  This one will do it.  Maybe I should mention that I live in NC where the winters are not usually harsh.  Regardless, this will be a warm coat even when the temperatures are abnormally cold in my area.  I can't say enough good things about this coat.  If you want or need a new/updated coat or jacket, I recommend you try Via Spiga Outerwear."
Keeps time perfectly.  The only problem I've had is that the pink is rubbing off of that band .
Great backpack.  Has a lot of pockets.  My son is 15 and loves it.
At 2.5 my son has a strong opinion on shoes. He loves these and they are very comfortable. I bought wide and I may purchase extra wide. He isn't that big but with socks they do look a little tight.
Fun and easy shoe for my toddler to wear! After only a handful of uses the glitter starts to wear off around the toe and sides.
Looked very nice and well worth the money
"Nice fabric, good rich color and good long tail and sleeves, very pleased with the shirt"
Lovely pair of shoes.  They are soft and easy to put on and take off. My niece loved them.
Saucony has consistent quality
"These Brown Three Flower Squeaky Shoes are so cute and seem well made, even if they did not squeak they are adorable shoes. My granddaughter loved them she is 2 years old, I bought her a size 8. She is into everything so these shoes are great for her mommy to keep an eye or ear on where she is and what she is up to. She really gave them a work out when first putting them on, running around the house squeaking up a storm. So it is good that they are removable squeakers and that they come with a pair of replacement squeakers. Especially since she broke one the first ten minutes of play, but as I said she really gave them a work out. Her daddy did find a pack of reasonably priced replacement squeakers on Amazon that should work in the shoes. Will be ordering them when the ones that came with the shoes are all broken. If not for this problem I would give them 5 stars. Your little ones will love these shoes!"
These shoes are cute and funky. I love them. Something different for an older senior.
So many pockets for sorting things and making them easy to find.
I did buy a size larger in width and that was a good idea.  I read the other reviews and that is where I got the info on the size.  The sandals fit well and are comfortable and look very nice.
sons loves
The quality of Hanes underwear is good.
LOVE everything about this bag.  Truly red!  Quality leather.
This tanking is perfect! Loved the colours and fit is perfect.
"I ordered khaki, the color seems to be more of a brown but they look and fit fine."
OTHER REVIEW WAS RITE!!!!!!!  LOOOOOT'S  OF BLING  NICE WATCH.....
"I LOVE THEM. I'm 5'2"", 145lb, and I bought a large.  I'm pretty hip/butt heavy so this size fit me really well.  They are super long but that's ok they're comfy and I just roll them up."
Very cute.  I dress it up and down.  Great fit.  Arrived on time and fun to wear.
runs a full size larger- which is why i kept it.  very flattering shape!
Nice design and color. The back is a bit annoying on one sandal as the seam seems to rub my ankle.
"This top was part of the order I placed and received, I didn't get my entire order, but I did get this top and it fits great, it is very nice."
This is someting you would wear for a walk to the park or the quick run to that grocery store. It will last one season for sure...
Super cute!  One of my favorites!
perfect fit!  love these
"I LOVED this sweater.  I needed an ugly sweater and I needed it fast.  This product arrived in two days, no problem (yes I have prime but other sweaters couldn't arrive as quickly for some reason) and was ready to wear (meaning no weird smells or stiffness).  It also fit perfectly. I'm on the shorter side (5'1), average build and a medium was just right.  Very happy with my purchase."
"This dress is so cute and chic on! The fabric is a good quality and has stretch to it. I'm a 12/14 and I ordered a 2x just to be safe....an XL would have fit fine, but I don't mind it being a bit on the loose side! The lace is a nice quality, also has stretch. Length is at about my knee and I'm 5'3. I really love this dress- it has the classy look that I can wear to work or on a date night with my husband. I recommend it!!"
I seldom write a personal review but I was very impressed with the quality and the price of this suite.  I bought the 14/16 size and it fits perfectly.  Very flattering to my expanding body.
"I swear by Kamik boots so when my grandson picked these out, even though his size was not available, I purchased them.  He's only going to continue to grow so he'll wear them, eventually."
This gown was nice quality for the price. It look very nice. I will have to have it cut off and hemed because I am short.
Oh Geez!!! wonderful. going to buy more colors!!! A must have.
My husband is a tow trucker and these boots are perfect. He's very happy with them. GREAT BUY!
"Comfy, comfy, comfy!!! Need I say more?"
Fun to wear and the most comfortable of shoe.  They make your feet happy! Unique way of lacing up these great shoes.
Love this brand and these sandals are so comfortable.
"So comfy, if you are someone who trips easily i would be cautious....I got caught up on the baggy part below when wearing flip flops and trying to run. I love these though."
Very lightweight and great for diaper bag organization.
Gorgeous and good quality!
"I like this wallet thin, fits in front or back pocket. like the color and style, a little longer than i thought."
Great material fits well... tad bit big but overall good product!
"It was a great shoes, very comfortable and it looks very expensive, the price was ok and quality fabric was good. I recommend it"
"Cozy, dries pretty quickly. 5'10"" 165lbs, fits well."
"Estan bien cmodas, lo nico malo es que la suela no estn anti resbaladiza, bueno para las personas que tienen problemas para encontrar zapatos confortables"
IT'S AWESOM
"bought these for my wife, she has a necklace that is similar, they are just the right size and look great."
"Very thin fabric but not too ""clingy"".  Light weight is good for avoiding overheating.  Wicks moisture well.  Color holds up well and the heather is a nice change for workouts.  Tee is long enough to avoid exposing midsection when lifting overhead or bending down."
Love this coat! Fits our 5 year old well. A bit long in the sleeves but overall very nice. Not very bulky but keeps him super warm!!
"Unique design for the JD lover!  Runs a little small, but still very nice."
I liked that the shoe was leather. Very comfortable.
"Surprisingly comfortable! I wore them for a few hours for the first time, they feel good right out of the box. I felt a little sensitive across the toes from the outer edge of the strap, but the leather is soft and I'm sure it will get even softer as I wear them more. Very attractive, very comfortable to walk in. I'm glad I bought them."
"I have a wide foot and ordered a wide width in these.  The width is great, but they were just a little bit longer than I expected.  Otherwise, the shoes are extremely comfortable and look great and are very versatile."
"Not wild about the purple pair that came with the set (because of course I go around in my underwear all the time, and purple just is not my color - just kidding), and having the tag on the outside front just seemed dumb at first. Maybe not - no stiff irritating tag on the inside at least. Anyway, they're underwear. They fit just fine and the fabric is comfortable. That's all I ask. 5 stars.
No, I won't be adding a photo."
Excellent for Michigan snow and very warm. These were a gift for my niece and she loves them.  She can hardly wait for the larger replacement to arrive.
This is my third pair of Steve Madden boots and I love these as much as the pairs I've worn out.  I wear either a size 7.5 or an 8 depending on the manufacturer and the 'fit'.  In Steve Madden boots I wear size 7.5.  Thanks.
"While I love this skirt and own several of the same in different colors, this one color would be better described as 'denim'. I wasn't too impressed with that lack of description, but it is not overly noticeable as faux denim. Still cute!"
"This is my third pair of this identical product and I hope they don't stop making it. Maybe I'm a creature of habit, but when I find something I like, I stick with it. I spend a lot of time on my feet at work and these shoes are comfortable to the point where the last thing I worry about is my feet after eight hours  of walking around. They do wear out. Nothing lasts forever, but what doesn't, right? I have only one very minor complaint. I wish the laces were longer. I tie a bit of a double knot to make sure they don't come undone and the provided laces are something like 1/2"" too short. I always have to replace them. Not a big deal. The comfort of the shoes more than makes up for this minor inconvenience."
"They fit well, and server their purpose. I can't really think of anything exceptionally good or bad about these."
so does Honey!!!
"Very comfortable, but could have a little more arch support."
This shirt is very comfortable and soft.  It is also kind given I'm a few pounds overweight.
This dress is so pretty and great quality. My daughter will be wearing it for a wedding as a Jr. Bridesmaid. My daughter is really thin but taller than the average 7 yr old. The size 6 was perfect on top but was a little short. It came to her knee instead of tea length.  I exchanged the 6 for an 8. It's a wide kind of dress so the top runs big if your little one is narrow like my daughter. She looks great though.  It's beautiful and will last her another year.
Nice but it has that weird warehouse smell... hoping that it will wash out but other than that Im pleased.
Right foot smaller than left
Great pair of shoes that fit quite well.  Unfortunately after about a year of wearing them BOTH soles cracked all the way across.  I have never seen a pair of shoes do that before.  Still they look great and seem to be ok other than being cracked on the sole.  They are wearing out a lot faster now because of the cracks so I will likely have to replace them sooner than I had planned.
Love these. I've been looking for other black sandals and these are them
Awesome shirt for my daughter
"Amazing, it looks so much better in person than in the picture. It is massive. Wish it came in more sizes."
"Cut is a bit small but that's the known fact for this line,,,based on the reviews I did go a size up and never regretted. The cut looks as though it was tailored for my son , even though the length was long ,it was fixed by simply ""darting "" the legs and the waist wasn't affected. Will purchase again even though it seems to attract lint....dry cleaning will be your best friend!"
"The stone was not as pink as I thought. It is a muted pink, but I still like it!"
So I didn't need a few more holes on the strap but once my shoe guy added 5 more it was just what I wanted. Great fit easy to wear all day long to work.
Great shoes. I like it
"This watch is classy and casual, ideal for any occasion. Slim and sleek it easily fits under a sleeve. The watch comes with a very big band, so you'll likely need to adjust the length. I was pleasantly surprised, that the item is sharper and more contrasting than shown in the image. This is a great watch for the unassuming individual.
Broke after 3 months. Skagen could not repair."
Good thickness and fit
Love these pants! Great quality!
"I like the fabric and the stylish look for this dress, but it is alot thinner than I thought.  Therefore, I rate it 4 out of 5 Stars."
Cool Shoes that compliment any shirt that is white or has a good portion of white in it. Love these kicks
Made a great stocking stuffer for the 13-year-old.
nice jeans. but need to take one size smaller
Nice watch. A bit bigger than expected.
Good quality product seems to work well.
"I really like these shoes - I ordered in a navy color, which is a true, deep navy. I also like that the foot bed is leather rather than the microfiber fabric that is inside some Clarks shoes - this seems to hold up much better. The only negative is that I have a very high arch, so some of the hook and loop closure is exposed in order to fit my foot. Doesn't really show, but it would be nice if the hook and loop band was a little shorter so that is was not exposed on the side of the shoe."
I do not like underwire bras and at a size 42D I find these bras to be just perfect. I also use these bras to exercise in.
"They were smaller than I expected, but I love the color. They are simple and cute."
Perfect fit.  Perfect price.
Love the colour of these shoes they look great as a casual shoe.  The backs do rub on the heel after a while though.
I bought this set for my mother in law and everybody liked it. Good price for what you get. It look a little cheap because doesn't have box.
"Great fit and super comfortable all day, even during rigorous workouts at the gym. I bought one set and loved them so much I bought 3 more!"
"My old pair of Old Friend slippers finally wore out and I bought these to replace them.  The style is the same, but the new ones have an improved replaceable insole with added support, and I like it. The fleece is thick and soft, warm in the winter and not hot in the summer.

I see a lot of people complaining about the size.  What you have to be aware of is that when you first put them on as new, they will feel small because the sheepskin is very ""fluffy"".  But after you wear them a couple of times, they'll compress in the right places and feel much better.  I know that the product title says ""Extra Wide"" but that seems to be because wide widths are available.  Order the size and width you want.  I'd say that the size runs true once broken in.  Of course, check the size stamped on the bottom of the sole to make sure you got what you ordered.

I have tried many different brands of sheepskin slippers, and keep coming back to Old Friend.

Edit: September 11, 2016

After six years, the pair I bought in 2010 wore out so I bought a new pair. Just as nice as the old ones."
"Long, fit well."
I am sure I read the reviews and did not listen. They fit great but I like tight jeans these are tight but if you are used to wearing skinny jeans buy a size down. I should have. I am keeping them and washing will probably work in hot h2o....nice tummy control and if you just wanted straight leg with a little room they are just perfect.
These boots are nice no scuff marks good material
"These sandals are for our toddler who is still too young for flip flop and does not like the feel of the sandals between his toes.  The adjustable velcro straps provide a secure fit and are easy on, easy off for busy feet."
"Comfortable, well-knit, and elegant. The biggest issue is that the buttons could be sewn on better, as they are starting to become loose after occasional wearing over the past 4 months."
absolutely love it gives me support I needed
"Totally cute.  Fits ""softer"" and more flexible than hard plastic ones.  Looks nicer too.  My toddler wears this around the house for play and the gemstone is still in tact."
A good quality shoe that fits my narrow feet very well.
"I usually purchase BOC shoes and am pleased with these. I wore them indoors a few days until the inner sole formed to my foot, then I wore them to work."
"Super long shoe laces.  You will have to either cut them, stuff them in the velcro, or purchase a shorter pair."
The best way to create the perfect sexy look for your  wild side.  Fit great
"Love these! Super lightweight and comfortable.  I don't like wearing them for running because for me there isn't enough support, but they are super cozy for my strength training days."
I love this purse. I need a larger purse to fit all my stuff in and this is perfect! Well made and no issues thus far!
I bought these for a new Mother and she loved them.  A very cute cover for diapers.  The Mom told me she wears them frequently.
"I have been using this bag for about 3 months now. Its adorable! The bag had a crease in it when first received but worked itself out after using for about a week. This is not big, but so much roomier than your average mini crossbody. The double outside pockets are so convenient for credit cards and cash. I am going to get more in other colors!"
"I really wanted to get a front close but supportive sports bra.  I looked at Victoria's Secret - and though I loved the bra, didn't feel like spending over $50 for it.  This bra may be a little less well made, but it is what I wanted and needed.  It certainly does the job and I am happy with it."
"These are the best underwear my son has tried. They are soft, thick, and fit well. They come in fun colors. He often complains about rough waistbands but these underwear have the waistband covered in fabric. He loves them. I will say that they fit on the small size--with cheaper types of underwear I was buying him smaller sizes (6 or 6-8) but these at size 8 fit him just right. I followed other reviewers' advice to order a size larger than usual and I'm glad I did. I will buy these again. Heck, I wish they made these for ladies and I'd buy them for myself."
Super cute!!! Great price and looks pretty under my dresses.
Good sweater.  It's warm and fluffy
Always a perfect fit! Love these :)
"This is my son's THIRD pair of Kovens. He's used them since he was about 2. And I keep getting bigger sizes.

Pros: if your kid has a WIDE foot, this is a great fit. So durable, these will last until your kid's foot won't fit anymore! Great front rubber ""cover"", he drags his toes so regular shoes rip so fast, these don't. Good grip. Good adjustable bungee laces. No ""breaking in"" phase. Fine for PE.

Cons: they are a bit chunky if your kid has a problem with that. Not super light. I had to replace the bungee laces about 6 mo in.

Well worth it."
Bought this to extend the length of the necklace I gave my stepdaughter for Christmas. I loved the necklace and now she she does too and can wear it easily.
"Is perfect a gift, the correct product, the box and the packaging are correct, no problem, the box is the original CASIO, and truly recommend"
"I got this early and it's super sexy. You do have to lace it up yourself which takes some time. I didn't get the tights with the bow on it. I got some fishnet ones which is kind of a bummer. So I used some different tights. My boyfriend loved the outfit which is the main reason I got this outfit (: the bra part is really right so if you have a bigger chest DO NOT GET THIS. It was so tight on me (and I have 32Bs)
Otherwise it was a cute outfit for the price."
"I'm confused why it's asking me how the shoes fit on this review...it's a ""wristlet""  though, I think if you were to put this on your wrist you'd have carpal tunnel syndrome instantly.  LOL  This thing is HUGE.  Went on a weekend trip and only brought this b/c everything in my purse fit in it.  Cell phone included.  WOW."
Good predictable fit.  That's one of the many things I love about Levi jeans.
"Definitely, it is a great two-layer jacket. An outer jacket protected me from wind while an inner one kept the warmth. If I were getting too warm, I would remove the inner jacket and wear the outer one only, and it was perfect.
Moreover, it is a very stylish jacket which did not look like a shapeless bag on me.
I get cold easily, so for myself it is a fall/cold fall jacket.

I am 5.8'' and 116 lbs. Purchased size S."
Always wanted one of these for our trips since I see so many other ladies with similar styles while vacationing. The quality is wonderful and so happens I love this print! Can't wait to use on my next vacation!
"Nice shirt. Fits about right, certainly not too big. Good price. Should hold shape and size because it's 50/50."
"I have ALOT of Betsy Johnson Jewelry but I guess I missed this one at the store and
was delighted to find this piece.  I also got the  earrings...I will have a lot of fun wearing
this jewelry as I ALWAYS get alot of comments which are always positive."
"Pink is more of a hot pink which I like better anyways, if you have the hot pink vans this belt matches them perfectly."
"This shirt is a little big, but it looks great anyway!"
I am a big fan of the arts and having socks of some of my favorite paintings just adds to my wardrobe. I love them! The colors are great and they are comfy.
Very cute. My toddler loved them for silly sock day at pre-k. thanks.
"I really like the fit.  They stay put, don't ride up and are very comfortable.  Hardly know you're wearing them."
Well made. (As well made as a plush lit up turkey carcass can be ) A sure conversation starter & laugh getter.
"2017 UPDATE
Bought 4 of these last year.  Loved them.  The one received  last week was noticeably thinner, less quality than the ones I bought last year.  Probably  won't  buy these anymore.

CON:
First off, star deducted was because it isn't fleece.  The material is more like those soft blankets so common these days.  It looks more casual and bulky looking than I would like.

PROS:
-WARMTH - That said, this keeps me warm, equivalent to a very light down jacket I have.  With a long-sleeved tshirt underneath, I fared 45-49F well.
-COMFORT- This is like wearing a blanket around.  It's soft and cuddly.
-EXTRAS - didn't expect it but there are 2 simple inner pockets.  I ditched the purse for day trips after putting the phone (charger too in some cases), keys and minimalist wallet in the inner pockets.
-GREAT as PJs too. If I new what the material is actually called, I'd get socks/slippers and sweat pants too to complete the PJ ensemble.

Came back and bought more when the site had 25 per cent off coupons for this item, just before Xmas."
These earrings are very nice looking and the 1 1/2 size is perfect. Their not too Big and not too Small. The CZ stone is very clear and it has a very pretty Sparkle to it. I would buy these again.
"I wear these all day for work, but I also put in my orthotics, so that helps a lot. The shoe itself has ZERO arch support and I can't imagine it being comfy without an insert, but they are really cute and bright and have survived pretty well so far!"
Used for wedding
my husband wore this while traveling on our honeymoon and everyone stopped to compliment him while having a laugh or two.
Beautiful bracelet.  It just barely fit my husband and he is average-sized.  This may not fit a big-boned man or woman so please keep this in mind.
The tights goes well with the elf outfit.
"I have a wide foot and often find boots are too tight on my calves. These boots fit perfectly. I got them in a wide width and they are so comfortable. Also, they zip easily over my calves. I also love the suede and buckle trim. This is my second pair of Clarks boots in wide width and I am totally happy with the quality and fit of both pairs."
I love Reeboks! These have to be the most comfortable pair of sneakers I've bought. It's been my experience with this brand that they run a little bit smaller and narrower. I usually wear a 7 so I ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfect. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.
One of my favorite pieces of jewelry.
I love these flip flops! They are super cushy and they fit great. I am always happy with the reef brand and this flip flop is another great purchase. Definitely worth the money.
"I've used this one a few times now and it's really good. It's small, which is good because I'm short and thin, so it doesn't look too big or too uncomfortable on me."
Great looking shoes. Got them for snow weather for my Colorado trip. Very warm and comfortable paired with some decent trail socks.
"Excellent product very comfortable , good quality . recommend this product."
The fit was perfect. I'm a 38 waist and shirt fit well enough to wear under another shirt for UPF protection and looked good to wear by itself.
Grandaughter loved them!
"I love Skechers Go Runs, best running shoe I've ever owned and I've owned close to 2 dozen pairs now. This was my first time trying the ""Sonic"" and while it is basically the same as the Go Run I did notice that it is ever so slightly more narrow in the toe box. Just enough to cause the sides of both of my big toes to develop small blisters, something that has never happened for me with another Go Run shoe. It wasn't terribly bothersome though and they quickly broke in and my toes toughened up in those spots, so it wouldn't stop me from purchasing another pair, just something to be aware of if you need a wider toe box."
"it fit well, super sexy and the material feels great for the price i paid im happy . THANKS Guraio"
Soft and comfy. She loves them.  They look great on her or in a pile on the floor.
I love the way it fits and looks. It's very much like my old military web belts. The only problem is that after one season the paint on the buckle was really scared. I have repainted it with what I hope is a more durable paint. I like the belt so much that I will continue to repaint it when necessary. I think Nike could have found something stronger and more durable.
I wore these to work for almost a year before they wore out and thats bc I stand all day! I LOVED these they were sturdy and super cute! Fit perfectly!
We love these sunglasses! Our baby boy has used these from about 2 months old and now at six months still great. Most of the time our little one leaves the shades on and very obviously finds comfort with them on when out in the sun.
"I read all the reviews and was concerned about the memory foam being uncomfortable because it doesn't go all the way to the sides, and we are on a tight budget and I don't usually buy this expensive of shoes, but I love purple and really needed a comfy pair of shoes- I work in a hospital and am always on the go.

When I first got them the memory foam felt really firm to the touch and the ""trampolines"" on bottom were just really hard bubbles of plastic/rubber. I wore them to work one day and my feet were in heaven! They weren't really springy, just absorbed the shock of walking, and the memory foam was heavenly on my soles. I only wish there would have been a little more arch support, but I have high arches.

My only real complaint is that on my first day wearing them I wore them to work outside in the rain. They didn't feel very grippy and I almost slipped on a wet wooden deck. I plan to keep them at work though and only wear inside so that won't be a problem for me but definitely something to think about. I couldn't imagine wearing them on snow and ice."
"What a great price, and the ring looks even nicer in person.  The large center stone is not yellowish like the picture, but more pink actually."
Fit great but because I gained weight I cant zip them up past my knees anymore and at the time they did fit I was 200 lbs. so just being honest Unless u have slim legs its def. worth trying and I'm a size 7 1/2 in shoes. I bought in size 8
Prefer the Amanda line of jeans. This style is really just barely at the size specified. A 14 is so tight that it's hard to breathe. A 16 requires tucking in and losing one's breath. Really tight fits. Might want to go one size larger if you want to breath and/or sit! But the G. Vanderbilt Amanda jean is still my one and only favorite.
Very happy with my boots!  They are comfortable and sturdy and wide enough for thick socks.
Exactly what I was looking for 
"Got what I paid for, retains color over time well and very durable with also being very comfortable."
"My boys love Avengers so I bought one of these for shirts for both.  I love the material and the fit.  The only thing I didn't like was the collar on the shirt.  It's pretty wide and slightly odd looking.  Of course, the boys couldn't care less but it still irks me every time they wear them.  Everything else about the shirt is great.  The collar is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5."
I love the feel and durability of this wallet. It is made with really nice leather.
"I purchased this wonderful, flowy, tunic dress in the green in XL, and I adore it! I'm 5'8"", 180, and the fit is pretty spot on! It's very form fitting through the back, chest, shoulders, and arms, and then it flares out substantially below the chest. I almost wish I had tried the large because it's awfully big on me in the waist area, but I'm very broad-shouldered, so I didn't want to take the chance that the large would be too tight through the top.

The dress is your standard tunic polyester/spandex blend, so it stretches considerably, and then it's met on the ends with about eight inches or so of chiffon. It's a bastard to iron! The color is gorgeous, though! It's accurate with the photo - a rich, jewel-toned green. It is long enough that one could wear it as a dress, alone, with some Spanx for safety underneath, but I plan to wear mine with leggings and boots. I tried it with a belt, and that looks cute, as well. The only problem I have with this dress goes back to all of the fabric, which is also what gives it its charm: I will absolutely have to wear some type of body shaper under this thing to avoid looking pregnant! If you are preggers, this is a dream maternity tunic! I so wish I could be pregnant again just for the clothes, lol (well, not just for the clothes). Alas, that train left the station with my last baby. But I digress. Shipping was actually very quick. This may be the fastest I've gotten anything from China, so props to this seller!

Darling, darling, darling tunic dress! And bonus...You can dress up as Stevie Nicks for Halloween!"
"These are the best pajamas I've ever gotten for my daughter.  They're cotton, which I love.  And they're soft and adorable.  She never wants to take them off."
Nice. Thought I picked both large. But seems like I chose the wrong size for one of the two I bought.
sparkly.  look good with my strawberry blonde hair
I WOULD RECOMMEND THESE SKECHERS TO ANYONE WHO WOULD BE LOOKING FOR COMFORT. THEY ARE FANTASTIC. I HAVE TWO PAIR AND WILL BE ORDERING ANOTHER IN THE NEAR FUTURE. BELLA
fit great but lost them.  just ordered another pair
"The color are just as you see it.  These socks are warm and they stay up, finally.  I plan on buying more of the same brand in different colors. I hope they all stay this well.  I am satisfied.  Great Product."
"Product was as described, it is very comfortable, was delivered when promised.  I would recommend not only this product but this seller as well!"
It's stunning. I removed like 7 links to make it more like a choker. I love it. Thank you China !! It arrived earlier. Nice....
"I haven't had a chance to wear them yet, but I tried them on and they fit great. I seen some reviews after I purchased them about them being to small to go a size up if you are 1/2 size so I was nervous about it, but I'm glad I didn't. I sometimes wear size 8 - 81/2 and I got 8 and they fit great! I don't know anything other than that."
"These run wide on my child, and she does not really have a skinny foot."
Good shoes with great price.
"Super fun buttons, bright and totally rad"
Fit as expected very warm and comfortable
"These are so cute. I get compliments every time I wear them. I would say that these are definitely a fashion sneaker. They feel a bit stiff, and are not super supportive. They are perfect for casual comfort, but I wouldn't recommend them for exercise or anything."
My almost 4 year old enjoys it! Fits like a glove.
My son loves it. It is exactly what he wanted. Came in a nice box for gift giving as well.
My son loves all these pjs.  I ordered a size up as suggested and they fit perfectly due to that.  They are very nice looking pjs and my son loves them.
"Great so far!

It is big enough to fit my Galaxy Note 5, as well as every single card I own. There are 8 card slots, a couple of them were really hard to fit anything in at first but I forced them in. It has a zipper area for change. It has 4 slots big enough to fit cash. The slot for the ID holder is nice because the ID does not get stuck to the plastic.

It still has that ""new"" odor to it but it's not horrible. Definitely worth the buy.

I put scissors and a pen in it for a scale comparison in my photo."
I use these for sleeping.  They work well.
good disign!
Great i love them
"Very nice,well made, cards fit just right."
"My favorite sleep cap/around house cap. Washes well, very soft, not too heavy."
"A great travel organizer! Used it in an overseas trip and was able to hold all 4 of the passports plus cards, plane tickets, etc. Love that it loops around your wrist and now use it as a wallet when out with kids."
"This is the 5th or 6th pair I have owned. Love them.  For me, they fit perfect right out of the box.  No worries about stretch in period, or wearing for only a few hours because they are new or stiff.  While they are a more expensive, my previous pairs have lasted a long time.  This is still a new pair for me, worn 6 times. Because of my fallen arches, and long, narrow feet, I don't have luck wearing cheaper shoes.  Glad Softwalk makes shoes that fit my foot well.  Will continue to purchase.  Thanks to Amazon... they have the best price."
"Great jeans....also bought 513, which I liked more."
"This trench/raincoat has the advantage of a hood, which I used the first day I wore it.  I went into lunch in a restaurant with a friend and when we came out it was raining.  I just flipped up the hood and I was good to go.  I bought a size small instead of my usual medium, because I had purchased another Via Spiga raincoat in medium and found it too big.  This is a different style, so I probably could have used a medium, but without anything bulky under it, I think this will be fine for warm weather use.  The fabric is lightweight and comfortable; the belt fits well and the arm length is good."
"my grandson loves this batman watch. it tells time and lights up, does everything it says"
Have purchased several of these at different times with consistent quality. Machine washed several times and maintains color and structure.
"I have been a professional chef for many years, now into a new profession...still wearing these beautiful and resilient clogs, I highly recommend them!"
lines thru them
Very soft and nice~ I like it very much~
Good house shoes & light use outside.
Great for foot cramps
I love these sandals. They are super cute and go with lots of outfit choices. If they seem tight don't freak out they will loosen up as you break them in. I love them and wear them all the time.
Just the right size.  Thanks.
"I wear a 8. Having to return for a 8.5. SO  worth the money. Fabulous color. Have order the lighter one. Waiting to see the difference. Might be  tempted into both, but since it`s late September, definitely keeping the natural 8,5. when it arrivesKeep the other one for Spring.."
"As soon as I put these shoes on, I felt a sense of relief on how comfortable and light they were, and I kept them on the rest of the night.  I walk my dogs usually a few miles a day, and I love that I can just slip these on and off we go.  They aren't especially water proof and are fabric-based, so beware of puddles, but otherwise, they're terrific, and I've raved to all my friends about them! I hope to get more pairs in other colors!"
This tie is beautiful and well made. It looks much more expensive than the sale price. Heirloom quality. . . my nephews will be able to use it after my son.
Very nice.  We've traveled with them several times.  They are holding up well.
"I have mild diabetes swelling in my right foot which makes wearing shoes and boots uncomfortable. I purchased some high-quality Tony Lama boots and even though the retailer stretched the right boot, it was not enough. Instead of taking them back, I purchased this and was able to stretch them another half size so that putting on the boot and wearing it throughout the day is much more comfortable. I also partially leather stretcher spray it seemed to help. I left the stretcher in several days now I am a happy boot walker"
"These Shoes are Awesome!!!  ,  my Daughter got these last year at a local shoe  store ( paid more $) and  had so many Complements and very Rich looking . So of course i had to get my self a pair , Only thing I have to say about these  Sandals , Is  (  No matter what size you are , Just Get the next size up .) Im a size 9 .. and took a chance on getting a size 10 ( Best Choice Ever)  and watch them on Amazon ,  they seem to run out quickly in  the size you want and color  Thankyou ( will Buy these again ) :o)"
"I used this first on my trip to the Maldives and then to Thailand afterward. It's incredibly light and sturdy. It also has room for two weeks of clothing, tons of toiletries and a few souvenirs. Saved me money on checked luggage. My only concern is that the material probably won't last and so I give it fewer stars. Right now it's holding up well."
"I will always buy Lucky Jeans.  They're not the same as they were 13 years ago, but they fit better than Levi's."
"This is my third pair of Paloma shoes.  I wear them for work (nurse) because I do a lot of walking and my feet don't hurt after 8 hours.  Love the fun colors and get so many complements on my shoes.  The only thing with this pair, is that they make my socks slide forward, which is something my other 2 pairs of Palomas didn't do.  Wear them anyway, did not do that if I wore nylons, however."
I got these to replace an old pair of really sweet black flats (lost one of the pair). These are fun yet being black they can be dressy too.
"The man and I were sitting down for an evening of SOA and he said he loved the hat.  So I of course being the totally awesome chick I am started looking for it and reading all the reviews.  This hat came and it was perfect.  The fit was great, the look is great.  Looks just like the hat from the show and the man couldn't be happier."
I ordered a size too big and it was still small. I gave it away. Good quality
Lost my glasses while jet skiing....they work thank god!
"Bought these for my six year old daughter, and she loves them. They fit well, but I agree with some of the other reviews that you may need to add an extra hole or two to the strap. The last hole still gives my daughter enough room that her heel comes up out of the shoe, but she doesn't seem to mind too much. She's excited to wear them for our pictures coming up, and for our upcoming trip."
My husband stands on his feet 11 hours a day and loves these shoes. This is the second pair we have purchased. They break down quickly but that's because the amount of abuse he puts them through. Great shoe for work !
"Was looking for some light weight sandals that will look smart too so I can wear them anywhere. Decided to try the Clarks Lexi since I wear a lot of Clarks shoes and I'm certain of the size (I wear 8). They arrived in time, tried them on and the fit is perfect, they are very light weight, was expecting a little more cushion than provided but they are fine. Light weight and smart looking. The strap is also easy to tie unlike some sandals I have had and had to struggle with the strap because it was too short and also so tight that by the end of the day my ankles would be hurting! Not so with these Lexi Sumac Wedge Sandals! The strap has plenty of length and easy on your ankles too! I do recommend them for easy and light weight wear."
They look exactly like the picture and they are surprisingly light and do not weigh my feet down I love them
"I've had mediocre experience with Doc Marten's casual shoes.  I've previously bought others from DSW and direct from DrMartens USA web store, but the quality of their shoes has never been up to that of the standard issue boot (which carries the guarantee that the shoes do not).  Save the first pair of Doc leather shoes I had, EVERY other one has had some flaw emerge after a few months of regular use.  Seams and stitching wear out and start splitting.  Despite that I opted to try these, and so far, so good.  They're all leather outside, and somewhat stiff and uncomfortable at first.  I'd plan to wear them a few hours a day casually on the weekend before you take them for an all-day spin.  After a few days of (sucking it up at work) breaking them in, they're significantly better.  If you can get through a few days, they're not bad.  One thing to note: they don't have a lot of extra vertical clearance inside, as in for additional insoles/padding.  Many of my shoes bear additional gel inserts for comfort, but they would not fit comfortably in these, as they put too much pressure on the tops of my feet when laced securely, but once broken in, I've not been bothered with the standard beds.  I don't feel much arch support, but I have slightly flat feet, so less of an issue."
Husband loves these! Comfortable. Stay in place on his foot. Fast shipping.
My Girlfriend look AMAZING on this dress!! good quality nice shape and fabric we just LOVE it!!!
A nice low profile shoe and they fit true to size. They are pretty comfortable but do not have a lot of support.
"Look, it's a cheap shirt. You're not going to get a really nice fit or finish. But for the price it works well and I really like the tie and matching kerchief. Had a lot of compliments on the tie."
"I like the Carhartt quality and the length, but they fit a little tight on the hips. Going a couple numbers up to the next size would be too large, so I gotta live with the tight fight (hope Carhartt improves this somewhen)."
I LOVE my necklace. It is of very good quality and very cute and blingy!! I love how well the cross lays on my chest
The shirt was some what large for a XL - but seems to be made nice and doesn't look like the logo will be cracking. Easy Halloween costume get up with a white button down shirt. Would buy again if I had too.
"Very impressed, great price. Will buy them again."
"There are a couple of earrings I don't really wear out of this set, but it was completely worth the money.  They are so cute and look so cool.  I've gotten quite a few compliments about these earrings."
I like to recommend
WELL MADE FOR THE  PRICE
Fits good and good price for the quality
"Bought for an ugly sweater day at work and it was an epic fail because everybody thought it was adorable. Even Santa asked to take a picture with me!  Fit well, nicely made, and definitely not ugly."
Too long for my foot. I have lots of their other sandals with straps that fit fine.
"These are great bandannas. Good quality; hold up in repeated washings, and comfortable on my nose. Great size; minimal shrinkage."
I love Docs - every color and style imaginable.  They are the highest quality shoe/boot made in my opinion.  They never wear out (I have a pair I've been wearing since 1999) and are amazingly comfortable.  Definitely worth the price.  Love them!
"Awesome lock, did the job when I went to Vegas"
"Can you say cozy? I'm so glad I scored these at such an awesome price of 40 bucks. After last winter in Providence, I needed better boots. My expensive Keens did not keep my feet warm. (Granted they're a couple years old.) These are super comfy and warm. They don't have fabulous arch support like my Keens, just OK like a thick soled slipper. However, I can see myself being comfortable in these all day. I haven't tested them in cold or wet weather yet, but I wore them around the house and they warmed up my feet and legs quickly. I like the height and how they look with skinny pants/jeans/leggings. A little moon bootish without the clunky feel. They pull on easy and I think the draw string toggle at the top will come in handy when I take my boys sledding this year to keep the snow out.

Why 4 Stars Instead of 5:
I'm glad I paid attention to the reviews and ordered a size up. I'm a size 8 every day (except in athletic shoes 8.5), but with these I ordered a 9. They're not the least bit too big. Obviously, the sizing is off, but if you heed the warnings to size up, you'll be fine. I also find the toe box a little narrow, unlike my Keens.

WAY less expensive than my Keen boots and I expect more functional in winter."
very stylish and comfortable to wear. Bought a few Akademiks products on sale on Amazon all are well done. This shirt fit well.
"I love these boots. I ordered a size smaller, and the fit is beautiful."
"Finally I found a slip that was just right for me, after searching every department store they just don't carry them anymore.  Thank you will buy again."
"I love this hand gel; it has a nice texture to it, and has an awesome scent that will stay on your hands for hours after its application. Oh, and it does a great job of keeping one's hands virtually germ-free. You can't go wrong with this refreshing and effective hand sanitizer/gel. I recommend it."
"I wear them all day long with not problems, very comfortable, they look nice, so far not problems at all."
I ordered 2 pair from lapg got to me quickly. Seem to be well made they come highly recommended. I like both pair. I am going to order the blue pair. I washed 1 pair no problems.they will be a little hot for the summer. I'm happy.
"I have at least 10 Baggallini bags. This is my favorite. I hate purses and was using a smaller one that I loved, but using my new eyeglasses + sunglasses wasn't working along with my large phone.  I had to go up a size and this is perfect because of the multiple storage areas.  Just prior to this purchase I bought another Baggallini that I thought would work but it seemed deeper and with less separate pockets so I was having to dig deep to find small items like lipstick in the main compartment. This has so many storage areas you can split things up with easy access. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one I received seems to have a faulty magnet closure in the middle compartment.  I bought a very similar purse at TJ Maxx (exactly the same but gray and without the small front flapped area & the back magnetic closure area) & the middle magnets closed perfectly unless I opened them.  So I'm not sure if this was made wrong or because of the addition of those 2 small front & back storage areas causing more pulling (even without anything in those pockets). They do ""close"" but they open much more easily than the other similar purse I have.  I ordered this because TJ Maxx didn't have this in black.  I was afraid of the ""cheetah"" print but I love it - very subtle but nicer than just plain black."
"So far, I like this suit.  I don't love it.  There are a few bizarre things about the fit that I don't quite understand.  Other reviewers said that this fits small on top and large on the bottom.  That's perfect for my body type so I thought this would work.  I'm 5'6, 110lb, 34A.  I ordered a size small.  That was definitely the right choice...a medium would have been way too big.  But it still doesn't exactly fit right.

The top is really large around.  For a size small, a 34 is pretty standard.  This does have an adjustable back, but I have it adjusted to the smallest setting.  As you can see from the picture there are still a few extra inches of fabric, making this waaaaaay too loose to wear.  It's going to be an easy fix with a needle and thread, but you shouldn't need to do that with a new suit.  I'd say this is more like a 38.

The top is also....short for lack of a better word.  It rides up.  I'm not tall and not big, but the top keeps creeping up toward my neck.  Hopefully once I get the strap tighter this won't happen as much.

The bottom fits pretty well.  It's definitely short.  I'm a mom, and this is more of a ""wear on a weekend vacation with your husband"" swimsuit than a ""wear to the pool with the kids"" swimsuit.

This is a really cute suit if you're willing to work for it a little bit.  I can't imagine many people whom this would fit straight out of the box.  That being said, the suit appears to be good quality and it's really cute.  The blue color is vibrant just as it is in the pictures."
Cute but they don't fit right.
For $12 these shorts are a great value. I've owned these shorts for over a year and run almost 5 days a week with them. They're durable and comfortable. I definitely recommend these shorts for runners.
"Great little card case, and so feminine."
Love the fabric and its very comfortable
"It is hard to say why I love this purse so much but I do. Just the shape, the size, the color. It all works so well. It cheers me to see it hanging on the chair waiting for me to go out.  This purse has room in it, despite it's relatively small size.  I can fit 2 water bottles inside the big compartment as well as fitting in a large wallet on one of the side compartments.  I did buy the Hedgren wallet & not sure I'm as happy with that as the purse but even that large item fits in this purse. I love that this purse has several compartments, all being held by a sturdy zipper with a very substantial pull tab. The tab is thick & durable, this is no cheaply  constructed item.  The strap can be adjusted but I've had no reason to do so as it fits so nicely as is.  I love this purse more than any other I've ever had.  The one thing it does not have is a holder for a phone but that is a small thing compared to all the pluses."
Its so beautiful and you can't beat the price I just wish the earrings matched a little bit better.
Love to color love the fit
"Arrived a bit earlier than estimated.  Plain ziploc bag, and a pic or bit of instruction/direction on how to wear would have been nice. All in all, pleased with product!"
"Very soft. Love these, and the fit is good. (I typically wear a 4-6 in pants.)"
Perfect for my outfit!!!  Fast shipping too!!!
"This is a nice time piece! It is comfortable and seems to be holding time fine! I started out by giving it a 3 star rating but feel ,because it holds time well, I up'd the rating. I do feel that the quality of the band could be better however. FOR THE MONEY, it is a nice timepiece with that classic look! So if you want that Daytona-like appearance without the 5 figure price tag,than this is a very nice compromise! I think Invicta is a nice company. I choose this after my son purchased the Sub-like watch over a year ago and he likes it very much! So I recommend this based on it's bang-for-the buck!!!"
"Very nice pants. Fit well, comfortable, good weight of denim."
"love it, love it.  So damn please with this item.  Plenty of room and love the color and good quality wallet."
"These little boots are very cool. They are comfortable with no break-in period. The style is very ""now"". I would definitely recommend these to my friends."
Awesome.  Great buy. Perfect size
This is a good sturdy bra. it is more comfortable than I expected. The reason for only 4 stars is because the padding bunches up everytime I wash it and I have to smooth it back into shape.
Finally won't have blisters and hurt toes and heels.  Just what I've been looking for.  Fit as expected. Wear a 9 shoe. Bought a size 2.
Adorable design & comfy
"Now here is an excellent way to keep your jewelry in place. Elegant design makes it easy put in your watches, earrings, wallet, etc.
 Great purchase and super cool to look at... not to mentioned that it fits in the bedroom drawer perfectly."
"So far I'm going to start out with a 5 star! Honestly I just got the boots a few minutes ago. First impressions are very high!

Box from Thorogood has an American flag on it. I know this has no relevance to the boots fit/construction, but I smiled like a small child opening a package on Xmas. God bless America!

I will say that I have a long, flat, narrow foot. For those men out there who share my pain of trying to find B width boots, you know our options are very limited. I've been through 8 pairs of red wings, and countless other brands. My favorite pair of red wings are not made anymore, so again I hit the internet to find something I won't die in after working 12+ hours a day.

I wear a 12 B in red wings, and ordered the same in these Thorogoods. My first impression was they might be a little long, but definitely couldn't go down 1/2 a size. So I'd say they are fairly true to size. These are the first pair I've ordered that aren't steel toe, so I can't compare with my other boots since I can't check to see where my toe truly sits in my steel toes.

As far as the narrow width, I'd say it's spot on. If you have narrow feet you know that all boots look a little funky when laced tightly since the gap between the two halves is generally pretty close together. Unfortunately, that has not changed in these boots. Honestly I don't care what they look like, so long as they fit. Little bit snug around the pinky toe area and the widest part of my foot, but that is fine in new boots. They will stretch, and I'd rather they be a little snug, than too loose and blistery.

The soles and construction/stitching all seems to be very similar to what you'd expect from any other real mans work boot. My ariats, red wings, and now these, are all pretty similar. The color is ok I guess. Honestly I wish they made a black boot with a dark sole since I'm a mechanic. The red is going to be dark red and the white sole is going to be black over the next week anyway, so I guess I shouldn't complain.

I will continue to wear these and update this review down the road a bit when I've had a real chance to give them hell at the shop. So far I'd say if you're on the fence about laying down a days worth of pay on some red wings, you might want to order these and take the old lady out for some Big Macs instead. If you have narrow feet like me, these are a very highly recommended boot, and now I'm seeing why.

Update: After wearing these every other day (I alternate boots), these have broken in very well. Soles are of course no longer white, and the orange of the leather has darkened with daily exposure to oil. Theyve molded to my feet pretty well. The one thing I have noticed is that my right boot, on the outer edge of my foot just before the pinky toe, does rub where the edges of all the stitching meets. Isnt so bad it causes a blister, but when you wear them all day, it definitely turns my skin red and a bit sore. Not sure what the fix would be, but they're well broken in, so its either just a defect in this boot, or my right foot is weird. Never experienced this with any other boot brands, so Im guessing its the boot itself.

The soles are extremely comfortable and these boots are nice and light. I work easy 12 hrs a day, and these are still my favorites. Minus the one spot that rubs, I get home and my feet aren't tired. Concrete can do a number on you after a long day, but these boots sure help with that."
"Really was what I'm expected , size , color, what I saw I got"
"Review of: ""Standard Unbreakable Umbrella U-115 Walking Stick W/Crooked Handle Self-Defense.""

Bottom line reviewer opinion:  Excellent umbrella which truly has amazing strength and durability that can be applied to self-defense against attackers and the elements.

There are already many thoughtful reviews in both written and video format so I won't digress into another one.  I simply wanted to let any prospective buyers know that this product is exactly what it claims to be.  As a martial arts practitioner I decided to work this product a little bit myself.  I practiced defense against standing striking bags and placed enough weight on it to break a traditional umbrella.  The results revealed no damage to the structure or material of the umbrella.  That is good enough for me.  The umbrella is sturdy with a strong end cap to use as a cane and of course opens to a very strong umbrella.  The rainstorms  under which I have employed it were also accompanied by strong gusts of wind.  The umbrella never wavered or collapsed.  Impressive indeed.  Five stars."
"We've always been a fan of New Balance shoes for ourselves and our boys. Unfortunately the last pair we got for our oldest was awful. The back immediately broke down, which made it almost impossible to wiggle his foot in. That combined with just learning to tie his shoes on his own led to a lot of frustration. Luckily THESE shoes seem to be on par with what we would expect from New Balance- nice and sturdy. And my son (1st grade) LOVES the design- he wanted to sleep in them tonight!"
These are so comfortable and beautiful!
"Love the shoes, everything I had hoped for."
"I have a dress that I used when my daughter got married. Beautiful purple long dress that I decided to shorten to use for a relative's wedding at the end of this month. While browsing shoes and came across these and they are a PERFECT match and that's not an exaggeration. It has the same color, same jewels. I had hesitated purchasing them at first. I'm short and like to wear wedges but am disabled with a bad back so flats are better. Every time I got on I was concerned that the color might be just too good to be true until I noticed the price drop and couldn't resist ordering them. I'm so glad I got them. If I would've waited just a little longer I could have paid less but the price was still right. Before disability, I had very narrow, skinny feet but now my feet are wider and swell up. So they fit just a tad tight but the since the day I got them, I've been working on them to get a little wider so I know that will not be a problem. I also know I will probably use them with other purple outfits since regardless of the tightness, the step is still comfortable! I love Yellow Box shoes also. Have purchased sandals and love them. Now purchased a different kind of shoe and still love them. Absolutely, worth getting!"
The material of this dress of thick and nice elegant. Good price!!
"OMG, I am so happy with this purchase. For this price the quality is really good, it fits like a glove and supports in all the right places. The bra doesn't make my look bulgy, and panties are very tight yet provide good form and hug my curves."
I returned this shoe--only because I purchased a similar shoe. The zipper was difficult to use.
This actually looks nicer in person than from the photo.  I love my bag - lots of compartments for organization.
It is wonderful and very well made!!!!
Great color; Nice watch.
"Bought this watch for my brother, it's beautiful. It looks better than the picture!"
It will be used as a nursing top. So I am happy with what I got.
"What's to say.  As advertised, fast delivery.  Good people. I use this as a ""marker"" when my wife and I go on vacation.  Good to keep me in sight.  Plus, it is warm.  Whatta hat!!"
This dress is beautiful.  It looks really nice and fits as expected.  The lace detail is very pretty.
"Awesome except everyone else thought so too st burning man! Toooo many ppl with them :( not ""unique"" as expected."
Love them! Super comfy a love the style!
Well made and good fit.  Got the look without paying big bucks!
Excellent socks but sometimes I have to buy bigger shoes. It does depend on how thick the socks.
"Very well made, sturdy mask.  The details are beautiful"
"I have a hard time with jeans because I have short legs and a belly. Pants need to sit around my hips, under my belly, which means that I need a short inseam. These are the only jeans that don't squeeze my upper thighs and are short enough that I'm not walking on the back of the pants. They seem to fit like pants should fit a normal person, and they didn't need to be hemmed or modified. I'm 5'9"" and weight 230lbs for those interested."
"I was worried about this watch because the price was so low. It was to replace my moms 16 year old seiko that finally broke. We shopped all the dept stores and it was on sale for 215$ everywhere. I found this one on Amazon for 136. When we got it, it came in the manufactures box with all the books and warranty, the manufacturers tag said 285$. Set it in the sun for an hour, set the time and it was good to go. It is a little heavier then her old seiko which looks exactly like this one, but the quality was still there. An excellent buy!"
Really like this bikini.  Fits great & hasn't worn at all.  Great vibrant colors too.  I ordered a Large and it fit perfectly.
Fit a little tall for a crew sock. I must have fat calves so I bought these for work socks because a normal cotton crew sock is tight on my calf. These don't feel tight and don't leave indentations at the end of the day on my calf. I normally like a cotton sock to help my feet breath. These seem to make my feet a little sweatier by the end of the day. Overall a good sock and I would buy again.
"This is your typical spandex black dress that can be worn at different times.  Dress it up or down and the front faux pockets will add something new that all your other black little numbers in your closet do not have.  The front pockets are not actual pockets.  Many are complaining that it is shapeless and I believe that it depends on the actual form that it lays on.  Being big chested, the pockets add a nice shape and it does cinch in a tiny bit.  The pocket flaps are not visible from the back.

The material is great because it should not need to be ironed if hung up.  It also washes easily in cold water.  My only gripe is that it is overpriced for what you are receiving.  It is comfortable and versatile but not for this price.  If I am being honest, it would be a great buy at fifty percent of the current cost.

Recommend if you like rayon/stretchy dresses that you can accessorize for different occassions.  At my suggested lower cost then this would be a dress that I could highly recommend to be a part of every woman's wardrobe."
The leggings aren't high waisted like I like and they do run small so make sure you order a size up!
"This is the greatest little bag, but holds what I need everyday.  So light to carry and sooooo soft.  I am now looking into more of this brand, why pay more when you can get style and quality for less"
I wish they have more colors available. I got the black and now I am ordering two more for my daughter. I love it
"Best luggage tags I ever had. Good design. If I evercneed more, these will be the ones."
"Great quality.  However, as a result of all the reviews, I ordered the largest size and they fit a 7 1/2 foot perfectly."
Super comfy and great packaging.
"beautiful, granddaughter loved it"
Very comfy but run big.
"I have problems with my eyes (diabetes) that require frequent visits to my Retinologist for work or checkups (and having my eyes dilated).  For years I wore some ""medical"" over the glasses sunglasses to be able to drive home, but never used them for anything else (they were ugly and uncomfortable).  When those glasses were accidentally broken, I decided to get something else (anything else).  When these glasses came in, I was amazed at how well they fit, how comfortable they were, and how well they fit  Do yourself a favor, and try these instead of the ""traditional"" medical over the glasses sunglasses. I now have sunglasses I can wear anywhere, and any time, even if when I haven't been to the doctor."
Comfortable and as advertised
Love these shoes. Very comfortable. Perfect fit.
"The shoes run large, but the quality is great. I love them."
"Fit is good, wish the heel was just a tad bit higher."
"These definitely help keep your luggage organized.  For me, the medium is the perfect size for folded shirts and pants.  In the large they shifted around a lot unless I placed things like socks around the border.  The small is a great fit for a pair of heels (women size 10).  I plan to order more mediums and use the large as a laundry bag for future travel."
"I have been a long-time fan of the Bali Comfort Revolution bra. I ordered the S and it fits just a bit small, but the M would've been too large. They used to have them in the different sizes. I miss having it in my specific size, but I find this style so comfortable, I'll take what I can get."
"I was running out of the house to do a quick errand and all I needed was my phone, my drivers license and one credit card, yet I needed to lug my entire purse with me.  Then I saw this travel wallet and organizer.  It looked big enough for my large phone (Nexus 6), it had RFID blocking material on both sides (front & back) of the wallet, and it was lightweight.  This is what Ive been looking for  a small stylish wallet / purse that I could use for quick errands that would easily hold my phone and other items and could easily fit into my glove compartment when I went to the gym or other places that I didn't want to bring a purse into.  This is not just a wallet to take on major trips (which I plan to do since it will hold all my travel document and other needs) but a wallet to use every day. I have lots of options of where to put items  including my phone.  And, I like having options of how to wear or carry the wallet  it comes with a detachable shoulder strap as well as a carry handle. The pictures next to the product description are accurate so I won't bother describing all the features  you can see them in the pictures.  But, I will describe how happy I am to have found this wallet! Highly recommend this quality wallet! I'm attaching pictures to show the options I have to place my large Nexus 6 phone into the wallet. I received this travel wallet for a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  I hope youve found this review helpful."
fits as expected. I love it!
I LOVE this ring!  It is beautiful and catches the eye of everyone.  I would defiantly buy it again!
Great pants for an old fart like me.  They have elasticized waist which is quite comfortable.  Very well made. Look great.
"I love these soft comfortable leggings! They wash and dry perfectly. I have 3 pairs and the length is inconsistent, one is perfect, one is too long, which doesn't bother me. They are easily rolled up, worn with converse or tucked into boots. They are perfect for at home, but can also wear them out. Perfect to wear with a tunic or cardigan. I normally wear a size 10 or L and the one size fits perfect. I would not wear these to run or workout, they aren't that type of material."
"Really cool eye glass case. It looks just like my cat, and that's her ""you will feed me now"" look. haha. LOVE IT!"
"This would make a good gift. It came beautifully boxed in elegant black. The earring tree itself is a bronze/brass color. I would have given this 5 stars if it had any holes for pierced earrings. It's good for hoop and ear wire earrings and they look very pretty on this ""tree"". I think that for the price it's a great value."
Beautiful okay shirt !
"She loved it. Well crafted, fit as expected, would purchase again."
Love this. Needed a red clutch and love this !!
"Nice lounging outfit and sleepwear. Very soft! I don't wake up sweating in the middle of the night either - big plus. Cute enough to wear around the house, comfy enough to sleep well in.

 Only issue I have is they came with a small hole. Otherwise great!"
I'm happy with it!
"The only reason I did not give this product five starts is because I bought for my grandson to wear at the beach and we haven't taken our trip yet, so he hasn't seen/worn them yet.  They have a bit more arch support than I was expecting so I am thinking he can even wear these a good bit this summer - not just at the beach!"
very cute.  Love it.
It's nice.  I was hoping for peep toe not open toe. Also I wear a 6.5 and the shoe was kinda big. So you want to order a half size down probably.
Love the color and light weight of these!
"Great dress up for my 3 year old- little big, but he can grow into it.  The accessories are fun, but as others stated, the fire extinguisher didn't work long.  My son doesn't mind though and the rest of the outfit it worth the money."
Looks like the picture. Im 5'5 - 187 it hits the thigh. My 5'7 and only 120 lb niece it was really long on her. Great buy for price.
"This is a really cool sweater dress, but sized for a waif.  I ordered it one size larger than usual and it's still more like a tunic than a dress.  It is, simply put, sexy as hell.  I really like this dress and so does my wife."
"Really pretty, fit perfectly. My grand daughter loved it."
Best boot I ever owned! Very comfortable..
Standard quality Suedes.  Great colors.
"Ordered shoe specific size, got it.  What more can I ask for?"
"Very comfortable and good quality. I particularly like that the straps can be changed to a criss-cross style to accommodate tank tops and shirts that aren't quite a racerback but also won't cover bra straps in the ""traditional"" position."
I'm usually a size 8 and after reading the reviews ordered a size 9.  They fit perfectly at a size up! They are cute shoes and decent quality.  The only thing I would change would be the latch device because one has to pull rather hard to get it to fit over the buckle on the corresponding strap.  All in all it's a very attractive heel with the perfect height for cruising around on your feet.
"Love the dress, but it is a little deceiving on your site.  I expected it to be more  flowing  but it's not."
they met my expectations
"These are cute, stylish, cuddly, and soft. Love all the patterns and colors available. Received them in perfect time as well."
"My daughters favorite thing in the world to do right now is stomp in mud puddles.  When I saw these at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, I had to have them.  They are so cute.  I took a lot of really great pictures of her splashing around in them when we first got them.  I bought them so she would not destroy her shoes but once I got them they were so cute I did not want her ruining these either.  These boots will probably be one of the things I save for memories.  On another note she splashed around for about a half an hour and no water on her socks."
My daughter looks great in them & she loves the way the feel on.
Cute I love em
Perfect size... perfect fit....  distressed just perfectly.... Very nice jeans. The mid waist hits me in just right.
"very nice, somwath large"
"I've used this a half a dozen times already, kept it in the shoe 2-3 days at a time, used the plastic ""buttons"" that came with it.  I think it's quite useful to have and it seems solidly made.  I'm glad I made this choice for a wooden/metal one instead of a plastic one."
My husband's dress shoes finally wore out after years of once per week use.  He finds these shoes super comfortable & they look smart too!
My daughter liked the fit and comfort. No complaints
Perfect combo of cute and comfortable
"Love this little suitcase! Plenty of compartments; nice size; well constructed; lightweight, easy to wheel.
This might be the perfect weekend bag."
"The shoes were delivered on time and looked just like the picture. I ordered in the tan/light brown color. The shoes are very pretty and I like the style very much. The size fit. However, it was too loose for my feet. My feet slide around too much. I got a M (not W - wide). I tried them on in the evening too, so unfortunately I will have to return them (only reason)."
Work great.  Nice fit.
My grandaughter wears these out in the snow over her clothes and they stay dry
Happy with product.  Fits as expected.
These fit perfectly and are of a great quality.
Second pair of these. Had them shipped to my daughter in Australia. She wears them every time she walks to the shops.
"I liked these boots a lot, you just have to wear them with normal socks."
"This dress is actually one of my favorite. It is very flatering on me. And for the price,I was surprised for the quality. A great deal."
Love the greys. The work for me. After twenty washes time for new ones.
Warm and comfortable good for jogging
Somewhat smaller than expected but cute.
"This is hands down the best skirt I've ever purchased. It's ridiculously comfortable & very versatile. You can dress up or down with it.
The fabric is so incredibly soft, you could probably even sleep in it as well! It's figure flattering and worth every cent & my only regret is not buying it sooner."
"Very comfy shirt, & fits well."
The first one was too small according to the measurements for our son who is tall with a thin build. We had to go up a size which is long enough but gives him a lot of extra room. That was not necessarily a bad thing though. He simply wears it over his street clothes and has had the opportunity to wear this often. Good job.
I added my own arch supports and then everything was great - a very good buy for the price!!
Love these boots. They are very comfortable!
"Wonderful buy! Definitely nickel-free, I have been able to wear continuously without discomfort.  it is beautiful and the closing is very secure. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
I would go up a size next time or try harder to find a wider more relaxed fit.
Online shopping has been good so she does not have the same shoes as all the other girls.  Good quality shoes.
I have a pair of arizona's  and I ordered the same size (41) for the tobacco leather Boston clogs.  Fits like a glove! from some of the reviews I was skeptical but these aren't stiff at all and the leather is soft.  I love slipping my feet in them when I go to work.  Highly recommend these if your on your feet all day
"Very pleased with the fit, and the style.  I've gotten compliments when I've worn the sandals."
I'm a bartender and these are perfect for working in the summer!
"Great product!  I wanted a nursing cami, but couldn't find one in my size (32 J).  This gave me the coverage I desired, while letting me wear my own bra.  It does slip down in the back sometimes, but it isn't a big deal for me."
Love this bracelet.  Looks great on and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  Love the idea of changeable designs.
Excellent quality.  Color makes it easy to find in a large blue lined purse.
"very good product, my family love it. arrived on time, we recommend this product and encourage our friends to do it."
"Someone finally got it right! I love love this bra. I normally wear 38E bra. I ordered a 38E, and it fits perfectly. I have very good support. I ordered 2 more today."
"My housemate and I both got each other these pajamas as a Christmas present. We both love them, though more elastic in the ankle would have helped with the fact that the inseam is made long enough to fit very tall people. But they're incredibly comfortable. We love to put on our footed pajamas and retire to the living room on tv night."
I love this shoe. I'm a solid size 6 in women's and it fit perfectly. Very comfortable.
Comfortable great looking strap.
Bought these for my step-daughter who loves giraffes. She loves them.
"I run about 25 miles a week.  This is by far the best shoe I have ever had.  My leg and knee pain is down to zero.  I just ordered another of the same pair for when these reach the end of their life.  They do run a tad small, as some other reviewers stated.  i went up a half size, and they're perfect."
"This is a nice purchase, I ordered a set in green. Thick, good fabric."
"I like keen shoes. I have had several pairs. I am sometimes a 8 sometimes and 8.5. I figured that since I'd be wearing these shoes with thick socks (in the winter and all), I'd go for the 8.5. I also have wide and the tops of my feet are high(?), so I often have trouble finding shoes that don't hurt the top of my feet. These not only fit the bill, but I feel like there is really nothing around my toes. They're really comfortable.

The green is a REALLY bright green, almost fluorescent (I bought these because of the green, but in person it's a little bright)."
"Just as advertised. Satisfied, and no problem."
My daughter adores these earrings!
"These are great winter boots, the best arch support ever and very comfortable plus they're cute on"
"Pretty comfortable. I ordered a 4E, but could have got by with a 2E width.  I""m normally a 10 and a half and these shoes are an 11, so I would say that these shoes are a little smaller (half size) than a Nike or Adidas.
Use these on the treadmill and the elliptical and my feet are fine with the support they have."
got it for my sister she loves it!! and the price is not bad either the automatic open and close is convenient for her when carrying the baby.
"I might order some more, they very comfortable."
I love the ring so pretty and such a good quality!
Very comfortable summer shoe.  Love how the wind cuts through them to air my feet.  Should have bought more during the sale.
Just what I wanted in light weight cape. Ordered it in 2 colors. Highly recommend for comfort and cool.
Really Nice ring very happy priced right and fit right to size. Big ring too.
"The Bali underwear fit perfectly, the price was terrific and it came very quickly. I'm very happy with this purchase. For info I'm 5'4"" and 240lbs. Got the size 10/11, perfect fit and the most comfortable underwear I have ever owned."
The only flaw in this watch is it isn't waterproof.
Taller than 29
My warm weather go to tee shirts.
Gorgeous !!  wonderful fit & very versatile . I wear it to work & casual as well . The colors are more lovely in person from that shown online. This one is a must have.
Love them and they Are so comfortable :)
"I purchased these for my son to wear to D.C. on a class trip. We live in FL so snow boots are not something we invest a lot of money in.  We ordered a half size larger so his boot socks would fit. He said they were very comfortable and he wore them all day for four days walking around D.C. They went right after the 2016 snow storm so there was plenty of wet, cold, and snow to trek through. No leaks and all day warmth.  No complaints from a 14 year old...that's something special!"
I LOVE this boot and this brand.
Less baggy-butt with these shorts compared to Levi's.  Good length and comfortable.  Would recommend for purchase - may come back for another pair.
This was a gift wrapped birthday gift for special friend. It turned out to be more useful for her than i had considered. She now has to use a walker to get around until knee distress can be repaired. Well this cross body bag can be in place with all the neccessery items and hands free for the walker. And the bag is good looking and soo handy. Great go with everything color too. All weather finish. And the gift wrap option is more than you would ever guess. I received something before too and what a nice wrap. This one was well received by my old friend.
"I recently. Purchased a couple of these very comfy and stylish tunic tops.
Although I  Like them very much, my favorite one is the XL St 15 the fit is perfect, but I really enjoy the print and color. I will be wearing them with a pair of burgundy leggings and the cutest pair of tan booties I own!
Compliments of Amazon.  I would normally wear an xlg.
I am looking forward to ordering 3 more of these tops."
runs somewhat small. but durable!
My podiatrist recommended these for their support since I suffer from plantar fasciitis. They are super comfortable and lightweight.
"Beautiful and elegant. Very classy. We went on a babymoon and i wanted to show off my baby bump but still be covered on the bottom. Look so beautiful in the ocean breeze.will order more. Ordered the red hibiscus with white, did a beach photoshoot with a red bikini and red hibiscus flower clip in my hair. My husband thought it looked beautiful too!"
My gf loves these shoes!!!
I absolutely LOVE them!  They're stylish and comfortable; can't go wrong with that!
"Worth Every Penny, Looks and wears like a jewel!!!. I would buy at lease two of these!!. Thanks Amazon and Fashion Plaza."
"True to size, good support  for the type of exercises that I do ( I lift weights and bike), lots of cute colors.  I would happily buy this bra again next time I'm shopping  for a sports bra."
I had the brown for a couple years. Comfortable but wearing and a little scuffed. Got the black at a good price and they're doing great. Am wearing them now w/o socks to work. Summer is about here and I'll live in these.
Great quality how ever it was small enough to fit my daughter which is about 2 sizes smaller than my son with it was Intended for
"These fit perfectly, even after being washed and dried in the dryer (on low).  The denim is a nice thickness, not thin, but has the perfect amount of spandex to provide give without stretching out of shape.  No binding anywhere!  Love them so much, I bought another 2 pairs!"
I absolutely love this dress great buy
"I find this is a great way to cover up when cooking. The shirt is comfortable and protects the clothes I wear underneath. It also doesn't make me too warm if I'm cooking in a hot kitchen. The collar comes up high around the neck, but is notched out in front so that's it's not restricting or unpleasant to wear. It has a convenient pocket on the sleeve to keep small chef's tools on hand yet out of the way. I use this pocket for my MP3 player. The top washes well and with it being black, I don't need to worry about bleaching any food stains such as splattered tomato sauce. Overall, I'm very pleased with it."
"a gift, no problem"
These are great and what I was expecting
gave it as a gift..very well detailed
Got these for my daughter she said they kept her feet warm and dry
Comfortable. Put a lot of miles on them.
"These are my new favorite ""no show"" socks, with the Hue brand padded heel no-shows coming in a close second. I like these because, unlike most ""no-show"" socks, these socks really do not show when wearing most flats. For better or worse, people will think you are not wearing any socks. Also, these have clear gel grips on the outer bottom and on the inner heel to keep them in place on your foot and keep your foot from sliding around in your shoes or when wearing without shoes."
Super cute and looks less like one piece than I expected... I would definitely buy this again!  My kid looks adorable in it.
"Most of my life I have been echanted by eastern mysticism, now I'm living it. I would like to personally thank this company and all companies who produces such clothing and apparel for thoses who like to express thier views, ways of life and culture especially of this nature. The Aum symbol has a deep meaning to me and this shirt has a great way of expressing that. The shirt itself is a great fit and looks great on me. I'm looking forward of buying more clothes like this that express the deep meanings of my soul and spirit."
"I have an allergy to UVB rays and have previously broken out in hives at the beach, even with a  70 sun block from Neutrogena. So I bought this shirt and it protects me from the sun. I have seen people where similar ones in the water. I take it off when i go for a quick swim and then put it on when I am sitting in the sun. My only complaint is that it comes pretty high up on your neck and is a little tight there."
"This is beautiful. Whether the magnets really do something or not doesn't really matter to me.

My only gripe was the pin in the tool that was sent along with this bracelet, to remove links-- B E N T .

I had to spend $15 for a jeweler to do it for me.

Bummer."
These earrings are pretty... very comfortable to wear!!
They are colorful and the metal doesn't irritate my ears.
Slightly cheaper made then I expected but for the price I'm not complaining. It was a huge hit for his Halloween costume
I love these. So thick and super comfortable.
"Great stylish shoes and really comfortable when doing lots of walking, fits as expected and is the reason why I have three pairs in three different colors. Material of shoes is durable and nice as long as you take care of them they will last."
They are a bit loose. But still work great.
Beautiful well made top. I got a medium and am 5'7 170 pounds pear shaped 36c
"Love this bra, Great fit, very confy!!!"
"It's good looking, but obviously cheaply made - for yhe price, I'm OK with it"
"Like all trimfit products,  the quality is great! Cotton blend makes it super comfy and breathable, while still washing well. The elastic is comfortable and thick so it doesn't squeeze the waist. My son is overly sensitive to tight clothes and these don't bother him at all."
this watch is very nice but the band is like it is backwards and the end of the band sticks up towards the front of the face of the watch
"These underwear fit well.  They are very comfortable.  The waist band has not ""rolled down"" ever.  They stand up very well in the washing machine.  They are just a great product, and I will buy them in the future."
Perfect! Thank you so much.
Needed a wider width but the length was perfect for both feet otherwise.
"Gorgeous bathing suit! I'm 5'4 and 150 lbs and got a large. In retrospect I probably should have gone with a slightly smaller one, it sort of bags at my tummy. But for a new mom with all sorts of fun new tummy marks its awesome not having to worry about people staring me and my cesection scar down!"
I gave it as a  gift - a very successful idea!
Granddaughter loved this.  Great for the price!
Arrived on time.  Coloring is fantastic.  I've received many compliments.  I may consider buying another pair as a gift for a friend.
"Love it . Bought it last year and still hold up its shape . But I never put in dryer , just hung dry"
just what we hope for.
Great shoes - look and feel good on your feet.
"This is an elegant set, and the diamond accents are a nice touch.  For size comparison:  The earring pearls are just slightly smaller than the ring pearl.  The ring pearl is just slightly smaller than the pendant pearl.

I do wish that the gold in the ring was as obvious as the gold in the earrings and the pendant.  But I'm happy that the ring has three small diamonds, which gives it extra sparkle.  The pearl has a nice luster, and the sizing was accurate.

I am satisfied with this purchase."
Lob e them
I'm a plus size girl and It was a little snug on me but wearable.  Soft comfortable material!
"I love these shoes!! They are so soft nd warm but not too warm that they make my feet sweat. My only complaint and the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is bc they run pretty big. I normally wear a size 7.5-8 in womens. I have a average width foot. Maybe a tad bit wider than average but Ive never had to wear a size wide width shoe. I say this bc I bought this shoe in size 7 bc it was all they had in the color I wanted. I was hoping Id stretch them to fit. Well good thing I didn't buy bigger bc these definitely run big. As you can see from my pictures, they are a bit loose. I put some regular socks on with them and the fit is perfect but I hadnt intended to wear them with socks. Im definitely keeping them bc they were so cheap, are incredibly comfortable and really adorable. I plan to order another pair in a different color now nd Ill be sizing down even more, which will be about 2 sizes smaller than my normal show size."
Very comfortable and they keep my feet warm. I even wear them while doing errands.
Perfect for my 7 year olds allowance.
"Nice quality, did not fit true to size so returned. Very pretty suit top. I was just on a time crunch so had to go out and buy one."
"I purchase these for my heel spur, I ordered a ""New"" pair but received used. The insoles has a lot of dirt/stain on it, they look worn out. But still, I decided to keep them because I really need them badly for my heel pain, so it's just my luck! I felt bad and disappointed.  I give 4 stars for comfort and give good support for my high arches feet."
"This is a great open toe slingback.  The maple sugar color is a true nude, and works well with just about every summer outfit.  The black patent is a classic as well.

With respect to the fit of the shoe:
- The toe box is on the ""narrower"" side, but that's because your feet will naturally slide forward with a 3"" heel.  I personally did not have any issues with the ""narrowness"" of the toe box/strap, but people who wear this shoe with pantyhose might find their foot slipping forward a bit.
- The heel height is pretty comfortable. Like the other shoes in the Nike Air series, this shoe is padded and very comfortable to walk on.
- I found the shoe to be true to size with all of my other Cole Haan heels. No issues there.

The one criticism that I have for the shoe is that the holes for the ankle strap aren't in the best place for me. I seem to be between holes, so I may have a cobbler punch an extra hole for me (otherwise the ankle strap keeps slipping down when I walk)."
Good quality at a good price. Heavyweight t-shirt
Very comfortable and stylish. I own this shirt in several colors. It is my go-to shirt for most of the fall and winter. Does tend to pill if you put it in the dryer.
my niece loves it.
Slightly loose around the 32 waist but just as I like them to be for a man of my age
"Wow! These shoes are super soft leather and are so cute! I love them! I don't know why people are saying they smell like chemicals, they just smell like leather shoes."
"These shoes fit true to size. I ordered the 6.5 and while I worried that they might be a little loose in the heel, they have been fine all day with stockings.  I've been wearing them all day at work, and no aching feet yet. The heel is a nice manageable height that looks good. If they had these in a camel or brown, I'd order them as well!"
"Our twins LOVE this costume!  When we got it we put it on each of them, and they ran around hugging each other!  So cute!  I also love that it giggles!"
"Runs small but perfect for a slender man, 162 lb."
These boots are beautiful and fit wonderfully. I just love them. They're stylish and jazzy. They go with multiple outfits.
Purchased for my daughter for her Dorothy costume at Halloween. She loves these shoes. Wore them all night outdoors for trick or treat and then again to a fancy dance with her father in November. Comfortable and sparkly! Nice heel height for a second grader.
Love these fit over wanna be s
"Very good for the price. I had a Rolex years ago, this watch is probably as accurate. Fortunately, and amazingly the band fit perfectly out of the box. That's  good, because it would be a nightmare to try to adjust by removing or adding links."
Excellent.. Great for big girls. Is better buy median size more that girls fit
"Although it's slightly large to fit in a pocket, this makes a great anti-pickpocket wallet that comes in handy when traveling.

You attach one end to your belt (or an available belt loop, etc), and your walled becomes cabled to your body. Although I'm sure that a strong enough tug would pull it apart (although I doubt the steel cable would break!), it's much more secure than a conventional wallet.

Overall, the construction quality seems very good, and while it's not the most fashionable looking wallet you'll ever own, it does help you stay secure.

Definitely recommended for the price."
Old School suspenders with a EZ hook-up. Works for Office or on the job. Nice quality and will last. NOLA G2
"Comfortable, look good.  Slippery when wet."
thanks for good product
"They came without the hole for the button opened so I had to cut one but, other than that. They are cute."
Great quality but much larger than expected.  Good thing little boys grow fast
I order this jacket expect it to be small but it was true to size. My little girls is 2years old but on the chubby side. so I buy a little bigger but it was really big on her will save it for next year. the color is awesome but looks like it would stain easy. I have to spray scotch guard on it to protect it. but its heavy duty material. Next year she will wear it.
I cannot believe how very lightweight this hat is. Blocks the sun and you can unzip the top off if you just want a visor.
"Fit great, had enough room with my 2x, looks good too."
this is just too cool.  you can't go wrong with coconuts.  you can't go wrong with bikini tops.  This is both in one.  Sweetness!
bigger than it looks but my daughter loves it!
"My husband loves it so much, I bought it for him and he wears it all day long! We're both very happy with our UGG scuffs!"
The only thing I don't like is the strap keeps slipping into the longest position.
I ordered these in many colors.  great comfy bra for multiple chest sizes and cute with many types of outfits
"I love it, but have not found a suitable occasion to wear it!"
Good Quality. Great Price
These worked surprisingly well. I bought these in the winter because my legs were cold but I didn't feel like wearing full long johns under my pants so I got these. They kept my legs very warm and comfortable and I was impressed by the fact that they didn't slide down to my ankles like a lot of leg warmers do. Even after consistent use during the winter and a little bit of stretching around my calves they still stayed up. Occasionally if I did a lot of running around they slid down slightly but it was no more than an inch or so.
"I finally caved and bought one of these pumping bras with my second child. I hate myself for not ordering it sooner! I used to sit and hold the breastpump and think about all the things I could be doing rather than holding that pump! Now I strap it on and a lot of times I forget I have it on and I have pumped for twice as long as I used to... therefore, I have more milk in the bottle! I almost bought the medela brand since that is the brand of my pump. But after a little research I read this was the better review bra. So glad I purchased it!"
I returned this item because it was too small. The customer service provided by Coshare and Amazon was excellent and I'll certainly consider purchasing another product in the future.
so comfrtable
I love this shoe. I have a VERY wide foot and the shoe fit perfectly. I can't purchase from a regular shoe store because my foot is so wide.  I ordered size 6 EE in the brown color.  There was no break in period at all. I plan on ordering the same shoe in another color as son as I finish this review.
This bag is exactly what I was looking for! A pretty nice size and is really cute
My daughter's favorite color is green.  She loves this watch.  She had been looking for a big face watch.  She has it on today.
"This wrap-around leather bracelet is really cool! I've never worn anything like this before- I've always worn silver; chains and pendants, etc. I was pleasantly surprised when I got this! It has 3 different length snaps so it can custom fit almost anyone. It came in a really neat little colorful drawstring bag, too. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
Item received quickly and earrings were exactly as described. Nice finish and just the right size for intended gifted. He loved them. Backings seemed pretty secure. Nice product for the price.
So very comfortable! Very happy! Looking forward to purchasing more in the very near future!
"I have had these shoes for 5 years and they have been awesome (just checked my purchase date and I couldn't believe it)!  I regularly walk a few miles at a time on both sidewalks and dirt or gravel trails, and I'm amazed how well these have held up.  Lately, I've been walking 7 miles or more, and my feet are pretty sore after all that, but I attribute that to the cushioning breaking down after all these years. They were very comfortable for the first few years. They definitely don't look very old, although the fabric is starting to get slightly worn/ripped on a few edges (but you have to really look to notice it).  I've always had great quality from Merrell and these are no exception.  If I was still walking just 3 miles, these would be fine, and they would probably be fine for 7 if they were newer."
"Thanks to previous reviews from other ladies, I went 1 size up since I have wide feet and I like this shoes. Very we'll made and comfy since I went a size up. Don't hesitate to buy it!!!!"
true to size fits good
This dress is cut small so keep that in mind. I normally where a Large but because of the comments of it running small I got an XLG. Wow was I wrong. The XLG does not match the measurements on their chart. The large is more like a Small or XSmall.  Great customer service.  The vendor reimbursed me immediately.
"If anything, I'd say the size is a bit larger then expected, but we haven't washed and dried it enough yet to say for sure - but that would be the guess I'd take.  The quality is great though, the neck hole is fine, and the arm size.  The image is ""faded"" but to look like it's supposed to for the TV show image.

I'd have no problem recommending this to anyone, and I'm glad we got it - it was a fun gift from my 11 year old boy, to his Papa (knowing he likes the show even though he hasn't seen it) and my husband (who loves the show) found it super cute."
"The item is perfect for my plentiful collection of stud earrings. Sadly the hard plastic cover has a small break in it but it was very well priced so I'll keep it and it doesn't bother me at all.
Materials obviously aren't super high quality, which I wouldn't expect reading the reviews and paying so little, but they're good quality and will do it's job.
I'd order it again if need be!"
Great for prop to Indian costume.
Shirt is great. Washed well with no shrinkage or fade (first two washes).
Loved it fits perfectly
"Bought this for my wedding day because of rain in the forecast. Thankfully it didn't rain so we didn't need it but it poured the next day! It was fine, just like any umbrella."
Grandaughter loves them.
I went up a half size on these and so glad I did. I have them on right now and really like them. They feel comfortable and have just put them on a few minutes ago.
"love this shirt! originally bought the wine, and once I received that I also ordered the blue.  one thing to mention - the red is called 'wine' but I think 'maraschino cherry' is a more appropriate name once i saw the color."
"Wish it were better quality material, and now wonder how to get the real thing."
pricey but worth having
Have purchased this brand for  many years! Best ones!
"Shapewear helps with your shape, but I actually wear it for back support...so helpful!"
"Solid Indoor Soccer Shoes. The build & finish is very good and the materials are high quality. They seem to have more structure in the fore-foot then an equivalent Nike shoe. I like the structure because it provides a little bit of protection to your foot. The touch is very nice.

No issues with the soles, they are holding up and provide sufficient grip.

I think they look really slick on my feet, the look alone was a mental boost when playing. It' just a matter of - Look Good, Feel Good, Play Good. They are bright green with purplish/pinkish stripes.

I play on synthetic turf with those little rubber sand things, the neoprene ankle cuffs keep most of the junk out. I had regular Adidas' Sambas and I was always having to empty my shoes.

Made in Indonesia."
Great socks . Nice and warm. I have narrow feet and they're perfect. Wouldn't fit a wide foot.
"So far, I really like this product.  I've been using it morning and night and my skin feels great!  I have extremely sensitive skin, so I am always wary when it comes to trying new products but I've had good success with this one.  There is not an over bearing scent to it, which is great.  There is a slight tint to the cream and it blends beautifully into my skin.  It doesn't lay on top either, it literally blends beautifully and then is absorbed without any greasy or caky after effect.

The applicator is really smooth and contoured to fit the eye very well.  It is designed to give you some circulation while you apply it which is TERRIFIC for puffy eyes.

Over all I am extremely pleased with the product, although I haven't noticed any significant changes under the eye with regard to my dark circles, I have noticed that my skin feels really good and I do like the brightening effect it has on my overall skin appearance.

I will continue using for a few more weeks and post any updates with regard to improvement."
Cute for 2 1/2 year old.
"I am normally a size 8, and I ordered an 8. They fit fine and very comfortable. Highly recommend."
"Material seems thin but fits well.

thanks!"
"I think they are great, but I am not sure the person I gave them to thinks so.  To him ""socks are socks."""
I love this bra. I have bought a few from this brand before and they are my favorite everyday bras. The only problem is the band is a little loose but since the shoulders are not adjustable I don't think I could go down a size.
"So far it's been great! Weather from 30F to -15F, I have stayed perfectly warm and comfortable for the half hour or so that I have to be out in those temps.  Also, very well made."
After reading some of the reviews I decided to order this one size larger and I'm glad I did. I got this for my step daughter who is a size 18 usually a 1X but I bought the 2x in the shirt and it seems to still fit her a little snug but not as bad as it would have if I went true to size. She absolutely loves the little rhinestones across the front and the length is perfect for her short frame she's only 5'5 and its the perfect length. The fabric isn't heavy at all which is great for the summer heat. It isn't low cut like many other shirts yet is still feminine A++. Overall this is very well made adorable and great quality. I would definantly recommend just order a size up. I did recieve a promotional discount for the exchange of my honest and unbiased review.
very comfortable and fit perfectly...
Love this shirt! Long enough for leggings.
This is a really awesome coat.  Im a California transplant of 30 years so my blood is really thinned out. I had a business trip to Chicago where temps were to be between 14 and 44.  I went outside with this coat in that temp range from the lowest to the high 44 and this coat kept me warm the whole time with no issues.  The only issue I had was not getting a warm enough scarf or hat (so don't forget those).  What I love most about this coat is that its lightweight.  I can stuff it into my smaller backpack when getting on a flight. And I can even use this coat in California on our colder mornings.  This is now my new go-to coat...literally for all cold or cool weather.  I won't be wearing anymore of my bulky coats from this point forward.
"durable, able to put handwarmers into the zipper, can tighten around the wrists so they don't slip off"
"These are super cute boots, and I love the length. They actually do come up above the top of the knee. The color is a little bit much when you first take them out of the box, but pair it with something neutral like black or white, and they're perfect. I bought them to supplement my Harley Quinn costume, and they look great. I plan to wear them with sweater dresses and also with leggings. As far as arch support, they are not the greatest, but they also aren't bad. I can wear them for hours. Well worth the money."
These pants are so comfortable and cute.  The fabric does soil easily and they are difficult to iron but other than that I love them.
"Daughter loves the look. The shoe is long enough with a little room to go (she's currently wearing crocs 12, but the toes are touching at the top, so this was her graduation to 13s...) BUT, the elastic over the top of the foot is very tight! Also, the back of the shoe gives her a blister on her heel. I added socks hoping it would stop the chaffing, but it still rubs on her. Hate to give them up already bc the length really is perfect, tho. I'll ask her to wear them a little longer hoping they break in and feel better, otherwise I think they'll go in the donation box."
Very nice and light and I am able to wear in the show without it changing colors. I would buy it again.
Carhartt is always a quality product
Excellent shoe and super comfortable
11 year old loved them
"I live in Alaska. I needed warm boots for snowblowing. These boots are great!! They run small, but I knew this. I usually wear a 7.5. I purchased a size 8 and they fit perfectly. They are snug and warm. Exactly what I was looking for."
"I am 5'4"" and usually wear a 44D bra size, 2X or 18. The adjustable straps are wonderful and the shelf bra actually took care of my girls. I agree that the top is not very long.  If I were taller, this would be a definite problem(the reason I only gave 4 stars), but this time I am thankful to be short.  The quality seems very good."
Bought this for my elderly Aunt for Christmas gift and she loves it. The toggles are easier for her to secure than buttons. She wore it back to the nursing home and was showing it off to the other residents.
These clogs look great. They are true to size. They also are very comfortable.
"This blouse came in a really small package and was really wrinkled. I had to put it in the dryer for a bit to soften up. Once I tried it on though, it fit really well. I still have a bit of a pouch in my stomach area due to giving birth 4 months ago. So I like that the flounce part of the shirt covers my stomach area just perfectly. It also gives a great look. I plan to wear to work with slacks and heels.
I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"Not scratchy. The x large fits my 40"" bust and the sleeves are super easy to move it. Doesn't bind anywhere, fits just like on the model. I usually order a large, I went up 1 size and happy I did."
"Perfect for my 14 yr old unsociable son. He loved it. Got an XL because he is very tall and a little husky. Sometimes these shirts fit small. I would say that is the case here, because he normally wears L and the XL fits him like a L."
"These glasses have nice eye coverage, a flattering frame style and perfect extra magnification for reading outdoors.  I am very satisfied."
Loved it! it went perfect! Was a prom day success!
"Fits great and looks warm, get ready for winter"
It is exactly as described. The bears are held in the pockets by one stitch so they can be left or easily removed. Very happy with this purchase.
Great fit and very flattering!  Order a size down tho...I am usually a 4 but wear a 2 in KUT jeans
Really like these the price was perfect.
Love this! goes great with leggings under a tunic.  You can make it as long or as short under my clothes I want.
"I horseback ride during the winter and these socks are perfect, warm and fit in cowboy boots. They are not bulky, a bit coarse, but they feel great when you are wearing them. Worth the price!"
U have to buy 1 size bigger then your size. And it will still be a good fit. That is what I did.
got the boot cut going and they run a lil longer then normal jeans do. still lookin good and a good buy.
"I love these pants, they are comfortable, throughout the day they don't stick to you, feel like they wick moisture away and stay comfortable to your skin.  I'm not saying they are wicking material, they just feel like they do.  They are great for the office and most any casual event."
"Straps are a little bothersome, but overall a good shoe"
Bought it for my husband.  Seems to be holding up great.
"Bought this for a friend, and it has held up fantastically!
A year through high school (so far) and no problems with the backpack!
Arrived before expected, as well."
"I bought this for my wife with the initial of our daughter on it, and she absolutely loves it. The pendant itself is very beautiful, and the chain is a good length so it sits just as she likes it. I definitely see us adding more necklaces with new initials as time goes by."
"After wearing my old pair of Sorel slippers down to threads over 10 years, it was time to replace them, so naturally I looked to Sorel again. These leather slippers appear to be even sturdier than the old felt ones, so I imagine they will last for at least 10 years. My only rather minor gripe is there is a bit of a lip to the back of the slipper - not low enough to ignore, but not high enough to keep the slipper holding firm to the heal as I walk. I can't really wear socks with these yet, but I imagine as the fleece compacts over time (as they always do), that issue will resolve itself."
"I have small feet and liked that these fit nice and snug.  The only complaint I would have is that they are a bit narrow, making my feet tend to slide off the side just a bit.  But aside from that, they are great and I know I will get a lot of use out of them once the weather gets too warm to wear closed slippers."
"Buy the damn thing! It's super cool!
retro styling, functional. Chicks kinda dig it. I don't always use the calculator. It's so light and thin I forget I'm wearing it. Lasts FOREVER AND EVER. Probably going to worth thousands in 20 years. Cool little gift for anybody."
"I have been using one of these in the two pack for my gardening work each week, and it works great.  Very thin material, so you hardly notice it's on.  It dries very quickly as well.  I made the mistake of washing it with some nylon work pants I have for the same gardening task, and the color stained my white shirt, but again, it's for gardening, so not a big deal.  I would definitely buy another pair of these if they ever wore out.  Highly recommend."
I've become a BIG Skechers fan.
"Fortunately, I read the reviews here before purchasing, and ordered a size larger.
The fit is excellent, but I bought a 13 and usually wear a 12.  Still have a bit of room for heavy socks.
I like the construction and style, though as others mentioned, they can be tricky to get on at first."
"I use this as a briefcase with my Mac Air 13. The Air fits in the main pocket, but it does not fit in the zipper pockets on the sides. I put my iPad Mini in the side pocket and some cables in the other. Stylish and great for travel."
"Cute, my 8 year old loves it. Pretty cheaply made though."
Fun and flirty...Loved wearing it.
Its fits well and stylish for a athletic man
Its a regular black zip up hoodie
This pintuck skirt looks just like the picture. I got it for my daughter who will be 14 and wears a 0 in woman's. I put fit as expected because I expected it to run small. So this small size I got her would be an extra small for a JR. or xxs for a woman's size. The color is as the picture and it has a zipper on the side. I like the length too. It will not be too short on her. She is 5' and it comes just above her knees. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
Terrific Keds ...just what I wanted!
This item is just like on the picture . It fits well and look like real gold. Iam planning to order another one before it runs out of stock. I always receive compliments when I wear it love it.
I brought this hat to match my bibs and to keep my head warm. I like the snug fit and the warmth of the hat. Plus it looks good. I am very happy with my purchase.
"This jeans fit my SO perfectly and she really likes them,  They have some stretch to them and so they are not like the cheaper jeans that chafe if they are a bit tight.  She has been wearing them frequently and really loves them.  They make her look good and sexy too.  I would recommend these jeans for any woman that wants to look hot."
"Simply  a beautifully made, high quality sweater!"
I have a size 7-7.5 shoe and these were still a bit bigger than I thought they would be.  I need to wear these daily for work on construction sites so I was looking for comfort.
Runs larger than my last pair. This the best brand of shoe!!
"I liked it - it's got a bit of weight to it, which I appreciate as it makes me feel it's made of quality fabric. I believe it ran true to size, however I'm 6ft and the bottom of the dress came up a past my knees and into my thigh region, which I really don't think looked great. The arm holes felt a little small for my upper arms - I don't know maybe I need to tone up or something. I liked the gold zipper on the back a lot - totally made the dress look nice. Overall a beautiful dress, just kinda short for a tall person and maybe not the greatest for people who don't do upper arm workouts."
Bought as a gift for my wife. Fits perfectly and she loves it.
perfect fit for my larger sunglasses
"A little wide, but the length is true to size. Good quality. The sole is holding up well and gets good traction on wood and tile flooring. The fleece is also holding up well-- no tearing after about 4 months of wear. I'm utterly unwilling to pay a hundred bucks for slippers, so these are a good option if you want something more affordable, but that will last, too."
"am a big fan of the Lord of the rings/Hobbits books and love the movies. My wife and i decided we want to go to New Zealand on a trip in a year or so. as a kick off to our start of savings i thought i would get us a set of rings but did not want to pay hundreds and do not want crap. did research for a week and after going through all the reviews i took a chance. Was very presently surprised and loved how the ring looks and feels . the etching was very good but one major complaint was it is hard to read.
an easy trick is a permanent black marker like sharpie. cover the ring surface with it then  wipe it off. if you like it darker do it again.

did this trick on one of my rings and it looks awesome. after i even cleaned it with a bit of soap and water to make sure nothing comes off and it still stays in the etching"
"Too much stretch, to enough hold."
"This is a pink lotion in a gorgeous glass bottle, and it has the most wonderful fragrance.  Even the pink box the bottle comes in is gorgeous.

This is a pump bottle, and pressing the button on top squirts out a stream of the heavenly lotion.  You can aim it to get the lotion exactly where you want it, since the stream is thin and the lotion comes out with pinpoint accuracy.

Now to describe this light, subtle fragrance.  The jasmine is the first topnote to meet my nostrils.  And everyone loves jasmine.  A white rose is the next note. I would have chosen water hyacinth as the middle note, although this mentions sandlewood (which would be a bassnote) and lemon for the middle note. And yes, the lemon is there, but I had to search for it, which is for me unfortunate as it is the most favorable note in fragrances for my body chemistry.

There is also something of water, clean laundry, sunshine, with rainclouds on the horizon.  The lemon peeks out in the dry down.  The initial happy aroma quickly dies down into a skin scent.  What is left is a silky, watery moisture drenching my thirsty skin, and I keep putting my arm to my nose to inhale the soft, delicate sunny scent.  And I love the artistic, subliminally phallic bottle.  It's not only gorgeous, it's suggestive, especially with the unsubtle word ""BODY"" on it.

This is all what a top of the line body lotion with scent should be.  The pretty box, the glamorous and unique bottle it houses, the delicious moisturization without grease, oil, or heaviness, combined with the elegant high quality, nature-inspired fragrance that lingers in the background on my skin, all speak volumes about the seriously decadent attitude Burberry takes toward its line of perfumes and lotions.  Burberry means quality, and is an English version of the House of Chanel in many ways."
Perfect size for the jewelry I make!!
Bought for my husband and he really likes these better than others we have gotten before.
"I love this bra. It is very good quality for the price. I didn't want to spend too much on a strapless bra that I don't wear that often, but also didn't want one that was horrible quality either. This definitely fit the bill. Doesn't slide down much at all and the cups' lines are not really visible through material like some other (more expensive) strapless bras I have had. I got my normal size and it is perfect."
Boyfriend doesnt like wearing jackets so this is the prefect light weight jacket for him.
"While I didn't buy one over Amazon, I did get one of these for a friend at a collectibles warehouse.

The Bender hat is soft, comfortable (albeit a little lumpy), and serves its hilarious purpose. The antenna bit IS pretty long, but it isn't a problem. Overall, a really fun thing to pull over your head! Worth the purchase, I can tell you.

The only possible drawback (and its kind of a stretch) is that it looks like you killed Bender and decided to wear his ""skin"" over your head, like some kind of battle trophy. It might be the emptiness in the stunned expression of Bender's bulging eyes. This applies doubly for the Nibbler hat."
"Beautiful sandals! As usual, you have to go with half a size up in PLV"
"This KWTTS092M_NAVY is very much a sports shirt in the sense that it feels identical to jersey style fabric, such as a basketball jersey, which makes it ideal for active wear on hot summer days. The construction and material are acceptable. The shirt is about as luxurious as it would pass on a golf-coarse, but would be slightly tacky in a blazer.  The fabric is Polyester, so it breathes well and is much silkier than cotton. The fit and color are very close to the product image here on Amazon and the size is accurate. I am 5'9, weigh 155lbs, and I bought an Asia L (US M). It fits perfectly."
"Amazing comfort and fit. Buy these in bulk, you won't regret it. And, my junk stays tucked it. Did I mention the comfort, and how my junk is nicely secured? Love these."
"My daughter has sensory processing disorder. Finding shoes that are comfortable for her is very difficult. These are the first women's size shoes I have purchased for her and she loves them. I had previously bought Skech-Airs for Kids, but she out grew those sizes. The only minor complaint is that the foot liner over the memory foam tends to come unattached after a couple of months."
"Awesome. Bought this the week before my wedding to use as my ""something blue"" underneath my tea-length dress and I got so many compliments on it. It peeped out just enough at the bottom and was just adorable. Also made my dress a little poofier which was great for the shape of my body. So happy I got this. Hopefully I can find more uses for it in the future too!"
this was a gift and he loved the shirt the Quilted lining and fits beautifully will definitely reorder
great sandal. fit is great. comfortable.
"This bag looks great. I didn't like the leather straps too much because they look kind of fake, but overall the bag looks pretty cool. I took a star off because after about 2 years the bag started to tear and eventually I could no longer use it. But it wasn't that expensive and I still got about two years use out of it."
I like that the item was as described and seem genuine like publicized. I have received nothing outside of compliments about my birthstone earrings.
Can't beat the price for the durability and size.  I got 2 and they have traveled with my boys on camping trips and overnight trips from home.
Slytherin merchandise for the Slytherin family.
"I initially ordered these in a size 8 because I normally take an 8 in a boot and a 7.5 in a shoe.  However, because they are open toe and you would not wear socks with these I had to return them for a 7.5...even then I still have a little room.  They are very comfortable between the soft nubuck suede material and the ""do-able"" height.  I ordered these in the jeans blue color (which is a lovely greyish blue shade) and I must say they look fantastic with so many things.  Very high quality shoe-boot.  I am very happy with this purchase."
As advertised. Great for the price.
My son skates and he likes the thickness and durability of these pants.
Kinda not what I expected but they do the job.
"great bag, big!"
Love these boots. The first wear or two was to break them in because initially they seem a bit narrow. I have both the brown and the black. I love that it's two styles in one. I've worn them up and under pants for work and rolled down with leggings casually. I have to wear thin socks with them but other than that I am thrilled!
Great belt! Careful to not get a squeaky one.
Love this jacket very pretty
"Boot looks great! what I would deem as medium length cleats, Perfect!"
"I wear size 10-D, and these fit perfectly. No heel slippage, and they seemed to conform to my feet. I use these for indoor pickleball, and was impressed with the combination of light, firm construction that handled the pounding I put on them, a roomy toe box and immediate break-in.

Court shoes should have good lateral support, and should not torque flex like running shoes. These were just right. By the middle of my first game,  I forgot about my feet. I only remembered I was wearing new shoes when I felt how comfy they were.

If they last, I'll buy again."
"I've trusted Mario Badescu products and their spa for years, but just recently tried this Rose Hips Nourishing Oil.  I use a few drops on my face at night before putting on a moisturizer.  It feels good, goes on quickly and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily.  I like it because of the antioxidants in the Vitamin C.  I don't have issues with dry spots, especially during the summer."
I've been wearing Propet shoes year round for about ten years without a problem. From summer fun to shoveling snow they wear well. Finally replaced one pair because the Velcro loosened up a bit and I like a snug fit. Terrific shoes for men who have problems tying shoes. Well worth the price of them.
super cute and fluffs right up
"Definitely not navy but I still like this scarf very much. Bought two, one in gray and this one, ""winter navy"" - it is really more of a slate blue, but very pretty and light. I like it!"
I bought this Samurai Sword Katana Umbrella for my son-in-law...he is really into Anime and this was the perfect present to give him. It looks like a real Katana when it is strapped on your back. Just slip off the black carry sleeve and it is a fully functioning umbrella. It is very sturdy and the handle looks like a real sword. I purchase this product at a discount for my honest review and it is so cool!!! I love it!!
"Purchase as part of a gift for Christmas 2016. Love it !!!!
Will have to update post once hubby sees his gift."
These sandals run about a half size too big. They are a good quality and are great for our water walks and barnyard walks because they are easy to clean too. We have been everywhere in these and have not slipped yet.
Great. I only find them online.
Absolutely love this piece. It was made quite well and adjusts to fit comfortably. And looks great by itself or under a fun tank top. Really want more!
"I used to wear these slippers years ago, and stopped because the sizing was off.  A friend suggested that I try them again, and I am pleased to say that they are everything that I remember being good about them.  True to size and width, very comfortable!"
"These are some of the best ""Teacher Shoes"" I've come across. There aren't many things that I'll splurge on, but quality shoes are one of them. These are incredibly comfortable and have stood the test of a few months of teaching very well. Occasionally, my pinky toes will get a little rubbed or irritated, but never anything bad. I get compliments on them constantly. Can be worn alone or with socks, and both ways are cute in my opinion! Will definitely be sticking with Dansko in the future for shoes made for standing all day."
"A little small and when I tried to pull up over my calf, one ripped.  Now that I know not to try and pull up so much, they are fine."
Cute sandles. Fits perfectly fine.
Fits as expected in all areas except for the onesie is a bit lengthy. The print is adorable. I got it in a larger size with a different color scheme also
"This might just be my favorite shirt in my collection right now.  Quality material, respectable construction.  I would buy in other colors but I have a rule against buying the same item over and over again.  A great buy!"
They are beautiful! !!
Just as Advertised. Simple and clean and a nice quality for the price.
Fun product.  Fit as expected.  No issues to report.
Very cute... looks good with my Clarks boots
I'd heard about this stean curler before but finally took the time to try it it is amazing I don't believe I left the curlers in for more than 15-20 minutes tops and I have more curls that I know what to do with
"Holy quality! These are so soft inside and out! I love them so much. Super high quality, and expensive materials. I love them so much! I ranked them as slightly too large only because they have half an inch at the toe, however they are still very comfortable."
It's extremely comfortable. Will buy again from them anytime
"I bought this for a friend for her birthday, and it is officially her new favorite hat. Very well designed; functional, great quality, and yet super adorable. Definitely a high recommendation on this one!"
This is the 3 rd one I gave bought.  I keep leaving them PIaces. They are small and light and good quality.
This watch is very powerful on being shinny. I love it! I hade very nice compliments with this watch. It's worth money!
Beautiful color for shoes and fit very good.
"I bought this as a cover-up for my trip to Thailand/Cambodia during which time I planned to visit numerous Temples, in which your shoulders must be covered.  As a tropical country I anticipated the heat but did not want to burden myself with long sleeved tops, which would be unbearable. These were cool and comfortable and were worn over camis/vests/tank tops and were totally appropriate.  i Ieft them untied throughout."
This is a very comfortable shoe by Clark's. I ordered the light tan last year and loved the shoe so much I decided to buy the shoe in olive. Love it too. I wear a size 5M and have a high arch. With medium socks this shoe is a perfect and oh so comfortable fit. Would recommend for comfort as well as style.
The costume arrived very quickly. It has a very flattering fit and appropriate to wear at work. The purple looks great with the black.
Perfect size .  I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  She had one that was too small and one that was too large.  This one was just right. She loves all the compartments and the zipper closing.  Has had many compliments so far.
"The tank works--it made my back look completely smooth. I could even wear a bra underneath it and the back would still look pretty smooth. The downside is that the tank completely squashes your boobs. I have a nice sized rack but after putting this on I felt like I had entered the realm of A-cups (I am exaggerating a bit but it looked and felt like my chest was bound).

I decided to keep it and I figure I will wear a padded Victoria Secret bra that has been languishing in my drawer since it is so overpadded. Hopefully, the padding will be enough to make my chest look a bit closer to its normal size."
"My husband just loved the Haggar shorts and I loved them you machine wash hang on hanger NO IRONING , yeppie!  ...I an glad I bought all colors..."
"Have arthritis in both hands lymphedema in one can wear for both compressions, a godsend.  If I try to wear lymphedema gloves my fingers swell and cut off circulation.  Therapist said these were great!"
I like it!  I did order a size smaller as someone suggested in a review.  You may want to wear a  cami  under it its a bit thin.  I will be able to wear it with many things.
"So cute , bought for work its long enough that its flattering but not to long that its old ladyish.. Its perfect for the look I'm going for!"
"Comfy, cute!"
"I bought these for my daughter, she is thrilled!  They run a bit large but not large enough to go down in size.  She is wearing heavier socks and all is great!"
These shoes are my husband's all time fave!
This hat runs big.  I usually wear a L or XL and had to send back the original and order a small which fits as expected now.
"These shoes are light weight but have a nice insole. I run around 20-30 miles a week and for the past three months they have been wonderful. They also dry out very quickly. My wife has three pairs and from now on, these will be all we run in."
"I'm 5'3, it's pretty short!! Not lined. Might need a slip or leggings of some type."
great stable running shoe for pronators. Been using this series for over a decade and it doesn't disappoint.  Keeps my pronation in check while providing the room in the toe area that I need.  I always go up a size just to ensure that I have the room that I need.  Solid cushion in the heel area as well.
I bought this for my brother-in-law to go on a key ring. He loves to fish so I thought he would like this. He didn't. He loved it! Very well made considering the parts are minute. Made in the USA I believe. Very satisfied with this purchase. My brother-in-law is hard to please.
"LOVE this jacket! Material is warm, soft & sleek. I have received so many compliments on it. I ordered my regular size medium & it fits good but is a little snug if I have a big sweater underneath it. If you live in a cold region like I do you may want to think about ordering a size up. With that being said it has kept me very warm so far during Boston's cold winter days & nights.
It is important to add the manufacturers were great to work with! A few of my buttons came loose & they were misplaced. I emailed the company right away & they sent out replacement buttons immediately free of charge. Highly recommend this coat"
Great & very comfortable
Even after work I need some support. Excellent slippers for those with support issues
"UPDATE:

He's on his second pair now (he wore the first ones until they literally fell apart. Which was a long time. Definitely got our money's worth! Anyway, the new pair doesn't smell bad. At least I can't smell them just from him wearing them. So that's good! I would guess the first pair was a fluke? Not sure. Regardless, I highly recommend these! Half-sizes definitely order up. They will stretch slightly from wear, but not enough to accommodate a half-size.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

My husband loves these. I do not. Because they smell TERRIBLE. Seriously.

Thankfully, the smell fades over time, but initially, every time he wore them I thought something in the house was on fire. Or that the dog needed a bath. Or SOMETHING. Weird, unpleasant sheep-y smell? Not pleasant at all.

But my husband didn't mind it, and since he's the one wearing them, I can't really complain. But it's worth a mention, because it's a very strong smell.

He wears a 10.5 shoe and we ordered an 11. Fit fine with socks.

We used to buy similar slippers from the exclusive retailer in Maine (you know the one -- monogrammed tote bags and backpacks, etc.), but they wouldn't even last a whole year, and cost a fortune.

These are not cheap, but they last a LONG time, because of the rubber soles. They're worth the money.

They're by far my husband's favorite slippers, so I probably should've given them 5 stars, but honestly, that smell is bad. And it's not his feet that stink. It's the shoes."
These are comfortable and fit just like they are supposed to fit.  I am very picky when it comes to purchasing underwear and Jockey always makes a great product.  Glad I made this purchase
Average quality lightweight lounge wear
Perfect and very soft.  Will buy more.  Versatile
"I'm 6'0, 195 and this shirt fits great even at 180. I've bought them for years at the outlet mall (when this particular size and color is in).
They're a no brainer and I wear them to work."
Comfortable and warm on the feet.  The leather soles allow for temporary outdoor wear.  This is my second pair.
For great and has good detail
Very cute top.  Casual but looks great with shorts
"5'10"" 140 lbs. These fit me great. The material is soft, light and stretchy; very comfortable.
Update: Reduced to four stars. I ordered a second pair in khaki in the same size. They appear to be one size smaller. Of course, I ripped off the tag before trying them on, so now I'm just going to have to be a little sexier than I wanted..."
Great material love this bag
"Does what I wanted it to do, keep me warm. What else can I say? HIghly recommended, even for an old guy like me."
all the girls in my family wants a pair they are that lovely
Love these Reflex Tee from 90 degree. Going to order more.
I LAKE IT
Cute top wish the undergarment was a bit longer short to waist.
"Definitely gonna buy a half size bigger next time. But they look awesome and feel comfortable.  Haven't tried skating them yet, however I feel clumsy trying to skate on mid/high tops myself so I know my own answer but that's just personal preference. Still they delivered in every way I expected.  Being a bit smaller than I anticipated is not a good reason for me to knock off that fifth star off these bad boys. Like I said gonna get another pair later. Thanks!"
A gift which he couldn't wait for.  He loves it.
"Really love these hats, I have four different colors now. We all need a little extra protection from the strong rays of the sun. These hats are comfortable, adjustable and lightweight. Great for long walks or a day at the beach."
"Once you've worn a Sanuk flip flop with yoga mat (or in the case of the men's shoes, beer cozy) sole, you'll never want to wear any other brand.  These are the most cushioned, comfortable flip flops I've ever worn.  My daughter, grandkids and all my friends who've come over to the Sanuk flip flop agree.  They are the best hands down.  And they come in so many color options!"
"I absolutely love these sneakers.  Edgy but still kid appropriate.  In fact,  any age appropriate really."
"The legs are a bit longer on this than the same pant, in the same size, in Khaki color."
"very good jacket for a winter. maybe a little snug, so i bought one size up.now can wear it with sweater"
"I love these shoes. They are my second identical pair. Very comfortable, easy to wear and walk in. The tie is functional; one can tighten or loosen the vamp. I'll keep buying them"
Well made watch that has couple other uses besides just telling time.
These have held up very well and seem true to size. I'd buy them again if the price was right.
"I couldn't reccomend this bag enough! Great quality and durable. The inside doesnt hold much but I like that because it forces me to stay organized. You can hold a large wallet, cell phone and a couple tubes of make up without stretching it. With that said I love this more than any expensive designer bag I have ever had."
"I got this as a gift for my husband who teaches and he LOVES it! He uses it daily and it meets all his needs--has lots of pockets to hold his loot, books and pens, etc. It is durable, great color that has not faded and is comfortable to carry."
"I have been waiting for the price to come down on these boots.  Price was right, love the dark grey color, and excellent style, BUT boot was too small and too narrow in toe.  The funny thing is that I ordered a half size larger and tend to have a narrow foot.  Will defiantly try an other pair of earthies for style and comfort in the future."
I feel like I'm from Sunnyvale when I wear this!  I keep pretending I'm feeding Trevor rights and lefts unmercifully!
Pants fit loose and are perfect for working out in.
I work 10 hour shifts in a large hospital and am on my feet a lot. They are super comfy. I also have received a lot of compliments on them!
What a great looking chain at a great price.
"I have many pairs of Sugar shoes & always find them to fit perfectly!!!  I am always looking to see what they have that is new.  I do not usually buy shoes without trying them on 1st, but with Sugar shoes, I know how they are going to fit & have always enjoyed them!"
"Love this shoe and the overall quality and comfort, Olukai hits the mark again..."
Super comfortable nice quality easy to adjust I love them
Comfort comfort comfort. Style. Fit. Very happy with product.
I love it  ~~~~~~!!!!!!!!!!
"Gave it to a friend who makes jewelry, she loves it!"
I ordered a size up and wished I'd gone two. Love love love them just wish I'd gotten one size larger
Fit very nicely.....foot feels good
They worked. i had to do work in an extremely cold freezer.
It's rare to wrong with Converses.
"Very nice! Looks better than I expected and very flattering. I'm 5'2"" 120 pounds postpartum. Wanted a little post-baby self esteem boost and these are sexy as hell! I bought the L/XL size and I'm usually a 4-6 in pants. So, buy up to the large if you have hips at all. I'm a pretty small person and large fit me perfectly."
"Great fabric. Lots of pockets, and especially appreciate the zipped front pocket.  However, the fit is tighter than I anticipated, so others might want to consider a size up."
Purchased for my 6 year old grandson as a Christmas gift and he was thrilled when he opened the package.  The baseball styling is attractive.  Too early to tell about durability but I was satisfied with the workmanship of the shoe.
I love my ring. I love the lace design.
Perfectly matched my day of the dead dress!  So cute!
Awesome cap!
"So soft and light weight, perfect for my ""personal summers"". Can dress up with heels and a nice top, or dress down with sandals and t-shirt."
"Lovely shoe. but had to sell it. I bought a half size too big. It kept slipping out my foot. True to size, so buy your size."
"Excellent product and all appear to be well made - zippers, pockets and rollers. Bought for 6 yr old and is a little big to use as backpack maybe 1-2 more years but loves the rollers"
"I have received several pairs of earrings from this company. Trying to switch from studs to hoops. These are pretty, light and dainty. They also very well priced and I was concerned about the material and my ears getting infected. Have not had a single problem with that like I had with studs."
"Cotton panties not much to say, very comfortable."
Awesome!!! Simply love the skirt. Fit me as expected and the overall length is just right.
This is my second pair of these shoes. The most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.
This is one of my favorite collections of leggings.  Good quality for the price.
"Leggings are cute with the lace, but they're big enough that they tend to just bunch up in the knee area."
"Wife likes it. It's a little tight, but it's not enough to be a big problem."
"I have a 33"" inseam and usually take an xl for the length. No length here. about a 30' inseam."
"I love the feel of them, they were a little smaller than what I expected but not uncomfortable."
Wow what a big bag !! I really do like it. I especially like the deep pockets inside and out. The cloth seems to be very well sewn. And the leather straps made very well. Going to be using it a bunch ! Lucky Brand is very good at making bags.
"Love the shirt, but it was a little larger than I thought it would be."
"Levis are the best. My grand baby is tall and slender. It's hard shopping for jeans for him but, Levi fits him prefect each and every time."
My son is satisfied with the purchase.
"Too big, feet slide around in them. Returning."
I've owned bikla ls and kmd ls. These are right in line with those as most amazing shoes ever.
"I am currently healing up a plantar fasciitis and swollen ankle.  Incredibly, I was able to wear these shoes brand new out of the box for 14 hours comfortably.  This is the only pair of closed toe shoes that I have ever been able to wear this long with no break in period.  I have custom made insoles on order through my podiatrist.  I plan to continue wearing these shoes as delivered and extend the life of the new inserts by using with other walking shoes that are not as well made.  I am very impressed with the Drew shoe and have already told friends and relatives who want a really comfortable walking shoe to try Drew.  No wonder it comes in so many colors!  If I didn't already have another brand on order in black I would be buying a second pair immediately."
They run super small! I'm normally a size 8 in shoes and either an 8.5/9 in boots! I had to order the size 10 in these (as a 9.5 wasn't an option) the size 9 was way to tight. Size 10 fits perfectly with thick socks!
"The reason I gave this 4 stars is because the title could be misleading for some. They are NOT jeans. They are navy blue sweat pants that are sewn together with gold/yellow stitching to appear like jeans. There is no hint of denim whatsoever. WITH THAT BEING SAID ... They are perfect for me because I'm all about comfort. For the past 20++ years of dressing up to go to work every single day I've reached a point in my life where I just want to be comfortable and these pants are exactly what I need. They look super cute with a Tee or Tank Top and sneakers or Flip Flops. I also own 2 pair of Pajama Jeans but I wanted to try these because of the price. The difference :
Pajama Jeans are more expensive. They are made of a thicker material, heavier and do have a more denim jean appearance including detail on the pockets (rivets) . Also they are a tad bit shorter in length. The length of both of these pants (Comfy and Pajama Jeans) are so great because I don't have to have them hemmed. I'm not sure how the length would be on you if you're over 5'5.  I'm 5'4 about 150lbs and I wear a medium in these comfy jeans and they fit perfect with a little room. I do NOT put them in the dryer. I line dry because I don't want the length to shrink.  I own both Large and Medium in the Pajama Jeans (I wear the large ones around the house). In all honesty The Comfy Jeans Pajama Style pants are my favorite. They are more light weight ( I'm a hot natured person ) They fit better and feel better. I wear them everywhere. I'm done with expensive uncomfy regular jeans that are too long , too short, show crack, stretch out after an hour of wearing them , dig in , ride up etc etc !!! I used to joke about these pajama type pants until I got a pair. LOL I'm never going back.

*** UPDATE ***  After several washes they started to get fuzzy with little beads on them so now I can only wear them around the house : (  I only wash them with jeans so I wasn't expecting that to happen. I'm very careful in washing all my clothes. I line dry as well.  Oh well.  The Pajama Jean brand doesn't do that. They are still going strong after everyday wear and weekly washing. So the real PAJAMA JEANS are the winner !!!"
This suit is nothing short of amazing.  Make sure you know your suit size before ordering and the suit runs long because it is meant to be tailored to match your height for a personalized fit.
"I really do love these gloves. I actually put alot wear into the gloves and they are still going strong. They primary use for these are at ren fairs for me. Wearing them for hours, eating with them on, drinking, being jolly, minor mock fighting. No seriously I have ate turkey legs to watermelon in these gloves, they fit wonderfully, the large cuff goes really well with any outfit. I wore a ring over these gloves, it did not harm them at all, if these ever wore out I would re buy another pair. I added a picture from one of the ren fairs(Michigan Ren Fair). These are a bit expensive, but totally worth the price. Real leather, they age beautifully. No peeling or cracking."
Came a little bent and I cut the eye holes to be bigger. When it comes to Halloween you should expect to milder costume... So I give it 5 stars anyway.
Fit really nice...some stretch for comfort
"Fit well and don't roll down. These are worth the money. Can't say anything more, they are fine fitting undies."
"Really cool travel backpack. It will work great in our SUV or flying for a back up in case we need it for groceries, shopping or a walk around town. The blue color is really nice. It zips easily and adjusts to your shoulders. It looks like it will fit an average size adult rather than child. My 4 year old tried it on and it was huge on him. I like the two pockets for water bottles on each side. That's a big plus! Overall I'm very impressed by the quality of this travel bag."
Used the to hold the Batman Cupcake rings in when disguised as Batman for kids Halloween party at my granddaughters school.
"I like this to wear under tight tops to hide some muffin top. It usually stays down, but I have to pull down from time to time. I do not recommend for all day wear, or sitting for too long, but it helps smooth things out."
"I read that they run small so i got a large. I tend to be on the small size but i like my shirts a little loose, so i get med usually. But the large fist perfect."
this is wonderful
I have to agree with other positive posts. This IS a heavy and impressive ring. I absolutely love it.
"Other than the fact that the armpit area was a little big, I really like this shirt. I'm in the process of exchanging the shirt (3x) for a smaller size ( 2X). Therefore, I'd suggest going down on size when ordering."
The stars say it all.  Excellent fit and quality.
"Pros: This boot is very nice and well made. The leather is buttery soft and looks nice with both dress up and dress down attire. The foot bed is quite comfortable and I can stand in them all day while teaching with minimal to no discomfort. My feet don't get overheated or sweaty in these boots compared to pleather varieties. I enjoy having dry socks at the end of the day.

Cons: The boot runs small and narrow. I have narrow feet and the boot feels tight on them. I also had trouble zipping the shaft over my 15 inch calf at first. There is an expansion area, but the design would have benefited from a 1-2 inch deeper v to allow the shaft to expand properly around the leg.

The boots have stretched out a little over several days of wear. I am hoping they will continue to mold to my feet. They feel more comfortable each day I wear them, but the seem to require a long breaking in period.

Overall: Depending on how the boot adapts to my feet and calves over time, I would consider purchasing this boot again. I am extremely happy with the comfort. It is difficult for me to find shoes that allow me to stand for long periods."
It's hilarious and fits great made of good quality and I love it! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
"Pretty femine  lace panty. Made of a comfortable stretch fabric. Subtle crotchless bottom, not a large gaping hole. Thong style.

Would recommend!"
Light weight and perfect fit. Super comfortable.
"Gerber, to me, has always run a size smaller, and knowing that, I just buy a size up. These pajamas are adorable on my son. The blue and green are very vibrant. Love them."
I usually wear a size 9 and it fit very well...It is comfortable and and it was exactly what I expected
ok a bit big and gaudy
"These boots look great and are VERY comfortable (after a short break-in period) for all day wear! The lining makes these very warm to wear on a hot day, so not the best for warm weather, should be great for the Fall and Winter."
These are my favorite and such a good deal at only $43. Good for about 500 miles.
This hat is adorable!!! Superb quality and is actually cuter in person. My baby loves wearing this hat. Plus the best feature is you can fold it from the front. But a lil pricey!! It runs a size small...my daughter is seven months old and I orderd a 18 months one and it fits her well with some room to grow in it. Super cute just a lil pricey. But still love it!! :)
"Nice looking shirt, but fits somewhat small for the purchased sized."
"Not only does my daughter get compliments on this dress, but she really loves it as well. The picture reflects a good match for the color of the dress. Sure after two washes the grosgrain ribbon is fraying little but that's to be expected. Just grab some no fray from a craft store and it won't be a problem.  The lace on the top has held together really well after four or five times of washing which I was really pleased with. My preschooler has very sensitive skin, and it is very soft on the inside.  She hasn't had any issues wearing it. I ordered a 5 and she is a little over 4 1/2 (shes about average excepting bring just barely taller than most girls her age). I'd absolutely buy this again."
"I love, love, love, this wallet. I have the matching bag too. I already received compliments on both! No complaints here."
Fit my 9 year old son perfectly - we had to add extra holes in the straps because it was too long. The size of the bag itself fit my 9 year old son perfectly. He has used it as a book bag and as an everyday satchel (even Indiana Jones wears one). It will fit a Kindle Fire 8 inch (with room) as well as a Microsoft surface 2 (very snug).
GREAT GREAT SHIRT
Very pretty jewelry for the price.  I wear it often to the office.
Love love love it! So many compliments goes with a lot. Comfy. And pretty
Great Led shirt.  Love it!
I would rate it 5 if it hold its form better. The strap is large so I will have to alter it. Hoping it will hold up. I will update if it doesn't.
"I love my cupcake knee high women's knee socks!  My friends at work were admiring them and I think I will be purchasing more to give as gifts.  These socks are very warm, the colors are as seen in the picture,  and there are no threads sticking out in the insides to deal with.  I highly recommend these socks!"
"i love this pair of shoes,and wear them walk on the road attract the attention of people ! so great !!!"
The suit itself it well made but definetly order a size or 2 up! But the suit itself is really nice!
"Very, very cute."
I really like these pants.  They are comfortable and the ideal weight  to pull on and head for the beach or any casual fun!
"Had ordered two previous pairs of Skechers sneakers and they felt like walking on a cloud. Ordered one size larger for the boots but they were still a bit tight. Look good, but not as comfortable as hoped."
"This locket makes a nice gift for anyone who has someone to remember. Just lift out the plastic insert, add a picture (or two , it's double sided), replace the plasticcover, and it is done."
My son loves them - nice looking and fit well and light weight.
I absolutely love this ring! It's very comfortable and fits true to size. It's very unique as well. I'm sure I will get lots of compliments on it. Was also shipped fast. Anyone that loves cameo will love this ring!
"love these...super comfortable, and gf thinks they look hot, what more could you ask for!
  have a 31/32 waist and ordered large, fit perfectly"
"I love these pants! In fact, my boss almost had me buy her a pair because she kept commenting on how cute they were. :) They fit nicely and stay up; no sagging! And there is no zipper so you don't have to worry about that coming down. They are very comfortable and not cheap-feeling. I will have to buy some more in other colors."
"I absolutely love the pendant. It is very beautiful and just the right size. I don't use the chain because I put the pendant on another chain that I have worn for years. Having a three year old and a nine month old, I don't think the original chain would have lasted very long with every day wear. So I don't know how well that is made or how well it is."
"Ordered a large.  Fit perfect.  The shirt is not squared off at the bottom hem line.  It's got the ""un-tuck-it"" kind of shirt tail.  Not wild about that in a Hawaiian shirt but the wife liked it so will keep it but won't buy another of that brand."
Great looking belt and i love the white option.
If one is familar with Cigar Humidors this item is very similar. The exterior is very nicely finished. The hinges and closure are perfect. Inside the padding and display make a nice fit. What I particularly enjoy is as an owner of multiple Citizen Eco-Drive watches (solar Charged) I can place the entire display case by a window or source of natural light and charge all the batteries at once. For my needs I couldn't be happier
Can't dress as Shrek for halloween without these
"Great Shoe! Built well, comfortable"
Tight at the top but very flowy over the stomach and lower parts.
teenager loved this t-shirt
If you have larger calves these are perfect. Don't need to order a size up. I had to order two sizes up from the regular and decided to get these. So comfortable and sexy
"LOVE, Thank you!"
another great pair of levis.....arrived quickly and fit great
"Perfect sweater, alot thicker than i expected, and relaly good fit and cut"
I'd been watching these pumps for about a year and when they went on sale ($70) I purchased them. Other reviewers said how comfortable they were and they are right. I stood/walked an entire day in them without difficulty. I am a standard size 9 and purchased same. I'm very happy with these shoes.
So far so good haven't wore them much yet
"HI
IT WAS ON TIME.
MY OLDER SON LOVED IT SO MUCH.
HE ALREADY WEAR IT IT FITS FINE AND WHEN IT COME BY WASHING NO PROBLEM WITH IT. IT STAY THE SAME.

WILL BY AGAIN"
I do love these because of the height and they are great looking too.
This skirt is awesome! The fabric is nice and thick so it isn't see through and has good form. Great quality stitching and construction.
"i love these they fit perfect i should have bought more they rock and they were very inexspensive i bought them after my 300$ glasses got stolen and i like these just as much as i liked those ,they actually fit better:)"
"Really nice wallet, exellent quality"
"As an H cup, I ordered these to have something light to wear at night that I could insert nursing pads into to prevent leaking. They do the job great! Not very supportive, but I like that it feels as though you're wearing nothing."
love these! second pair
"This slip fits a bit loose, but I prefer that.  Nice fabric, great price !"
Beautiful costume. Grandcutie loves it. Could not be happier with product or seller.
"Excellent item. Fit as expected, very comfortable. Good quality."
I wish they had more ventilation  They get a little hot after a couple hours.  Sox or no sox
I have always liked crocs but wasn't a big fan of their styles.  This shoe looks like a normal sandal but feels like a croc.
All stars for comfort and likability for fit.  However...the footbed is peeling off the outer layer from the edges within 1 day of wear!! Not happy about that! So seller & or manufactuerer needs to re-engineer the wear and tear of the footbed coating and its peeling in spots where my feet aren't even touching it.  Possibly stored in a place with extreme temps???
These are very comfy and stay in place. I received the gray/black and white set and they are nice. Just placed a second order.
it is so wonderfull to have a bracelet that fits my 6 inch wrist. it is beautiful and the bling factor is just right stones are not too big to believe and everyone thinks it is real
I had two pair of these earrings. I sent one back because the posts were sort of like a screw back with metal holders so you had to almost screw them in. When you pulled them off the ball came off its post so I kept the one pair that was more secure and sent the broken ones back. Well I kept going back to look at them on Amazon because I really liked the one pair I had so I went for it again because of the sale price and ordered two more pairs. They have new plastic or rubber backings - like little diaphragms - that you puncture the post through so no more screwing. I love these earrrings. I have kept one in my upper ear for almost six months with no problem. Now I have two more pair. Very happy with the purchase - especially the price. If Amazon still has them snatch them up fast! Very pretty and sparkly
"Nice fabric, but they run big."
"this is my ""go to"" sweater. looks good over almost anything."
"Love, Love, Love these boots!  This West Blvd brand of boots is fabulous for me.  The fit is perfect and they actually DO come over my knees to my thighs!  I wear a boot size 10 and have long legs. These are perfect.

Kudos to this manufacturer.  Style and fit are wonderful!  Glad I made this purchase  will return to buy more."
Very nice she loved them
"These ear rings are of good quality, and great studs when you just want something small that won't stand out.  I can put them in and forget them.  I can sleep comfortable wearing these small studs.  I would have given them a 5 if they were a little larger, but as advertised they are ""Post Studs Tiny Mini"""
Dont tell anyone they aren't real because they sure look it! I really love my new hoops. The quality is amazing and I wud definitely buy other styles from this line.
Breathtakingly lovely.  Don't know how they did it with the price.  I have sewn for many years.  The fabric and quality of the finished goods were amazing..  It was as gift for someone who loves Asian dcor and accessories.  This was perfect.  You will not be disappointed.
Nice soft feel. Look great.
"Great, just as ordered."
This outfit was great and I did love how it looked however it was a tad bit big for my little girl. I don't mind though because she can wear it more then one year. I ordered a size 6x and ususally that size does fit but this was a little large. This outfit is very cute and I love Rare Editions so I would recommend any of their products
Its very good qulity and it was easy to fine my suitcase
These are great lititle utility bags at an excellent price. My kids use them for all kinds of stuff. I bought a few in a couple of colors and will probably be back for more. They ended up even being our trick or treat bags this year.
"Love these! Only wire them once so I'm not sure about long wear, but I loved them and they fit great!"
"Got these shoes for my 75 year old Dad and he can't say enough good things about it.

They are very comfortable and modern... updated his look!!"
"Fabulous ""ugly"" Christmas sweater. I wore it all last holiday season, and plan to next season. Cozy warm and ugly-cute."
"Durable, great quality, lots of pockets, and pretty color! Perfect gym bag for me!"
Nice work cover shoe.  I use them for stripping and waxing floors.  Saves me from buying new work shoes.  I can wear any kind of shoe now that I am comfortable with and these protect.
Just as I expected very comfortable wear them everywhere !
"I love these scrubs!  They might just be the most comfortable clothes I have ever worn.  The stretchy fabric is very soft and comfortable.  They are well made and have a cute design to them as well.  I normally wear a 2XL top due to my large bust size (38H) but got the XL since the reviews said they fit big.  The top is just slightly tight in the bust with extreme movement, but with everyday working their is no problem, so I'm glad I got one size smaller than I normally would.  There is TONS of room for my growing belly and everywhere else.

The only thing I would change about this scrub top is the pockets.  They are not the same on both sides.  The right side has the standard small and large square pockets.  On the left is one large angled pocket.  It's not bad, just not what I'm used to.

I am so happy I bought these scrubs (I got the matching scrub pants and equally love them)!  I would recommend them to anyone that needs them."
"Simply the most comfortable, supportive and long lasting. All day comfort and the lift and contour is excellent. For several years now and many more to come this brand and style number has been and will be my only choice."
"Fanmis Womens Watch with a Rose Gold Case and Brown Leather Strap Watch is a stunner. I love rose gold, and the white face with the handsome brown leather strap sets it off wonderfully. The quality is excellent: the watch was running when it arrived. I immediately tried it on. The  watch face has black roman numerals. However the hour hand, minute hand and second hand are blue, which looks great with the faux sapphire cabochon on the side, where you set the watch.
It is a very retro looking watch, which is highly fashionable at the moment. I don't see this fashion going away any time soon, and in the fall this watch will look smashing with all your new outfits! I think Fammis has a real hit here with this lovely ladies watch. What a wonderful gift, as well, for your friends! Gorgeous watch!

I received this watch in return for my honest, unbiased review, but the opinions are wholly my own."
"This dress is beautiful and well made however the fit could be better . My figure is small on top and bigger in the bottom. I normally wear a size 8/10.
So in order to get the dress to fit I had to order a 14 for my big bottom to fit however, once on it was too big on top. Had to return cause although the dress is beautiful the fit didn't compliment my body."
"A nylon like stretchy fabric, but in a looser cut. Very cute and flattering to my daughter who is extremely busty. Flatters fuller figures. Has held up well to washing. Design shows no wear. (Wash on cold/hang to dry) Looks good with either jeans or skirts."
Comfy warm booties!
Very comfortable. Recommend wear black panty underneath.
Love this little bracelet! It's very nice quality & I have a large wrist but it fit nicely.
"Beautiful earrings, one of the clasps were very loose but otherwise stunning for the price."
"Fit is great, sizing is accurate and they have Wides!  They are super comfy too, all cushy on the bottom with the great fit make these the best!  I also got them at a great price!"
"Love those dresses, great buy,  have about 7 of them,  checked out  the fit  and buy them accordingly"
Wore them on a recent vacation and very comfortable.
"I could not be happier with this purchase. I have wanted am Andrew Luck jersey for a long time now and this jersey is perfect. I'm 5'3"" and weight about 115 pounds and it fits perfect. Not tight, not super baggy. Not too long, not too short. The quality is excellent. The colors are vibrant. The seller shipped the jersey super fast. I got it within two days. Nicely packaged. I am incredibly happy with this transaction and I hope to buy more jerseys from this seller in the future."
Very very very nice and high quality socks!! My son loves them. My son is 20. He said they are great with his dress clothes and with jeans. Nice and versatile.
I love these shoes. Comfortable while jogging and at the gym. My husband wants some too.
"I was going to make my own mantilla-style veil but after seeing this price, I was sold. Got it quicker than expected. For the price, can't complain. Length is perfect for me (I'm 5'5""). I wasn't expecting a comb, but it came with one already sewn on."
"Im in love with this shoes. They are very soft, comfortable, perfect made, the leather is a  great quality. So Im very happy. Shipping was so fast even when it was shipped from Alabama. I used to wear Clarks for 10 years, never regret! "
Very surprised at how soft this bra feels on the inside. I didn't realize it was a full coverage bra so it fits the girls like a glove. It doesn't look like full coverage in the photo. There's no pushup on the girls. The settle nicely in the cups. I usually don't wear bras like this but it very comfortable. I can get use to the shape it gives me.
"i got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. she wears it constantly. the ring looks huge on her hand, but it looks great. the diamonds cant be seen unless you are looking close, but meh"
"I wear this rashguard when doing water fitness class.
I bought a couple of sizes bigger and am thankful for that as it fits snug.
Its so easy to unzip afterwards instead of fighting with a rashguard going over your head.
I love it!"
Two of my favorite things are hearts and angels. I love this. Size and chain length are just right. Perfect.
Nice. Just a bit too high of a heel.
"Greatest invention ever for hiding that belt bulge under tees. I was constantly pulling up my jeans if I didn't wear a belt, and if I did so my pants didn't sag, I had a huge bump in front. This solved the problem. Perfect invention."
NB is one of my favorites because of the extra wide size. They are comfortable for walking at the mall and everyday activity for a senior citizen.
I never worry about Propets and how they fit or how they look.  I wear them out.
This hat keeps my head so warm and it is adorable. I usually hate beanies but I love the look of these.
"I LOVE this little dainty, sweet ring!!! I saw it and had to have it. I bought it in a size 4 for my pinky finger to wear on my right hand, but I could have probably gotten away with wearing a size three! I am 44 years old and have extremely slim fingers. The silver is very durable and I have had no issues with the ring bending with the warmth of my hand, for I never take this ring off. The ring is very solid as far as the band is concerned even though it is constructed of two pieces of (sturdy) silver wire loops. I have had no tarnishing issues either. The little pink crystals are very bright, and the center ""diamond"" like crystal really sparkle considering how tiny they are in size. I believe it would make a lovely first ""big girl's"" ring to give to a young girl as a birthday or first communion gift...I have received many compliments on it already, as to how pretty it is and it is very reasonably priced. I am going buy two more as Christmas gifts for my two little nieces ages 6 and 5 so they can match their Auntie & have something special to bond us together."
Super gift. My 80 yr old mom loves it. She prefers it over her more expensive watches because the dial is easy to see and its stylish.
"Fun jacket, fits well. My son loves the idea of the face and he wanted to wear it right away."
Love it pretty and decorative
Very good quality.  I ordered for my son and he loves it.
"Very cute top! I read the other review which says that it buckles out at the armpit area and thought that I could just take it in myself. Upon arrival, I noticed there were two strings in the back that needed to be crossed and inserted into the sides of the armpit area. Once I did this and tightened it, it no longer buckled.

I am usually a size extra small with a D cup, so this was a bit loose on me. That is why I said it fits ""as expected"". That being said, if you have a small frame, it will be a little loose on you. As well, if you have a small bust, it may be too big.

The lace is adorable and my only complaint for this product is in the middle of the chest. It looks like they cut part of the lace.. You can look at the picture and see this. It's pretty unnoticeable though.

I will be bringing this in just a tad in order to fit my small frame. But other than that, I'm excited to wear this on my vacation next month!"
I've had other stretchers that had wooden shoe pieces but some internal parts were plastic and in time they broke. This one has all metal internal parts and the wood is beautifully finished. Also it works very well. I haven't had it long enough to see how it holds up but it seems very sturdy. The handle is easy to turn. Would definitely recommend.
"Really nice dress, color was the same as the picture and the cut was to be expected as well. The fabric was thick and a great quality, especially for the price, very pleased with the quality of the dress itself. Great dress for a fall/winter event...in this case a wedding. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of a few things:
1. Heavy fabric is great,  but it causes the skirt to pull the waistline down constantly (supposed to be empire waist) I had to keep pulling it up all day, could be fixed with a nice belt but I didn't have time to get one for this occasion.
2. The top is cut VERY low. I had to keep the girls from spilling out, two-sided tape or a cute cami underneath would have fixed this but again, didn't have time to shop for those items this time.
3. It made me look pregnant. This dress would be AMAZING as a maternity dress, if your bigger around the waistline like me, it will make that stand out, especially from a side view. It actually will make you look bigger in the midsection than you actually are unfortunately.
4. The sizing is a bit large,  I bought an XL, I'm 5'6 about 210 pounds and I liked it being lose, but could have worn a large comfortably.
Other than that, I wore the dress all day, with wedge shoes and with flats and I was pleased with the length, I got lots of compliments.  Overall, really great dress for under  $50"
My husband did add Dr Scholls insoles for a perfect fit.  These shoes look great.  He wore them all day the first day he got them.  They are very comfortable.
"Its very good quality.
Its seem very nice.
Its quite big for my size, but I keep it because is really nice. I am eating it now :)"
"Nice watch for the money, great quality as expected from Seiko, Additional watch band links don't come with it and will have to be ordered directly from Seiko."
"These are very cute and comfortable.  Color is as depicted and the shoes fit as expected.  The straps are pretty soft and comfortable.  The sole is not too flexible and quite thin, but the shoes will be comfortable enough for a day at work/school or running errands.  Might not be the best choice of shoe for spending longer periods of time in the garden or on the beach, but they are perfect for all other occasions."
"Good size and quality. I had a smaller one that I bought at a fair but I gave it to my mom so she could carry her phone and small wallet while at work. This replacement was of same quality but a bit bigger with more pockets for me to a put phone, small wallet, lipstick and keys."
"I bought these as a gift for my DIL that loves raccoons, and she loves them.  I have several pair of ""Sock It To Me"" knee high socks, and I love them all.  Nice quality, many quirky or normal choices, and super cute!"
I'm satisfied with the make and material of the product. Fits just like it should. Granted it's not mind blowing or a real game changer but for cost and quality I'd buy again if I ever need another hoodie.
Looks good...still need to wear and see the wear over time.
"A beautiful bracelet with the perfect saying, for almost anybody. Purchased off amazon review trader and a very low discounted price. Arrived on time as promised, packed perfectly. I took it out of package and put it on immediately. I absolutely love it, and so won't you!!"
I was so skeptical but this hat is well made. It does exactly what it says it does. Other slouchy hats come so mall that they don't even look like a slouchy hat when you wear it. This one does!!
It is a great workpant. Comfortable and durable
Small fit me perfectly I'm a 32 A And it looked great! Love it!
I bought a size larger like I do with all boots. The first time I wore them with sox they felt a little snug in toe area. Next time i wore them no sox they were a tad to roomy thiner sox perfect fit. They kept my feet warm although after 2 hrs in very cold temps (18) my toes were starting to go numb. I would by them again
Love these boots. Comfortalble and light. So far so good with the waterproofing
Adorable - and well made.  We love See Kai Run and these shoes are no exception!
Absolutely loved this dress for work! Super flattering and comfortable  Also true to size.  I usually work between 10-12 US in dresses so I ordered a large and it fit like a glove totally recommend it and will be buying more.
Killed it at an ugly sweater party.
"Got these for my husband, he is not a sunglasses fan, He loves these."
"Pleased with this sweater, but the weave is very loose and can snag easily.  I must be wary when putting it on that my fingers don't snag on the interior of the sweater."
Gorgeous lace. Fits perfectly. I got the black and the ivory color.  Won't disappoint!
Slim!
"I love this shirt. It is not black though. It is a silver/gray/blue. In any case, it's flattering fits great and I get lots of compliments."
I love this outfit but it runs little small so buy a size up. Cute ruffles and overall a good outfit.
"My daughter loves her new backpack. She is 9 years old and this fit her well. She likes how the lunch bag can attach to the backpack in the front, if you want it to. I added a picture of how it looks attached to the front. The size of the backpack can fit her books and notebooks just fine.

Pros:
Full Size, not toddler size, so it will last longer.
The lunch bag can attach to the front of the bag, no more smashed sandwiches.
Cute bag, it's the lion guard! The ones in the store, did not have pink or girl lion guard ones.

Cons:
This will not last through many years of heavy wear, but what kid wants their character ones that long?"
Comfortable and flattering fit!
These are super cute! I read some comments about how snug they are around some peoples legs and I can totally see it. Mine are just big enought to get around my legs and I just measured my calf and it's 40cm( just under 16inches). I already walked through a shallow pond with them and my feet stayed dry!
I love this dress so much it is beyond cute!!
It's very nice to dress up with. When I sit the buckle tends to poke me in the stomach a lot and I'm not a big girl. 122lb 5'7. Annoying but I can deal. I don't use this belt for everyday wear
but it was a mens watch so i returned it
"I bought these shoes because 1. I am from the beach culture, 2.  I needed something more professional-looking to wear at work instead of my really comfortable Reefs slip ons.  These Sanuks are very light and is totally an acceptable shoe replacement for the more expensive boat shoes like Sperrys.  I bought this during Cyber Monday along with a pair of Reefs and they both arrived earlier than promised.  The picture does not include laces but I wear the laces for work purposes.  All in all, I'm happy with this find!  Thanks!"
Great dress socks for wearing with dress-up shoes.
Fits well very soft and cozy. They were stiff at first but have  broken in after only a few wears.
A lot nicer than I thought
"This has quickly become one of my favorite summer blouses. Looks great with jeans, fit was perfect."
Looks nice. Adjustable waist ban is very nice. Happy young man. :)
These are great - they fit true to size and are quality sandals that seem like they will last a very long time. My husband is really happy with these!
"I love backpack/handbags and have used them for years.  Needed a new one and after checking many on Amazon decided on this.  It is just the right size, not too big, and has nice separate compartments.  I particularly like the two side pockets...one holds my glasses and the other my cell phone....both items I had always had to rummage thru previous backpacks to grab!  The leather is very soft.  So many comments complain about leather smells and I left this one out of the plastic packaging for a few days and it is fine. I would recommend this highly."
My wife loves these boots because she works outside in this brutal cold we're getting this year and they keep her feet warm all day.
Arrived in a few days.  Great price. Comfortable pants!
"I love it! Well made, heavier than I expected for the price. I am ordering another for my friend."
Light weight and perfect for our summer vacation.
This is the most beautiful jumpsuit . I am small petite woman and this jumpsuit fits perfect. I love buying from this seller 2luv. Their sizes are perfect. I love you 2luv. I am very happy with my order. Ladies 2luv is the real deal. Buy from this seller and you never have to return your item.
"Love this top it covers my bust (38G) and has a springy clinging form fit with some support, still need a sports bra fo Werq dancing class,  but a great material and the ruching is good cammoflauge.  its a bit long for me even at 5'8""  but some prefer that.  The material is a quality heavier blend cotton spandex type, holds you in while letting you breath. Its  stilll a bit pricey for me but worth the fit and real workout style we will se how it holds up."
Used this shorts on a vacation last week.  Loved the way they fit.  The cuff at the bottom of the shorts make them less casual and they can be dressed up with a nice top.  Will buy these again
These scrubs were a little large on me so I returned them.
I like these shorts they are light and comfy. I got them as a lightning deal and I'm not disappointed
Thanks to another review.  I knew that the wide toe box makes them itiially feel too wide.  Give the a couple days.
"These are great shoes and I especially like walking down the stair in them as you can see where your foot is landing on the step.  Every time I wear them, I get positive comments."
"Boots fit great. Just has the leather sides on the inside, no lining like my other danners. Soles are really comfortable for walking around and standing. Never been disappointed yet with any danner boots I've owned.  And cheaper than any other place I could find them by quite a bit."
I loved the pants!!! Really wish it would've fit me right!!!  Ordered the X-small and it was still too big!!! 
Fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for! My husband's favorite style for his construction job.
These socks are adorable! They did shrink a bit in the wash but they stretch back pretty well once you put them on and they are comfortable. The fabric is nice and I love the cat pattern!
It's not that bad. Get exactly what you see.
"Heavier than I expected, but great for Spring/Fall.  Sleeves are a bit long."
"very nice material, however sizing runs quite large.  I ordered the size I take in clothing, but it is too big.  Next time will order size smaller.  I washed it in very warm water and machine dried to try and shrink it, but it did not shrink.  It is lovely material, just consider orderi g a size smaller than the chart indicates."
OK product and a good price
These Vera bags have all the right pockets (without having too many pockets).
"Shoes are nice fits well,but the ankel strap is way too short,an my ankels are small  couldn't fasten them at all so i will return them. Well made an look nice such a disapointment. Price was also good"
Fits perfectly.  Nice length.
Authentic! Amazing! Half the price of department stores!! I'm obsessed!! Love it!
"They were too narrow for me, gave them to a friend, she loves them. Says they are VERY comfortable."
I bought this item in Tan.  It looks and feels way better than I could've imagined
"Pretty!  Make sure you get tank tops for underneath, though!"
"I love the pattern, and the construction is great.  The fit, however, was shocking.  The 2XL shirts are more like 3XL!!  I can get a good 6-8"" of overlap when I wrap the shirt around my torso after putting it.  If I get more shirts from Johari, I will get the size smaller.  Beyond that, great shirts!"
These were a huge hit at our bachelorette party!  Hard to see out of though.
excellent organization for travel
Really cool tie!  Works great!
"My daughter loves them, the color is as shown and they are comfortable to her (she has a wide foot)."
"My husband who works on roof tops some times in the cold for HVAC, loves the jacket.  He says it's too nice to wear to work!"
"Cute shoes and my daughter loved wearing them. They didn't hurt her feet and the material feels a lot like crocs. She can wear them in and out of water too. They do tend to make her feet a bit smelly though if she wears them for awhile, which the crocs do not do. I think its the material the sole is made of, it seems to be some sort of a memory foam insert. Unlike other skechers, these ones don't seem to give at all or stretch. My daughter grew out of these super fast."
"I love these boots. They fit great, look great and are very comfy:) I use them for working in the chicken pen and garden."
"I am a 7.5 to 8 wide foot, hard to fit with high arches.  I was concerned with the reviews for putting this boot on since it does not have a zipper.  It is a little challenge but really not difficult.  And once it is on, heavenly.  I have never had a boot or a shoe feel as good as this. Absolutely no breakin. Very cute, love it, and getting many compliments!"
"I grew tired of having to replace my cheaper fabric and synthetic sandals every few months. So i decided to spend a bit more on something that would hopefully last longer. In succession, ordered 2 pairs of Birkenstocks and 1i pair of Tevas. None fit my 9.5 - 10 US sized, slightly-wide foot. They were all too small. Finally i ordered these Muk Luks - and i found what i'd been looking for. I work at home - and wear these all day long. And after over a month of use, i don't see any deterioration of the materials. I'm knocking off 1 star because i wish they had a bit more arch support. There is some - but just not enough for my taste. Still, solidly recommended."
"She's happy with them. They fit well, I really can't give it 5 stars because she's only worn them once."
worked great just didn't have the color  i wanted
"I have bought two of these so far and they are wonderful. They are soft and fit well. My biggest problem with them (as most pants go) they are way to long on me. I am 5'1"" and they are about 6""-8"" too long. I have to hem them. I wish they came in a short length - then they would be perfect."
Good quality long lasting hat
These fit just fine and are comfortable with no problems with wrinkles or waistband.
"I'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. I got the size 4-10. These fit me skintight, but that's the way I like my clothes in general. There's no bunching in awkward places. It also doesn't ride up over time, which is a common issue I've had with snug dresses."
"I like these shirts.  I just purchased 3 of them and they are great.  I wish they were wrinkle free but if you put them in the dryer on a medium heat for about 5 minutes it will take most out.  I love the pockets and a place to stash little things.  Word of warning however, these run large in my opinion.  I really think I could have used a medium whereas I wear mainly large in most shirts.

So it you want a lightweight and UV protection shirt in great bright colors then this would be a great pick for you.  These also wear well tucked in if you wish.  Forgot to mention the collars are velcro so you don't have that small hard to manipulate button like most shirts that have button down collars.

Great buy and price!"
"We used the Amazon size guide with picture to print, measure and determine the size. The shoes arrived exactly as described and they are super comfortable. After two weeks my 12-month old son even tries to get into them by himself (not successfully yet). They go with every item of clothing he has and I like that it has a line inside that indicates when it is time to get the new pair of shoes - we are not there yet though :) I am definitely ordering the same shoes in bigger size once we grow out of these ones. They are easy to put on and remove and they do stay on no matter what he does. He also walked in puddles in them and they stayed dry on the inside."
Life saver!!! Now I don't have to deal with leaking and holding the bottles while pumping. Fits well
I bought these for my youngest son.  HE LOVED THEM and that says something.
"I bought these shoes online for a last minute interview. Love them! Comfortable, with a reasonable heel height. Unlike most heels I didn't experience any discomfort or blisters, great buy."
Love this top!  Great quality for a great price!  I've gotten so many compliments on this shirt!
I got these for my wife and she loves them. She is on her feet all day at work and these shoes have solved her back pain after the first days use!
Runs a bit large. Comfy. Soft. Longer length is nice.
"I love the fit of my new NYDJ shorts.  I have been buying the jeans for years, but I'm loving the shorts too.  I just wish they came in some prints."
Love Chucks! And the color is so vibrant!
"this was my 2nd purchase, both times items were as advertised and arrived quickly. would consider again for another ring purchase, would also recommend to others. A++"
"I loved my Members Only jacket in high school, and now about 30 years later, I love this new one just as much. The fabric seems more durable and water-repellent now, but other than that, it's the exact same classic jacket. Looks great. Perfect for Fall weather. Highly recommend."
"This coat was an excellent choice. The color is exactly how I wanted it, it's very nice and can be worn in a professional setting. The pockets are really soft! In addition, Amazon's 70% off promo saved me $200!"
They're incredible. I love them
Gift for Grandson.  He loves them and wears them all the time.
"Having chemo and pretty all over hair loss, this is truly an awesome cap.  Fits kind of loose (a great asset - no headache after a couple of hours of wear).  It's really attractive and works well for dressy outings."
They fit great but take a little while to break in!
It's a true fit medium for me with respect to the circumference of the jacket.  A little snug in the arms due to the heavy weight of the liner and insulation.  All in all a very nice and warm jacket.  Not a lightweight jacket.
"Wore these super comfortable scrubs all throughout my pregnancy. Great quality, did not fade, and so soft. Well worth the money!"
Beautiful and figure flattering swimsuit.
Very comfortable and fits larger
"This is a very elegant box for any ring you are planning to give a loved one, the wood looks great and is very shiny.  The white leather inside is very nice as well.  It looks like it costs way more than it does.  Its big too which adds to the effect more, it is a great box to keep a ring in and whoever you give it to as a gift will love it as well and proudly show it off on there dresser because it is very classy.  I bought it as a gift and that is my opinion.  If you are looking to buy it for yourself to keep a ring it is worth it as well.  I plan on buying one for every nice ring that I give loved ones, I definitely found a winner here, its well worth the price you won't be disappointed."
"These shoes are very comfortable.  I've worn them hiking on gravel roads and hills; soon I'll be hiking on rough terrain and assume they will be just as comfortable.  Although I bought the gray because it was on sale, I love the other color choices.  This shoe brought me back to Merrell after a few years of wearing Oboz."
I think the blue of the stones was as I saw in the picture.  It's a nice ring
Nice assortment of socks for the price.
Very comfortable and probably buy another pair.
While the shirt fit Larger then expected customer service was great about it. I will definitely order this again.
Great gag gift to an alien lover
"Beautiful shows, is necesary extra wide shoes !"
This fits real nice.
"This is my third pair of Stacy Adams shoes. I've been very happy with them. They wear well, look great, and are very comfortable."
This is beautiful and perfect. My daughter did a little dance when I got this for her. Reminds me of Fruity Pebbles.
I got these for my other half. I wanted something they could go in the swimming pool or beach water with. We have been planning a vacation for months now and these arrived just in time. I would suggest ordering a half size up as they are water shoes and are meant to be a bit snug. They work great in water and do not weight you down. They let your feet breathe and not sweat as you walk around the pool or beach. Perfect for what we needed. I received a free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.
Love this dress. It's perfect! Comfortable! Will buy from this company again!
"I've had these for the better part of 2 months now, and am completely pleased with the purchase. They look good, are very well made, and the non-slip soles really do the job!

They felt a little tight across the toe at first (which was surprising as I ordered the wide size) but after a couple of days breaking in, they were completely comfortable. The best part is that while the insoles offer great arch support, they're also 100% removable, so you can put in your own insoles (Dr. Schole's, etc) if you feel so inclined, so you can get exactly the level of comfort you want/need.

After a few weeks of the damp Seattle weather, I did notice an annoying constant squeak from the heel of first my left, then both shoes.  I was incredibly dismayed, because as much as I loved these shoes, it was incredibly annoying. However, a trip to visit my in-laws in Arizona inadvertently fixed the problem/showed me how to avoid it. Being 80+ degrees and in a dry climate, I chose to wear sandals my entire trip there. When we got back home, I realized the squeak was gone! After a few days in rainy weather, I noticed the squeak gradually returning. Surmising that the reason it went away was because the dry Arizona air got rid of some moisture that worked its way inside the shoe, I took the insoles out and left my shoes next to the heating duct for the night. The next day, the squeak was gone! I've taken to lifting the heel of the insole out of the shoes at night to allow them to breathe and prevent holding moisture in, and haven't had a single issue with squeaking since.

Please note, you probably WON'T encounter this issue unless you're in an area with a lot of cool, damp weather (like Seattle). And even if you do, it's an easy fix if you encounter the squeaking issue I described. With how easy it was to remedy, I certainly didn't feel like it was enough to knock this below 5 stars. Totally satisfied with these."
Pretty scarves.  The background is a darker beige so be aware of that when you order.
Very pretty design. The size I got just comes together in front (XL) so it's a bit small.
Great for a gift! Engraved his name on the front buckle thing.
"Because of a knee injury and a foot that does not line up like it should, the right shoe has worn over the right right side so it does not give me the support I need."
These are heavier and thicker than most womens black socks for warmth but still work well with ankle boots and mule shoes.  I have a small foot and most ladies socks are too big but these stay put and wash well.
These are great.  They are really comfortable and they are very cute.  I walk dogs for a living and these are wonderful for walking and keeping my feet dry.  I don't always want a big long boot on if it isn't needed but the ground is wet and I need something to keep my feet dry.  They arrived in just a few days which was wonderful.
"I've applied this top coat to my regular nail polish and really does increase the shine and give it that glossy Gel polish look. I do think it extended my wear time by a little bit (but not by a large amount of time...maybe it works better if you use it with a Londontown Nail Polish rather than another brand).

I did really like the shine it gave to my nails (without having to go through the hassle of curing my nails with a UV light) and it was very easy to apply."
Son loved it for Halloween costume!
Shoes were for my wife. she loves them - wears them to the gym every day.
Just right for my Mom
"Surprisingly high quality, basic polo that fits very well."
Great shoe/boot.  I was impressed with how cheap these were and yet so well made.
I had to order a size higher  because of my long toes the slipper would flip off my feet. I  sewed elastic straps across the top of this slipper. I wear them more often around the house. They are comfortable and keep my feet happy.
looks good! necklaces don't get tangled.
"Very large, comfortably and pretty bag. My girlfriend will be using it for her wedding day. Said this was her favorite gift for her bachelorette party."
Very nice and elegant. Iv'e received many compliments
"I love this collection .it would be five stars if it were silk but the look and cost are what counts most to me. As a professional chauffeur wearing a solid black suit, the tie makes the look and these do the trick. I have better silk ties but these are a good value. If you are like me and someone can tell what you ate for lunch by looking at your tie these are for you. They are cheap enough to throw away and good enough to look good at the same time. Recommended"
Awesomec
"These boots ARE true to size... I'm a 7 in everything and the occasional 6.5. I was a little suspicious of the other reviews suggesting going up a full size, or a size and half up. That's quite the difference. I already own some Keen hiking shoes that are 6.5, and while they fit, they felt a little tight in the toes if I wore wool socks. I based my sizing off that and got these boots in a 7. Dude, the 7 fits perfect. If you FOR SURE know your TRUE size, get that size.

These boots are comfortable right out of the box! I immediately wore them dog walking down muddy dirt roads and trails for a couple miles and they were great. I like them a lot. They're comfortable, they fit great, and I really like the colors. Good ankle support. They seem like they're quality boots as well. American made, baby.

I have a backpacking trip coming up and will update my review after. For now, I'll keep using these dog walking and hiking the local trails to break them in.

UPDATE----

I just got back from a 28 mile backpacking trip in the Grand Gulch Primitive Area in Utah. These boots KICKED BUTT! I wore appropriate wool hiking socks with them and never had issues with my feet. I had hot spots on the outside of my big toes (both big toes) and that was it. I taped them off and was good to go the rest of the trip. Meanwhile, everyone else in my group with different boots were taping practically their entire feet.

The soles are very grippy, I was the only one in my group that wasn't struggling to get a good foot hold on the steeper parts. We also climbed some sandstone and slickrock, these boots gripped just fine. There was one point in my trip where I had to shimmy through a small hole and along the edge of a canyon wall to reach some ruins and I felt like I could trust these boots with my life, they wouldn't let me slip down the wall. Overall, I am very, very happy with these comfortable, grippy boots and will continue to buy Keens in the future."
This shoe is lovely and my daughter loves it. However it is a larger than expected fit. Good that both the ankle and top of foot straps are adjustable to compensate. Leather seems soft and no rubbing.
Love my ASICS. Been wearing them for years and this years model reminds me of the 3s. Work very for me.
"I would recommend this bra to anyone with cysts.  After wearing underwire bras for years and in pain, this bra is such a relief."
"these shoes are better than expected, nice snug fit so no heel flopping. its very true to size and would buy again"
They are snug but I needed it snug.
Very feminine yet looks good while on a bike.   it with the purple and skull.  I get many compliments. I would definetly  buy it again. Very good quality tank and fits true to size.
"bought for my son new job , keeps his feet dry he works around moving water . He stayed wet in regular boots"
"Ordered these for my husband for Christmas, first pair didn't fit so I had to reorder.(my error) My husband wears these everyday and they wear better than the more expensive ones that I bought before at the mall. I will definitely reorder these when the time comes,"
I really enjoy this watch. It looks good and has been keeping accurate time. The band originally was a bit long and it was necessary to remove a couple of links at a jewelry store. I love the fact that the sun charges it and that I won't have to worry about batteries dying when I'm on a trip.
Wife loves shirt
Decent buckle for the price.  Alignment between the two holes (threaded and clearance) can sometimes be a little off. Haven't received one that was bad enough to keep the screw from going in all the way though.
These are an improvement over the 1.0 and 1.5 versions because the traction is so much better.  Really helps on the crumbly downhills and on snowfields!
I bought them for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift and she loves them.  The shoes appear to be well made.
Bright colors and nice fit are making it easier to potty train my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. She loves the panties with owls on them. Easy for her to get off if she has an accident and easy to put on another pair to start again.
A little darker purple than I thought. Don't really catch the light and they look a little more black than expected. Good quality though.
How can you go wrong for the price?  I just wanted umbrellas but my wife wears the scarves too.
Great product when you just a little more room in the waist.
"I work in a hospital so I need shoes that are very comfortable when doing a lot of walking and standing.  These are the perfect shoe for someone who stays on their feet.  They have a nice amount of arch, are very lightweight and attractive looking.  I ordered a wide because my feet tend to border between a regular and wide size in normal shoes and New Balance shoes tend to run a little narrow for me.  It was a good decision because they fit perfectly.  I have worn them nearly every workday since they arrived and my feet or back have not felt tired at the end of the day even once."
Bought this for vacation. Fits great.
"Just tried on my new St Patty day suit and I gotta admit, I look GOOD!
Seriously though, it's a better quality suit that I expected. If it was a normal color I wouldn't be totally embarrassed to wear it to a business meeting. It does run a bit small though. I ordered a size larger than I would usually wear and it fits pretty good, but still a little small in the shoulders. Overall though, I'm very pleased."
"My high school freshman bought this for Homecoming. It is very cute. Way cuter in person than in photos. The metallic fabric is pretty. It looks really cute on her and will look even better when we get her the right strapless bra. It's super comfortable. She was a little underwhelmed by it, so we're keeping it as a backup dress in case she doesn't find anything better since it was only $10.61. I'll get more than that consigning it when we're done! She is petite and a size 3 fit her well."
I love these Vionics.  They were comfortable when I first worn them on plane.  A few days later I wore them (without socks) to do a lot of walking for most of day.  The band wore a blister on my big toe joint on one foot.  With socks this shouldn't be a problem.
"I wear the Timberland Pro Men's Titan everyday, all day and they are comfortable and great work boots."
"These are pretty cute, but run much larger than most Volatile shoes I've owned in the past. I normally wear an 8.5-9: 9 for heels/boots, 8.5 for flats/everything else, and all Volatile shoes have been 9. My left foot tends to be slightly larger than my right, yet my left heel lifts from these when I walk! I ordered the 9 for these & my feet slip around a bit- would require thick socks & they still feel like they'll break in quite a bit. I'll be returning these for sure, but might order the 8.5 instead, as they are pretty cute and seem extremely comfortable if they were a bit tighter!"
i wear between a 7.5 and 8 so i bought a 38.  i found this should slightly bigger than expected but nothing to fuss about.  i wish the solid black was available in my size.  i feel like a white-walled tire sometimes!
"These shoes have been excellent.  I have always enjoyed New Balance shoes so I was happy to try these out.  I am a runner and these shoes have been excellent.  I would have to say that they fit a bit snug but not unbearable.  The arch support is fine.  The cushion on these shoes is good.  I have not worn them during the rain so I can't speak to that.

Overall I do recommend these shoes.  New Balance makes excellent shoes and these are no different.  The colors are clear as well.  They look good on me and not too bright."
Best bag for my daughters swimming stuff. Very sturdy and great quality. Never regretted this order.
great pants! They really fit well and they look great on ....so glad I bought them!
"I am regularly a size 8 or 7.5 I Ordered size 8 on this shoes and it fits perfect! Enough room to wear thick or thin socks, i got it 3 weeks after i ordered it... The shoes looks nice all of the lights work perfectly fine, they also came in charged !!! I am a size 8 on vans so this might help you with your purchase"
Hard to find  polo  with pocket.  Prices were great.
Very nice..wish it was made from stainless steel.
Comfortable and stylish! I was mildly disappointed that the one I received didn't look quite as nice as the picture(mine has a purple bill)but it still looks really good and its clearly stated it won't look just like the picture! Fit was perfect as well.
"I've been using these for at least 15 years now.  Nice, simple, accurate watch.  They eventually wear out--get scratched, etc., but for the money, it's no hassle to replace.  I'm glad (and a little surprised) that this model has been around for so long.  Hope they keep it going.

STP"
A little pointy in the center of the hat.
These are beautiful and comfortable.  I get loads of compliments planning  to purchase the other two colors.
"I have been recently exploring this line of make up.  I have to say I am impressed.  This is a really nice shade of eye shadow.  It is perfect for a lid color, or a highlighter.  It is a nice fleshy color with a slight shimmer.  This goes on creamy and and doesn't flake off.  If you are wondering what these are comparable to I think they are like Urban Decay.  These are a high end and high quality eye shadow.

The packing is pretty, a nice multi-colored case.  It has a nice clasp and isn't going to come open.

Overall I really like this eye shadow, its great for everyday wear."
Dress was very flattering and fit perfect for the size
Fits as expected and the kids love it!!
This boots feel good! Looks good!
"Cute, soft, not to heavy."
A little narrow for a squirmy foot.
Quality is even better than my brand expensive dresses.
"""Perfect"" says my wife."
These are a very flattering style. They were smaller than another pair I got which was the same model. I still recommend them.
gorgeous leather shoes that even fit a really chubby baby!
"I've had nothing but Nike and New Balance for the last 30 years. What I've found is that one model of New Balance doesn't necessarily fit like a other. Other than that, they're great. The leather holds up, and the stitching is secure and lasts. This model at size 10 is a tad larger than the last model (600 and 623). I could have returned them but decided to keep them. If I order again, I'll order a half size down."
Great boots... Fast shipping!
"Nice nice nice swimming suit, the color is like the picture but it runs a little small, I'm 66 kilo a buy a L and by my shoulders it a little snug, but overall is a great buy"
"I obtained Obagi Foaming Gel at the same time as Obagi Nu-Dern Toner and  Serum and began to use them all at once and at the same time.  I saw incredible results after one use and this has continued since then.  My face looks years younger, cleaner and better toned.

No, this is not a paid commercial.  I am a no-nonsense New Yorker, beholding to only the truth.

The foaming gel cleanses quickly, thoroughly.  It has a pleasant aroma and you only need to use a little at a time.  The toner is not very strong.  The fact that no dirt comes off is a tribute to the foaming gel.  Other toners I have used are really astringents and feel like they have stripped your face of its natural oils.
The serum goes on easily and quickly.  I place a few drops in the cup of my hand and put it on my face.  Honestly, I don't know what it does, but my face is smoother, with no pores showing.  My makeup goes on more easily and stays on longer.

These products are not cheap, but I feel like I look five years younger, and my friends have noticed a difference.  Despite the cost, I believe I will purchase them when I have finished
I rate each of them a five."
This is a nice shirt and great design. Only issue with it is how thin the fabric is; already knicked it with my key ring of all things. Keep in mind when purchasing.
What could be better? Haflinger slippers and coffee cups together. Love the slippers.
"I like this shoe. I believe I would love this shoe if my arch was deeper. My feet are somewhat flat, so I knew there would be a chance it wouldn't quite work out, but I tried anyway because I need a great dance fitness shoe and it came with pretty good reviews.
What I like about it: It seemed to be true to size, but I think I can see how people say it's a little roomy. I wear a size 9, but I still don't think an 8.5 would have been a smart move, personally. It was comfortable for a while. The only thing that began to be uncomfortable was the arch, b/c I just chose the wrong shoe. It worked very well with my turns and transitions while dancing.
What I didn't like: It slid a little when it was time to stretch and didn't provide the ankle support I was looking for in a high top. It may have worked if I'd pulled the velcro part really tight, but that just wouldn't look right.
Overall, it was ok. Just wish I could find the same type of performance in a shoe that doesn't have a split sole, one that caters to my flat feet."
"true red color, good quality and a very nice fit."
"So far so good. Ordered this in white and black to go over sleeveless summer dresses so that they are work appropriate. I was looking for something lightweight because I don't want thick/heavy fabric in the summer. These are light, a good length, and fit as expected. I typically wear either Medium or Large tops depending on the fit, so I ordered each size for comparison. The medium fit nice and snug, and the large was a little looser, but I kept the Large in case it shrinks when washing. I'll update my review if any quality issues come up after wearing and washing these, but so far I'm satisfied, especially for the price."
"These boots are great!  Given the fact that I have never owned this brand and there aren't many reviews, I am so happy I bought these.  They are exactly what I was looking for - a comfy, almost flat, casual, biker(ish) boot.  I normally wear a size 8.5 shoe and boots I buy a size 9 because I wear thicker socks.  Ordered these in an 8.5 and they are perfect.  They seem to be made really well so I feel confident saying they will be worth every penny in years to come."
"The style is very accommodating and versatile. It is a bit on the 'formal' side with its classic shape and form, and may not be suitable for casual dress ... depending on your personal taste and preference. The fabric and quality of stitching is also well-done. My daughter is pleased and said I should rate it 5-Star ... as I have."
love them - fit great and the colors are wonderful
"Really nice shoe but I ordered 91/2 and I normally wear a 10 in his shoes, so needless to say they were a little small so will be returning. But not because I did not like the shoe. I actually reordered them in the blush and black in the size 10. I knew to start with I should have ordered the 10."
"Always buy Clarks shoes on Amazon. Great selection, made of leather, and fit to size."
Much prettier than I thought it would be in silver.  I would definitely purchase it again.
"This is my third Carhart coat. And if you are looking for warm, water resistant and rugged, go no further."
Gave a couple of these to my nieces and they seemed to really like them.
Great Fit Very Comfortable for Work!!
"Beautiful, comfortable shoes!  They are high quality at a terrific price."
Very light weight - will be perfect for warm rainy days!
great price..sturdy denim.
Cute necklace. I got many compliments.
Very nice a comfortable!
"Very pretty, well made earrings! I definitely recommend buying them!"
My teenage daughter and I like to wear matching rings and I found this one while searching for double-infinity designs and liked it. We got ours and they look great and fit well. We couldn't be happier with these rings.
"Love sketchers. And have a hard time finding them in wide,I have two pairs of this style, I like that they are a bit sturdier on the soles, they added some firmer feeling material. Sketchers always seem like the soles ware out fast, so I'm hoping the new improved soles will give a longer life to these..

I also can put orthotics in these and my feet don't slip out.
As far as sizing, I usually get a 9 without the orthotics,but with this style a 8 1/2 fit me better... To play it safe with my orthotics I bought the 9.
I can still ware these with out the orthotics but  they feel a bit loose."
Great for a switch off shoe/
I love the jacket. I got this for my son last winter. It kept him warm and looked very nice on him. One of favorite jackets I ever bought for him.  Great jacket
"Very happy with the quality and it met my expectations for my daughter. It was hard to find this size in stores. Also, something that wasn't so puffed up or padded since my daughter is still young."
"Well made. Very comfortable, If they fit just a little better, it would have been 5 stars. Very happy."
"Good, solid and stylish shoes.  Well made and fit comfortably while looking good, perfect for wearing with jeans or camo"
These are authentic clogs which I love.
Great looking shoes for the price.
"Same as before!,two chrome and a black one!,the ladies like em,the guys want em,the old story!,WORKS GREAT!!"
Great quality!  My daughter LOVES it!
"Love these shoes!  Very comfortable, the thin upper and lack of padding around the ankle make it fantastic for me.  I have had problems with my Achilles tendon and the thick padding on some shoes irritates it.  I have only one complaint, the tread is wearing out very quickly.  I wish I could find the same style upper on a more durable sole.  For the price, I would expect the tread to last much longer."
seems a little too snug a sleeve end daughter says but loves jacket
Good for running and cross-fit. I find them very comfortable.
"I like Vans, these were too small though"
"I'm a size 9 and the pair I got fit me great, even when wearing thick socks. So I guess these have a little bit of allowance. They're perfect!"
This item shipped fast & looked very nice.  It does come in its own gift box which was an additional perk to the purchase.  I bought these for a gift & the recipient said she really liked them.
"Gorgeous backpack but too small to fit my daughters 2"" binder."
"These fit well for an athletic calf- my calves are not huge but by no means ""skinny"". I'm 5""8, 135 and they hit a little above mid calf. I have a hard time finding boots that come high enough for my liking and aren't too tight, these do a good job. Not the most comfortable as far as arch support- I wouldn't want to wear them all day if I was going to be on my feet the majority of the time, but they are great for casual dress-ups. Outstanding for the price- I have Fryes and looked into a black pair, but these were just such a better choice for price and value. Nice leather boot without the sticker shock!"
"My husband has purchased two pairs and really likes them.  They are not too heavy, they fit comfortably and are perfect for the winter season."
"My baby received a few pairs of Robeez shoes from grandma, which we loved.  Problem was that they were impossible to get on squirmy little feet.  Unfortunately wearing only socks just wasn't enough on many cold days.  One day I thought ""if there was only a shoe that was just made of a cloth that was wrapped around their foot!"".  Hooray for Amazon...after a few quick searches, we found Zutano shoes.  They are so perfect for babies.  You get their socks on and then just wrap the shoe around, snap, and you're done!  Perfect.  We don't use these indoors much anymore as our baby is walking, and these are not great for that -- a bit too bulky, tend to shift around and are pretty slippery, but we still use them on walks in the stroller when it's cool enough to warrant it.  Awesome purchase!!"
My husband Loved it!
"The set is nice but the ring was kinda small, I do have large hands for a girl.  It is adjustable and looked good on."
"These are the best pants I've ever purchased. I was worried that I was overpaying, but after putting them on, I can see why they cost so much. They're durable and thick, but not bulky. They hugged my body and fit exactly as I thought they would. I'm 5'5"", 110lbs and ordered the 1. I got two colors, but ordering more right now."
"I have bought 5 of these now. They fit comfortably, I don't have to deal with sorting out exact sizing and are super easy to nurse in. I loved them while pregnant and even more post."
"I ordered the moccasins for my husband.  They were too small.  The first time we ordered size 10, returned them and then ordered a size 13.  We are pleased with the second pair of  moccasins."
"VERY comfortable.  Good color, great price, great delivery!"
"I have purchased these socks before at REI.  They are warm, wear like iron, and stay up.  I have 18 inch calves and I can wear these comfortably.  LOVE 'EM"
"Our girls were fighting over this top, very cute"
I been getting this brand for years. Holds up well.
Love it...a little big but it's fine because outs from 6-12 months so i expected it to be big.
I pinned bangs back.
"Buyer beware: a/c closure stands for something that means Velcro. So if you're looking for a cute easy on and off preschooler shoe that doesn't look Ike a traditional hook loop closure, this is it! But if your child was hoping to learn to tie their own shoes, this pair will not help."
"Very pleased with the cap, looks pretty enough to go out in rather than a less comfortable wig. Soft and comfy and doesn't hurt even after hours or wearing. I should mention, after being measured, I am considered to have a small head, so it fits just right but there's lots of stretchiness to the cap. I will probably buy more colors in this."
Beautiful.  Lays well and looks quality made.
Hot. Hot. Hot.
"My daughter loves these boots. They are cute, well constructed, and she says they are comfortable."
beautifully made and tailored to flatter.  Excellent price.
"I ordered these shirts for my husband whom is an extreme gym buff. He loves to show off all his muscles and this shirt allows him to do just that. The only thing that I don't like is one of his nipples show usually the left one, maybe his chest is broad as he says or the cut is off. I ntoice this with all three colors that we purchased."
If you want thin fabric then these are perfect for you.  I would have preferred them to be a little bit thicker.
Beautiful watch!  Looked exactly as depicted in the photo.  Very elegant and love the band.  The watch arrived perfectly and carefully packaged.
"Love the fit and the memory foam insoles. COMFORTABLE! These are my new ""in-the-house"" shoes."
My daughter and I like this dress.
"Love these!!! I have found that Prana kinda runs big, I am usually a small but I have to get an xxs or xs in this brand!!"
"This dress is great. Pretty much exactly as advertised. Only reason i didn't put 5 stars is because the material is not very soft. Not a lot of stretch, but nice nevertheless."
"I bought it in the size I thought I was, but I forget that I've lost weight, so it was big on me, but true to size. I'm still keeping it and really like it. Columbia is always a great product. I've had many jackets from them."
"The unprotected elastic is a little rough on the skin, but that's what you get for such a low price.  The length is a little long, with the waist to crotch dimension on the longer side.  The 8"" inseam is an inseam measurement, so the overall length is pretty long.  The body of the shorts flares out from the waist a bit, making them a little bigger than necessary relative to the waist dimension."
"Band is very durable and looks really nice.  This is the same color as my original watch band on my Citizen Eco-Drive, but this holding up much better.  My original band had issues with water discoloration and I have not had any issue with my new band.  The watch buckle is very large, but it compliments my watch very well.  If you have a smaller watch or wrist, it might be too large, but its very well built."
"Good looking, sleeker than Sorel Caribou...but the foot padding is not as generous and I will probably add a liner.  Satisfied overall."
"I adore this Triceratops skeleton PJ set... for little boys? Pshhh. Girls dig dinos too! :D I bought this in size 2T for my 19 month old daughter when she gets a bit bigger. I purposely got a size or so too large for later use, and so they do seem to be true to size based on the fact that they definitely don't fit her yet! The fabric is a very nice, hearty yet lightweight cotton, and the screen printing/design aspect is really well-done. The tee-shirt and shorts combo will be perfect to keep her cool on warm nights, but I would go so far as to say that she could easily wear this outfit out in public and nobody would realize it was pajamas, because it's a such a hearty, quality fabric and design. In fact, I like the design so much we will probably do that! I have yet to run this set through the washer and dryer, but I don't expect any issues based on the quality of the fabric. I can't wait for her to grow into this set; she's going to look so adorable!!!! (Please note that I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am in no way affiliated with the seller or with Amazon.)"
I'm so glad I found these shoes! They fit perfect and are super cute. They are comfortable and very well made.
For the price.... A WINNER!!!
Fits my body well. Straps stay put
"Loved it. It is a stunning watch. For the price, you can't beat it; must be holesale . I had to remove two links. It was easy with a tool for that."
"I ordered these from somewhere else 12/13 the fit great. Ordered 2 pair from Amazon both pairs too small. Sending back. ??? Pair that fits from China, others from Vietnam. ???"
"For a cheap Halloween costume, this will do the trick. It fit well -- I wear a size 16-18, and it fits perfectly. The material is thin polyester, and the back is Velcroed closed, so you will need to wear something underneath. Also, the arms are open underneath, which seems sort of odd. Otherwise, considering I plan to wear it for a few hours at a party, it's fine."
"Cheap product at a cheap price.  I have an average sized head and it is really tight.  Since it's plastic, it doesn't have much give to stretch out."
looks great with the khaki pants I bought
"Fits good, and is comfortable. Gives a more natural look, and makes you look a size smaller."
"I ordered the 5T for my 3-1/2 year old, (loves Dinos) I do like to buy pjs a little bigger so he can grow into them and last longer. However these fit him like normal 3T, it fit him perfectly but I was hoping it would be a bit bigger. He will probably out grow them soon."
"Length: I'm 5'9'' these were just fine in terms of leg length for me.

Size: I'm ~220lbs and wear between a size 14/16 and 1x/2x  in other clothing items. I ordered the xlarge-4x option and they fit just fine. However, I am not confident that this will be as comfortable of a fit for someone who wears a true 4x. Based on how they fit me I say it's possible someone who is actually a 4x might not like how they fit.

Material: Polyester seems to be the way to go. It's a great material and it won't get as pilly (those fuzz balls that appear after enough wear and rubbing) between my thighs as quickly as cotton leggings might."
"Beautiful color, very nice rain jacket! Like the reflective tape too."
Very comfortable earring. I've slept in them with no 'pokes' or problems. They stay in securely even with no backs. I highly recommend for a nice simple everyday earring. Quality is quite high.
"I bought this necklace to go with Z&s Mens Slouch Long Beanie Winter Knit Skull Cap Hat Gray B0724.  Perfect match.  Love the colors and one size fits all.  Product does what it claims and was received in the time frame projected on the earlier side than later. But at this price by a couple for the perfect Christmas gift or birthday gift.  Side note, made more for a slender neck person but I am larger than average and it still fits."
"I got a new coat and the pockets are so small, so I bought this purse to put my phone in, and it works great!"
Great product. Exactly what  I wanted.
This bag is beautiful !!!  Very well made and well worth the money.
"These large sunglasses seem to be out of style.  I don't care about style.  I care about what works for me.  These sunglasses work for me.  I've been using this style sunglasses since the 1960's,  I love these glasses.  They look good on me and if you prefer these sunglasses instead of the new, all the rage, aviator or those things that look like reading glasses from the 50's and 60's, these are the sunglasses for you.  The sunglasses got here quickly - very quickly.  I appreciated the vendor's sending them as fast as they did.  This style works for me and if this is the kind you like, it will work for you."
"I was so excited to get this ring in the mail and I was definitely not disappointed. It arrived in a beautiful, classy all black ring box. I opened it up and my eyes almost popped out, it was that beautiful! I love it so much. It's totally believable in all aspects. A quality ring. It was out of stock in my size but I'm so glad that I waited until it was back in to get it, instead of choosing a different ring. This ring is a stunner. Pictures do not capture it's true beauty."
I purchased this for a swimsuit cover up.  I am glad I went up a size when ordering because the top seems to run small. It is slightly tight still but looks good. I don't generally like sparkles on my clothes but there aren't very many anyway. I read the reviews prior to purchasing and saw that the top was a bit small.  I hope this review helps the reader of my review when ordering also.
"I love this hiking boot. In the winter time,  I wear it several times a week. It's comfortable. Sturdy , warm and I think stylish. Keen tend to be on the pricy side but you will get several years wear."
My girl loved it .. very cute and in budget .. worth it
"These are great, and I was so happy I was able to get them zipped.  The calves are tight but with the softer leather, I think they'll wear in just fine.  I have had a hard time getting other Frye boots zipped before, so I went up a size to the 8.5 (my usual size is 8.)  They are a bit long, but that makes it easier to wear with thick socks and not have cramped toes.  Right now, they squeak a little when I walk, but I'm sure that will go away with more wear.  Happy with my new Frye's!"
"Quality is quite good. However this shoe runs small and is extremely narrow. Had to return for larger size.
**Order at least half size up, also runs narrow**"
grandson will grow into them
SHOES WERE THE GIFT ITEM I GAVE TO MY WIFE HERE. SHE LOVES THEM AND DOESNT HURT HER FEET WHEN WEARING.
Good quality and price. I'm very happy with this purchase.
"They look cool,they fit great and they are unique. I love the clear bottoms on them. Also love that they are not the typical bright colored water shoe. Speedo is a great brand so what I got was what I expected...great product."
Low price tie bar's look good for all different occasions and a variety is included. Nice set for low price.
These are nice looking capri cargo style pants.  The are comfortable and fit well everywhere but the length.  If you are a petite person or have short legs they just really don't look right on.  The price is very reasonable and I would reorder them if they had a petite size.
"Overall, the coat is wonderful. As mentioned by other reviewers, sizes run big. I have a big 5 year old and bought the XXS (4/5)  per recommendations and am glad I did. It fits just right and he may even be able to wear it next year. the XS would've been way too big for sure.

size chart on the coat reads:
US size
XXS: 4/5  (I found this would be big on a 4 year old. Fits a ""normal sized"" 5 year old with some room to grow a bit.
XS: 6/7
S: 8
M: 10/12
L: 14/16
XL: 18/20

details I like: pockets have zipper on them; velcro on ends of sleeves so you can adjust them if needed; waterproof fabric; front left breast pocket is made to hold an ipod and has holes for speaker cords to run through."
"I am 142 lbs 28 weeks along and ordered medium, A tiny bit tight around the band hopefully it will stretch out a little as I grow more, not super uncomfortable though. I have the lace trim one and it fits looser and I like it a bit better."
"Very sparkly, special occasion shoe.  my 8 year old granddaughter loved it."
Perfect price and ALL the piercing I need all wrapped up in one! THANK YOU!
i like keen shoes so much that i have purchased black oxford and black duty boot.  Do not think i will every have to wear anything but Keen
"These shoes were more than I expected.  Very comfortable & the price was very reasonable.  Yes, I would highly recommend these to a friend."
"This shirt is cute and light-weight. I wear it with a grey camisole. I would recommend purchasing it! Keep in mind that it is thin material, it won't exactly keep you warm."
I bought two of these purses. They are just as expected. They are very nice leather. They are very functional purses. I am very happy with this purchase!
Actallu thenquailoty In was exspwcting of the brand very happy an pleased
"Thanks to the other reviewers, I received exactly what I expected. This hat is almost exactly what I have been looking for to top off my vintage style outfit when playing hickory golf! (""Hickory Golf"" is playing the game with hickory-shaft clubs and reproduction golf balls of the type used up until the early 1940s.) Fits me well (My hat size is 6 7/8- 7), looks good, and appears to be well-made. Great price!"
Hard to believe that Florida stores did not sell one small enough for the baby and was so happy to find this. Perfect fit for him although a bit long before he is a shortie but will last a few years that way. Well worth the money
"This is my second pair of these amazing slippers.  They are comfortable, warm, easy to slip on and durable. The memory foam insole is one of the best features of these slippers.  My feet are always comfortably toasty.  We do not wear shoes in the house so I wear these slippers all the time.  They are a piece of heaven for the feet and I highly recommend them."
Nice wide shoe with great support. Good for average pace runners i.e. 9 min milers. Good ankle support. I wear a 6 in regular shoes that this fits my insoles
I have received compliments on these shoes. I wish I had gone a half size larger
We put better insoles in them. Then feel and look great.
Great petite crucifix. I can see Jesus.
"I ordered this dress for a 50s themed Christmas party!  Its adorable on and fits me perfectly!  The quality is fine and its comfortabke to wear.  Im 5 10 and 150lbs, 34b on top, and ordered a small according to the measurements listed!  The length was fine because I ordered the crinoline black slip to wear under it to make it puff out, and it gave it some more length.  Looking forward to wearing it to the party in December!"
Love the blue color. Perfect weight. Comfy and good looking.
"Although the sandal did not come in half size a purchased anyhow.  They are a bit large but too cute, I bought them anyway."
Very Good quality I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for champion jackets and the price is very reasonable.
Soft and color is true to photo.
"Love it.
I got them for my Disney vacation and they where adorable. They look just as the ones been sold at the park."
"Pros: Skirt is soft and comfortable, a nice length, can be dressed up or down, folds very compactly for travel, elastic waistband (not foldover which I feel is not flattering when you already have plenty of padding in that area!)

Cons: Overpriced, very thin, unlined, kind of clingy

I will have to wear a long shirt with this to feel comfortable, but it's ok"
"Comfortable cover up, product as described."
Love this purse! I love the size. It feels really sturdy. I've had it for a few months and haven't had any problems so far. Still looks good. And keeps my stuff dry in the rain.
"I easily get Achilles tendonitis, especially with the regular athletic shoes.  These shoes are comfortable, supportive, cute, and the back doesn't press on my Achilles.  I am going to get more colors."
Amazing as pictured and great quality and price.
Extremely comfortable and stylish
You know they're not going to last long but what does when you give it to a toddler? These were fun for the kids to wear while decorating cookies at their Halloween party
This shoe is very comfortable and fit as expected.
"If you need a little bit of bling without being gaudy, this is the one. Delicate, well made, and the chain is nice too."
"Ahhh - comfort and cool style.  No pain between the toes with these, as they're soft fabric."
Better quality than seen in pictures!
"I bought a total of 4 pairs of these necklaces and all of them worked. They were great for a Holiday party, not too bright to make it distracting, but bright enough to be a happy addition to our outfits."
Need to be longer
"I have these in navy and cream. Comfy, comfy, comfy."
Great bras comparable to Motherhood Reese bra. I am a 36c and ordered a medium. It fits on the last hook but that will allow me to tighten it later if the elastic wears over time. The snap works very easily with one hand.
Great jacket. I'm a size 6 and ordered the XS. Small was way too big.
great color and wash up nice
I've received the smaller size and it fits. The boot is not as cushioned as I would like but it okay.
"I love it honestly. I don't worry about ""slipping"" or rather my slip sliding down and peeking out from under my skirt/dress. I feel more secure if it's a windy day and my skirt/dress is blowing. I love it so much, I got all (3) colors."
"Many thanks.

The product is great. More than expected. The shoes are just as shown in the picture.

Best regards,"
I love these. They fit great. I love mizuno's.
These stretchy jeans are perfect for everyday wear....they move with you.  The waist is where an older woman wants it to be and not hung low.  The legs are slim enough but not too slim for getting your feet into them with shoes on...I love the stretchy feel and I think that is what makes them so soft and not stiff like many other jeans I have had.  The back has some bling that makes it look like pockets but aren't...this makes for smooth fit that actually slenderizes.  The front zipper is flat without working it to make flat and the top button is easily buttoned.
ordered a 4x and im a womens l/xl... couldve used a 5x or 6x
"Nice fabric hangs and drapes pretty nice. I'm 5'4"" 138# bought large. Neck fits comfortably and arms were perfect. I like it."
As usual vionic has delivered a cute comfortable sandal.  The Velcro straps make this shoe adjustable to some feet.
My husband loves these and now my teen boys are asking for their own pair.  I will be purchasing more for sure.  :)
I've been buying from Woman Within for years and have always been happy with my purchases.  This time around I bought two pairs of these jeans in two different colors.  One pair was a bit longer and larger than the other pair.  The difference wasn't enough to return either pair but it does make you wonder about WW's quality control.
"Nothing outstanding either good or bad, these fit as advertised (slightly slim on a slim person) and look just fine."
"Look super, super tiny in package, but they really do stretch to fit. I am 5'6, 140 lbs, medium fit great"
So far these are the best open toe support knee highs I have found.  They wear well and are very comfortable.  I plan to order more of them.
These boots are wonderful!  They are warm and soft and really comfortable.  They are nice and thick and fluffy inside and they feel like you are walking on a cloud.  I wear a 7.5 and have wide feet so I bought an 8 and they are perfect with or without socks.  With the fleecy insides it feels like they are surrounding your feet and legs with cushioning.  I used a heavy duty silicone water repellant on them (only one coating because I bought them one day and used them the next) and they stayed dry in over 12 inches of snow (this was the most expensive brand of water repellent they had).  With socks and pants tucked in they are snug enough with the fleece that snow does not get down inside of the boot.  They stayed totally dry on a recent trip to the mountains with trudging through snow drifts well over the boot top and my feet were warm and dry the entire time.  Mine were a great deal at a sporting goods store for their winter sale just like another reviewer.
"this was for my brother in law whom is about 6' 2"" with a medium build. the sleeves passed the stretching out of arms and laying on the waist test."
"The top looks and fits good. Run large. I would like better done ends of threads, that I'm sitting now with a needle and hide them."
"I wear a women's size 11N shoe and ordered a size large in these socks. The length was good, but they were just too wide. Went with the Teko Women's Summit Merino Midweight instead."
I ordered this swimsuit because it looked so pretty in the picture.  I was not disappointed.  I ordered a large.  I have size D breast and clothes size 10-12.  This suit looks amazing on.  I'm heading to Iceland and plan to rock this in The Blue Lagoon!  Happy birthday to me!!
These slippers can be worn outside.  They are very warm as they cover the ankle and they have true orthotics. They are easy to put on. These are my new go to for around the house shoes (and out of the house shoes).
"Such an elegant and understated way to carry one's beach items, books, yarn, and anything else you can think of. It is durable, and has very subtle colors"
Great quality. These are stunning and the fit is right on point.
I did wear them for almost 8 hours but it probably wasn't the shoes but my feet were tired since  I helped my daughter move!  Great shoe.  Great fit.
"Love this, have an all black dress code at work (ninja) and this acts a little spice to my outfits"
"As a business person that regularly wears ties, I can assure you this is not a fine silk tie. If that's what you're expecting than you shouldn't purchase this product.

On the other hand, in a novelty occasion (seasonal for example) this tie is of exceptional quality! I would compare its quality to typical ties found in department stores that price around $15-35. The material does not look or feel cheap, and the red color is vivid and catches the eye (like most red ties are designed to do). The small christmas trees are subtle, yet well detailed on the tie. This does not scream ""cheesy"", but rather presents a festive look around the holidays.

The width and length of the tie are fairly standard and compare well with most of the ties I normally purchase (There is a ""skinny"" version available, but this is more traditional for my body type - 6'0"" - 175lbs).

Definitely a good edition to the tie collection for holiday parties during the appropriate time of year."
"I'm wearing mine as I write this post! I bought these hoping they would fit under my jeans and pants even though they're lined with fleece. They fit perfectly! I live in New England and am facing the frigid weather by wearing these under my tight fitting pants. I'm 5'2, and 115 lbs and these fit me perfectly. Although these come with a rancid burning rubber smell to them, I think these leggings are worth letting them air out a bit before wearing."
"I remember clearly chose XL in shopping cart, receive goods scared myself, have a look at the order is XXL, do not know why will appear this kind of mistakes."
"I give it 5 stars because my son refuse to wear anything else but Dickie's to work, also they hold up through many washes.  The fitting is different than his other clothes, we have had to play around with the Dickie styles & sizes, finally the 874 Original at 30W x 31L.  He wears 29W x 32L jeans and khaki's.  These are higher waist pants, I am sure that plays a role but when we bought his normal length it was way too long, hence the 31L worked perfectly.  Also, the rear is baggier than we want, he is medium to slender build.  Hope this helps!"
"Love this shirt fits,  well I'm a large."
Nice hat. Lovely color and material. Cant wait to wear it on the beach
"Denim color is awesome. I love the front pockets, almost like a baby bootcut"
Very bohemian chic!!!
Pretty Sweater!  My teenager loves it!
Great shoes my 16 month old loves them
This was a good gag gift for a Father's Day gift. He said Mary I can't wear this all offended. I let it go but have noticed him rocking it pretty often. The shirt fits as expected. The shirt and printing are both good quality.  The item was shipped and delivered in a timely manner.
These shoes seem to be well made and are sturdy. It is too bad he will grow out of them before they even begin to show wear!
My fiance still wears his I would if I could but I'm not allowed to wear jewelry at work
"I like it a lot.  I'd originally bought it so that I could carry my ipad air.  It doesn't fit, but I kept the purse anyway.  Don't expect it to take a whole lot.  I graduated to it from a wallet purse.  I got the Ashley for those occasions when I want to carry my ipad."
I love these jeans.  The material stretches a little so they are very comfortable compared to some jeans that can be restrictive when sitting.  I wear these several days a week.  I just wish they had more denim styles available in my size.
Adorable! Purchased for pictures for my baby. Loved it!
I love my skull cardigan. I wish I'd have ordered two. It's my favorite new sweater.
Nice jacket that runs small in size
Ordered this for my son. He loves it.
Shipping was fast and it is an okay product. The gems are light colored and do not appear to be real so I think the ring is a bit pricey considering.
"I love these dresses! Simple, elegant, attractive, lightweight, comfortable. I buy the ones with the full back. Add layers and accessories to dress up or keep simple to relax in."
"Love this shoe. Don't think I would wear it to run in but for the price, it's good for a casual/fashion sneaker. Not a ton of arch support."
"Very comfortable dress shoe. I usually have issues with dress shoes being too narrow in toe area, but this shoe has plenty of room and doesn't pinch or rub. This is the 2nd pair of Naturalizer N5 sandals and I am happy with both."
Sturdy and holds tons. My duaghter
I'm 6ft 2inches with a slim build and these fit as expected(medium 32-34); not too tight not too loose. The material isn't too thick but light. The colors are brighter than expected but that's not an issue for me. I've had them for a few months now and they haven't faded or stretched out. I definitely recommend these.
Fit as expected. This is my second (set) time purchasing them after using the first set for a year. They're great. They do not slip off the back of my heel.
"It is difficult to find sz 13 mens shoes anymore that fit true to sz. These do. The quality is great, not cheap, flimsey looking. A good price for a good product. We will buy again from this source! Thanks"
So far this one doesn't disappoint.  Seems to be made well and holds up and doesn't sag when you load it up.
Fit great and just the replacement slipper I was looking for.
So pretty and very soft! Great for our trip north for a winter vacation. Good quality for the price.
If you have thick thighs these are 100% going to roll down on you. Theres really no way around it.  You have have to wear them lower.  But overall they are a nice quality sock.
"Lovely and soft.  I have no idea what to call this color, it would not have been ""salmon"", but whatever it is, it garnered me more compliments than any other piece of clothing I own.  Mostly for the color but the cut was flattering too.  I want more of these!"
"SO CUTE! This is my new favorite suit. I wanted something sporty and tropical for a cruise and this is seriously PERFECT! For reference, I am 5'5, 145 lbs, 34D and a have pretty big bubble butt. The bottoms are super comfy.. not too low, not too high and do not cut in on the sides. The top is pretty supportive, but definitley not something I could play volleyball in. My only complaint is the cut on the top. It gives me a little bit of side boob, but not enough to return it or need a larger size. I would recommend going up a size than your normal. I am a size M @ Victorias Secret and the large in this was perfect. Highly recommend this suit!"
I love it the colors are very vibrant against the black. it is a little snug in the booby area for me.
"Great dress. Wore it onboard Alaska cruise for one formal night. Fantastic! I felt like a princess.  I am 5'1 and wear size 10P I ordered a size XL(ouch) but that's how it measured-out.
It is short-waisted so the dress was petite, however I had to shorten it about 4 inches because I will wear flats."
"Gift Item, Appears to be a good fit!"
Beautiful Earrings that seem to hold their luster.  I have worn these several times and am thrilled that they still look like rose gold.
This was a gift for my boyfriend. He really enjoys wearing it and thinks its funny!
"Nice price, light weight, expandable."
"Very nice ring, it looks just like the picture. It came in a gift box."
I have a head full of hair. This fits like a glove.
Perfect fit. The Velcro on every step makes it a little hard to adjust at first but once you take some time to sort it all out they're perfect.
"Very stylish  had a nice feel and good quality, but I was in the market for polarizes sunglasses and These turned out not to be. If you don't need polarized sunglasses I highly recommend them."
was my husbands shirt for our wedding. Was what I wanted
"These are my go to running shoes.  I know that they will always fit and give me the support I need for my daily runs.  I have never had a blister, and never lost a toe nail.  I love these shoes."
"Very comfortable, but my low instep requires a foam insert. I have foot troubles, and these are great!"
NO  PROBLEMS
Looks great on my bracelet! Love it!
"My Mom loves them! And, the price is right!"
These are really cute and my daughter loves the foam insole.....but they show alot of wear very quickly.
"Pattern is cute, dress is extremely shorter than I expected and very low cut in the front."
Great for casual or dress wear.
"I bought these mainly for snow shoeing and winter hiking. I am an average weight 5' 7"" female and I ordered a men's medium. I find them to fit fine if they are just going over hiking pants or jeans, but they are quite tight when I put them over my insulated snow pants. Still, they do fit and stay on/up well, and seem well-made for the price."
"When you need tide times this is really handy..this is a great product. Trickey to set acurratly, but does work well."
I love them .  I've worn them several times.  Thank you
Very comfortable. After taking a shower.
"This watch arrived fully charged.  Timekeeping is accurate but there is a learning curve involved with the reading and understanding of the operators manual so be prepared.  A lot to learn to properly understand this watch.  And as seems to be the case with Casio watches, the face will scratch if you look at it wrong.  Be aware of that."
"I need this in more colors! I love it, it is flowy and the sleeves are flattering for this older chick. The washing/care label can't be read after one wash but that is my only complaint. Hopefully someone here can tell me if I can put it in the dryer. I don't think so but figured I'd ask."
Saucony sneakers have always fit me well. This is the first time I ordered them on line and they were a perfect fit!
Very cute but waaay too big. The reviews said runs small but that isn't correct. I have reordered a half size smaller . Hopefully they will fit. Nice leather flat for my daughter. Can be dressed up or down.
"I have owned various Dockers pants over the years. This is my first ""relaxed fit"" (groan). So far, they fit and are reasonably comfortable."
very COMFY and beautiful exactly what I wanted and expected would recommend this product highly to anyone looking for the perfect cardigan
"This top is fun to wear and looks great.  It is starting to pill a bit, and that's disappointing."
Super cool and well made. Can't wait to give it to my son.
My husband Loves this shirt!
LOVE how cool this keeps me while indoors and outdoors!  Great product!
"Interesting to order an XL for my size 10 foot, but these fit pretty well, even if the tops really don't snug to my chicken legs as well as the Larges do to my wife's shins.  The real test comes in a few weeks in The Narrows in Utah.  Our warm river here lets me test them (inside Chaco Tedinho Bulloo Boots) walking back and forth to see if they stay comfortable in the Chacos, but we'll see how they do when the water's much chillier."
Was very surprised at how well this pair of shoes looked and felt; considering the price It looks better than more expensive shoes I own and I am likely to purchase more of this brand.
I love it so much that I ordered another ring but differently and I will order more products. ...
"Great swim top. Loved the softer color scheme from most bathingsuits. Fit great, especially liked the bust support, and that it doesn't gap if I lean over. The top does float up in the water, that's to be expected with the style (I just tucked a corner into my swim bottoms when in water)."
"These are great. Not as thick as Lululemons but they feel like good quality. I am 5'7"", about 135 and I wear 6/8. I got a medium and it fits well. I think I would be able to get into a small and get more compression but I did not want that for these. The waist is really high, stays up while working out."
"Great product, I have order more than one on occasion..."
"When I let him wear them the first time he was thrilled that they lighted up, went running and jumping to see them light up.  They are a little big, which I purposely ordered, makes it easier for him to be able to put on.  Well constructed shoe."
I wear these waterproof shoes primarily while walking my dogs and working in the yard.  They're easy to slip on and off and keep your feet dry while walking in wet areas.  They're easily cleaned with a cloth or with a hose.
"Oh heaven! I ordered this hoping it would be relaxed fit, and not sure looking at the model. It came a couple days ago nicely packed and there was a cute little tag that popped out when I opened the bag, ""This is Humongous"", and it is! I just love that. This sleeper is like having an old friend you can just be casual with! It is lightweight, as I wanted, and very soft brushed cotton. The cute comment on the front is soft lettering, not stiff al all, and there is a touch of gold outline on the lettering- this is just darling all around! It does have a real button-up front, but it's more a style, I was easily able to pop it over my head to put it on. I am 5'3"" and this hangs a few inches above my ankle, so when I sit it drapes nicely for just a slight warmth if I need it. I am going to buy a couple more of these. They are inexpensive but well made and so very comfortable- worth it!
11/17/16 Update, I bought another one, the bright pink, I just love the comfort and these are very cute sleep shirts for low prices!"
Adorable!! Great quality!
My son plays a lot of soccer for high school and other teams.  His shoes come off his feet and smell like they've visited the depths of hell.  This device has helped get them dry.  I would recommend it.
"Fits as expected. Quality is good and price is right. The only complain would be that there are no holes on the pockets for the water to drain, other than that...perfect."
"Cute suit and very forgiving, however it may not work for anyone with a large bust. The cups are small and stiff."
Loved it! Wore these shorts on my cruise to bahamas! I like that they don't have those pesky nets on the inside!
"Today is my first day home ,opened package put shoes on and did not want to take them off,they are sooooooo comfortable,color is more than perfect,very rich looking.  So glad Amazon had them at a very good price to boot."
Best fit ever. Will only buy these from now on.
"I purchased these in the black and I think they are so cute and comfortable. I wear them with a dress, shorts, jeans, and capri's. I would say they run true to size, or a little smaller. If you wear a 1/2 size I would go up. A little spendy but I would buy them again"
I bought this for my daughter to give her friend for Christmas. It was the perfect inexpensive gift. Great quality.
They fit great i really like them
Great quality. It fits well and looks great!
"Good value for the money. Simple but does the job,"
Super cute but they run a little small. I would recommend ordering a size up.
"These are cute and very soft, I wish they came in different colours so I could buy all of them!"
"I was looking for a Dragon Ball shirt for my kid, who is a Goku freak and ended of buying it for myself. The color is awesome and the symbols are very clear. As soon as I wash it I will update the review depending on the results."
"The shoes are like walking on pillows. The memory foam is great, I wear these all day long. I wouldn't say it provides arch support, only because of the foam but I love them. I always wear them when I travel because of the comfort and because they're easy to slip on and off at the airport."
Nice looks and nice touch.
"Roomy bag, seems pretty sturdy."
Got this for a friend who had made medic with me at a top fire department as a congrats. It's pretty lightweight and chain is pretty cheap. But neither one of us wanted something that we'd regret too much if it got yanked off by a patient. Not the highest quality but good for the price.
"My husband loves it. In fact, I bought another pair for him. Good length, nice and light material."
Comfortable and go with everything!  Love them!
"Love these Undershirts, so soft and great quality, a new favorite."
"These shoes are absolutely excellent !
=============================

I usually wear a size 10  or 11, and I ordered the 11.
They fit perfectly with just a little space left in front of the toe.

The shoe is incredibly light, soft and very very comfortable.
Absolutely NO pressure points while walking!!!

Im planning on using them while on the boat and I think they will be absolutely perfect for:  driving the truck to the ramp, walking on a wet dock or boat and walking along the beach.

Since they are all mesh they should dry very rapidly.

This shoe is much much better than a sandal and you won't look like a dork ;)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
worked okay while in brazil for world cup. no issues though
Quality peice. Classic design. I love it.
Looks great under fitted clothing like dresses and tights.. you cant see any seams. Only gave it a 4 because the thigh part continuously rolls up which is annoying but they're still wearable and looks natural.
AWESOME...G/F LOVES IT!!
The dress is a beautiful dress is a little bit big but will be okay as soon as I take it up then it'll be perfect
Perfect for what I needed; beautiful color. Might get one in another color.
"Ive bought this as a gift for my husband, it fits very well and it is comfortable. Nice color too."
LOVE OPI!
"Very warm, comfortable and fashionable, loves it so much!"
Perfect Christmas gift! My son loved them !
"Fell in love with these! Bought them initially as a gift, but kept them for myself :)"
Super cute & fits well around the legs. Fun & adorable for the spring & summer weather!
"very nice buy for the price, will be great in the summer when its hot out"
"The hips fit a ""smij"" small at first, but once I wore them a couple of times, they stretched out and now they fit perfectly.  My hips are a size 39 using a measuring tape and I bought a size 10. The ties at the bottom were annoying so I pulled them out. They look cute on too; just as they are in the photo. As a matter of fact I have them on right now.  : )"
This is the second bra of this style that I have purchased. It fits well and is comfortable.
"Late in the season to give the shoes the real critique. I wore them once and felt very comfortable from the first tee.  Nice shoe, Good buy. First time without spikes and enjoyed the experience comfortably."
Great for the price. Closes well. Doesnt seem cheap. My ears don't turn colors or anything weird like that. I love having four different colors - I wear loops every day!
"These jeans/pants were awesome. I brought them for my 17 year old son who is 140lbs @ 5'8. After reading thoroughly and reading the questions that were being asked, I decided to go with the size that I had gone with. He normally wears, at this time, a waist size of 32, but bc of his height, I opted for size 33. I was correct! Great delivery, they looked fantastic on him down 2 his ankle, yet somewhat large around his waist. Nothing a belt or a few washes won't fix, lol. Thinking of getting him the blue ones next!! Thank you Amazon and Orlik."
"If only he would have just kept his mouth shut sometimes... I like the shirt, most other people don't and that's exactly why I bought it. Fits good!"
"i'm 5'8 and 145 and this apron fits me well
sometimes i fold the apron and tie it to make it shorter. I use it as an esthetician. Cleans well does what it should."
"I read this on the bag where this handbag was shipped from"" smart is beautiful"" I liked it so much and applies so well to this purchase. Great size, not too big not too small, very good quality, a bag to enjoy without feeling guilty, and it looks like it will wear well because the grainy leather is  sturdy."
"Perfect for small gifts, it presents them elegantly."
"This is one of the nicer shirts I have bought on Amazon. It's comfortable and looks good on me -which is hard as I am a very large person and getting anything to look decent on me is difficult. This shirt is somewhat over-sized which makes it extra comfortable- especially under the arm pits -where any Big Guy will tell you is the most uncomfortable when you try to swing your arms when you are wearing a shirt- if the shirt isn't well made. If the price stays within the $30 area, I'll buy again. Additional colors though would be nice."
"Very cute.  I was a little disappointed that both straps were not adjustable.  I have very narrow feet and the second, non-adjustable, strap is loose.  The shoe still fits well but that strap bags out a bit."
I like it very much.  Believe it looks chic.
Beautiful shoes - many compliments!
The top was more like a belly shirt! But over all everything else about it was great I didn't use the tutu that came with it I had one that was rainbow and glitter I used and it looked great. I gave the pink one to a friend!
"This is my 3rd review of this brand, but must say that this brand is a real find for me! Love the fit and feel! I have washed these many times  and they still look new."
Very awesome hat with that rugged look. Love it.
Just what I was looking for at a reasonable price!
"This backpack is a great color, true to the deep purple in the picture. It has plenty of pockets which helps organize the items you pack in it and distribute weight.  It folds up really easily which makes it nice to store or take as an extra overflow bag for traveling.  The fabric is lightweight which is both greatm....and not so great. Great because in it of itself it's not heavy. Not so great because it has no shape under weight if you pack the front too heavily and it also causes the zippers to stick a bit.  Neither of these things take away from how handy this pack is but I did take away 1 star.  I'd still recommend it!"
"Let me first say that this company is wonderful. I loved this watch. Had to take out three clips to fit, but when I got home to set it, I noticed it wasn't running. I could not get it to work. Sent Amazon a note. They said send it back. But, I didn't want to send it back. So, I contacted the company. Not only did they tell me not to send it back, but replaced it. No charge. No back and forth mailing costs. Now that's service. It works great. Sized down so now it fits great, too. I love this watch!"
"Beautiful, delicate and stylish. Packaged very elegantly !"
this is so cute! exactly what I have been looking for!
"Exactly what I needed. I live in California, and this winter there have been mornings in the 30s and low 40s during which my fingers were freezing in typical cotton knit gloves that are usually fine up here. These mittens look great with the knitted pattern, and the thinsulate lining is super soft. Excellent buy!"
I am impress with this bralette.  It is super comfortable and YES sexy under that low back shirt!  I love it!
"This lightweight shawl is a beautiful color, but wrinkles easily.  On the whole, quite nice, will be pretty under the color of dark winter coats."
Great pair of sandals for my 2.5 year old.  He loves them.  They are easy to put on & take off for him too!
"I own several sets of clipon sunshades. I like this pair the best. I am especially impressed with the build quality and the design of the clips themselves - the springy bits that attach the shades to the glasses themselves. They inspire confidence, both in the firmness of their grip and the gentleness of the protective padding that actually contacts the lens.

They are also light. I have another pair with carefully designed clips, but they are heavy and leave a rather noticeable and painful crease on the bridge of one's nose after several hours of use. These clipons, by contrast are light and I hardly notice I am wearing them.

Also, when you flip the shades up away from the lenses, they click firmly into place at solid right angle.

I would highly recommend these."
My nephew loved the look of the shoes and regularly wears them to play tennis. The shoes were a tiny bit tight for his size in the beginning but we expect them to widen a bit after a few wears.
"These shoes are perfect for ""running around"" in summer, fall too  - the leather and sole are super-soft and comfortable.  Because the leather is so soft the need no break-in time; they are almost like gloves for your feet.  Because the sole is springy-soft, they are comfortable to wear even if you have foot problems.  The purple color is especially fun, many people have commented on how cute they are.  I believe they are a bit on the wider size - just a little bit - for ecco slip-on shoes ... they fit me fine even though I often choose wide-width shoes.  However, this might be because the uppers are so flexible, they will accommodate a little  wider foot.  The size length-wise seems to be just about right.  So now I'm snatching up any and all colors available in my size at these great prices!"
"I adore these! They are tiny and the colors go great with lots of outfits, they are comfortable, I wore them all day and had no irritation."
"Great color, Great Fit.  What else could you want in a pair of jeans.  After wearing these a few times, I went back and bought another pair in a different color.  Equally pleased with the 2nd pair."
"Well, I haven't used this set yet, but I'm really excited about it! The colors and design are absolutely adorable. The bright pink is so fun.  I love that the hoodie comes with because it will be a perfect addition for winter."
These are very cute and very well made.  I kept them even though I am still not sure if I will use them as my wedding shoes in six months.  I think the toe hold is a bit large for my taste - wish it was more of a peep-toe.  But the rhinestones are really high quality and the shoe itself is lovely.
I really like this ...it's simple and yet it looks good. This my favorite of the ones that I bought. I bought it for an Xmas gift but I am thinking that I may keep this one for myself
i love this pair of shoes
True to size and good quality for the price.
nice and light fabric
"Ones again I'm very impressed with the quality of this brand name ""Soojun""... Not regrets.. Strongly recommended..!"
Great gift for hairdresser
perfect product bought 2 more
"I have this bra in 3 different colors. I love it. It's fairly comfortable and keeps everything where it's supposed to be (and still) when I run. It does flatten you out, so doesn't have the most flattering silhouette if that matters to you."
"Nice Looking, stylish, and super comfortable, however like reviews mentioned if you have very athletic legs, the calf area may be too tight.  I have defined muscular legs, but not bulky or athletic curves, more lanky.  My only concern is that I can imagine suede can only be so waterproof  (as they claim they are), so I am interested to see how they wear in the Seattle wet winters.  I live in Florida, so we don't have much opportunity to wear boots, but two weeks in downtown Seattle in December can make you appreciate some warm, comfortable  boots to kill the chill.  I will check back after this winter trip.  Great price/Cute Boots! Happy!"
"My 5-year old was thrilled with this new coat, and so am I. The color is really cute!"
"I'd like to give these a 10 star rating. I've been an avid hiker for years and these are by for the most comfortable hiking shoes I've ever owned. I absolutely love them and wear them often, even when I'm not hiking. Great traction and flexibility. I've been bragging on them so much that my husband asked me to buy him a pair, which I did."
"I normally wouldn't buy footwear on line but I did and these are great. Fit well, look sweet and feel comfortable."
"Purchased these for my mother.  She called me and told me that they fit perfect, wore all day shopping. Totally loves them."
It's a great costume. I even got some comments about how nice of a costume it is.
"Teva is one of my favorites, great styles, good fit, comfortable thong and fair price"
"Very bulky, but if that is what you are looking for, then this is the product for you"
"Soft leather, good quality fit. The chunky heel makes it very comfy"
Good pair of pants. The only down side might be an upside to some. They are great for hiking and camping but the seam on the back makes them a little too casual for everyday use.
Great purchase!!! Not designed for heavy duty use but perfect for candies
Thin material... shows every jiggle... but nothing a long tunic top couldn't hide!
"Dress is gorgeous, but large was too small for me.  I will have to return it.  I loved this gown."
great as a sleep shirt during the winter!!  This is the third one I have bought becasue they work so good!
"Excellent...very soft sole as usual..happy w/the color choice..stands out..I really prefer Havaianas Top flip-flops over any of their styles that they offer because of the butter soft sole, it's much thicker...another happy purchase & my flippies arrived very promptly....these flip-flops are SUPREME..:)"
"This is a great sturdy, supportive winter boot.  Keeps feet dry and warm and feel lighter on then they look. size 13"
Perfect condition just was a tad small
Nice quality have had one for a year holding up good bought this one for the wife.
Love this tank and wear it all the time but the lace on the back is very fragile and has torn already.. I've had it about a month
It fits perfect and the material is comfortable.
Great for kids trying to tell time!
Great shape. Fits perfectly. Thank you.
"Nice pants. Bought for my husband, who likes pleated pants with cuffs.  Pants fit well especially with comfort waist.  Great price for cotton pants.  Bought in 3 different colors.  Washes well and wrinkle-free out of dryer.

JG in San Diego."
"Big fan of Rocky and this shirt has a great fit, design and material are great to."
"I didn't really realize from the picture that it would be shimmery, but it's grown on me. Its a nice color and well constructed - I've had it for months and though the pockets were really tight to begin with, they have loosened up a bit for easier use without any stitches or seams coming undone."
really nice polo shirt
"Love mizuno. Lightweight and comfy. Can wear them all day. Not a runner, great for walking . I'm a fan"
The Best Winter Boot I've had the pleasure of owning! Really Rough and rugged. Wraps around your feet in warm comfort.
"I am a repeated customer and have repeatedly bought this product. It is very well make. The cut is good and the pouch is well... ""flattering"". The material is very sound and smooth to touch. I love this. This is a top quality product that is priced very well. You get 4 of these for what you would normally have to pay for just 1 trunk of this quality. I highly recommend this product."
These are super cute and they have just the prettiest pink soles that pop against the rubber upper. The upper part is a sort of whitish gray color that reminds me of an overcast sky. Add the pink flowers and it's just like spring time in shoe form. But my absolute favorite thing about them is the fabulous box that they come in it's the prettiest yellow flowered girly suprise bonus that I will be keeping random stuff inside of for probably forever ever.
"This was bought as a Mother's day gift for a friend. It is EXACTLY what I was looking for!!! It is simple but beautiful, my friend will love it! I also like that the company that makes these has a wide variety of necklaces similar to this one - ex...2 parents with different numbers of children etc. I am very happy with this purchase."
"This costume was delivered on time.  Over all it fit well and could be adjusted to each person easily.  The only ""downfall"" was that the ""boots"" kept falling down."
"Got them for my wedding, and now I just wear them to bum around the house in."
I'm a b cup and it fit cute and comfortably. would buy again. beige was as pictured.
Purchased it for grandson. He states shoe improved his bowling.  He likes the shoe!
"This arrived fast! I mean for it coming from out of the states I was shocked! It was like a week!
It came in great shape, but had a strong plastic/chemical smell to it. That was gone after washing.
I'm 5'3 and am well endowed in the chest area, but this still covers me. It isn't going to be warm in a snow storm mind you. It is warm but lighter, which I like not being weighed down. It is super soft and super cute! Love it! I need to get my daughter one now :)"
I have purchased again.
I really like the watch itself.  The band is not leather and is difficult to buckle.  Will need to put another band on.
Suits our needs perfectly.
Love the sunglasses & ordered 2more although this isn't the correct pik of them.
great for grandbaby!!!
One of my favorite pairs of jeans. As comfortable as sweatpants. Nice stretch but don't stretch out much at all. Love!
This case was very good quality for the price
"I walked 70 Miles in one week in these to break them in. Let me tell you, my feet really appreciated them. Very comfortable. I will buy a few more and keep one pair in my  Zombie Apocalypse Survival Kit."
It's as advertised.
"These are cute and still vibrant after several washed. They're thin, though so they're not going to hold up for very long, I can tell. One pair got a hole from removing the platic string that holds them together."
"I love the look of the opal's fire with the amethyst. It's very sparkling and eye-catching.

The band is thick, nicely so and sturdy, so I don't think I'll need to worry about the ring bending out of shape with wear.

The opal on mine is slightly off center vertically, but only by a fraction of a millimeter, so it's unnoticeable unless you're staring at the ring for more than a few seconds. I don't consider it a drawback, really. It's a $15 ring, I wasn't expecting complete perfection.

Overall, I'm quite happy with this ring."
I absoulelt loved this sandal the only problem I had was the color it is a cherry wood .I thought it was brown or light brown I ended up giving it away because I could not match it with anything. I did wear it in my house to see how they feel and they were amazing and stylish.
Wonderful buy! My husband and I are very pleased for the price. The only thing we didn't realize was that it must be plugged in and does not allow for batteries.
My daughter likes them she gets frustrated that she has to redo the toe loop each morning but otherwise happ with them
"Overall I like this purse and it's quite attractive.  On the plus side, it's a nice size, the color I ordered (pink) is true to the color on the screen, the lining is a light color making it easier to locate whatever, and the handle is wide so it doesn't slip off the shoulder.  Also the outside pocket fits my iPhone 6s which is a must for me.  On the negative side, the hardware is unnecessarily too heavy and I don't like interior center pockets.  Overall the positives outweigh the negatives making this purse well worth the reasonable price."
Beautiful & pretty sturdy. Worked exactly what I needed it for.
"I am very happy with these shoes.  It's a good thing I like purple because the wineberry color is PURPLE.  I wear an 8 1/2 closed shoe, but the 8 fits my arch perfectly.  The style is much cuter than most ortho shoes and goes with almost everything."
"A beautiful pair of dress shoes, very comfortable in width and height."
This is such a soft and comfortable cardigan the color I got is really good it is really light but exceptionally warm I highly recommend this cardigan
Excellent active insulation layer. I compared its warmth with the MH Thermal Pro 200 MM and it was both lighter and warmer. It took a few safety pins to tailor the waist size to fit me properly but that was only a 2 minute modification.
"LOVE them!  Super cute on, color as expected.  They do run a teensy bit large; I usually wear a size 7.5 but, based on the reviews, I went with a 7.  I'm glad I did, but they fit exactly and there is no room at all.  My toes don't hang off the edge, but they are close!  I would definitely recommend these wedges.  I've only worn them once and they do become a bit uncomfortable after a while.  I've spent quite a bit of time trying to find the perfect wedge and I think I found it!"
"This suit exceeded my expectations, because some of the negative reviews worried me. First of all, the pink is a beautiful hot pink leaning slightly toward magenta. The fit is good, maybe a bit loose; I could've possibly gone one size down. For reference (and because reading people's measurements/sizing helped me), I am 5'9"" and 165 lbs with a rather full butt & hip area but only a 36B bust size. Because of this, with swimsuits, I would normally wear a M on top and a M or L on bottom. Pant size is usually around 8, give or take, and I usually wear a S or M on top. This suit fits well on both top and bottom, and the style is very flattering and slimming. I highly recommend it and I'm even considering buying another one in a different color!"
"Great shirt.  I got the Bangladesh made one made from cotton and polyester. Washed twice so far.  Dry it till a bit damp and hang for no wrinkles.  Not necessarily a shirt to keep you cool, but looks great and is well made."
"Love love love these shoes. I've only had them for a week so I can't say much about the quality, but they're comfortable and adorable!"
These are great sneakers!  I've owned them before and will continue purchasing them as needed.
"they were too long,my fault should have gotten petite"
A little snug but will stretch
"A little small, and very thin material that isn't heat resistant. Still, pretty good for a novelty item."
"These are nice shorts. I like the pockets and the elastic waistband. Just know that if you rip out the tag, you will have to repair the seam."
"This ring is beautiful! I've had my eye on it for a while & finally purchased it. It is so sparkly & very feminine, but not too small. The setting is very pretty with a neat design. Highly recommend!!"
"Dress is very cute, the fabric is soft and my daughter looks really adorable in it. She is 4 months okd and wearing the size for 6-9 months"
"Very Pretty Necklace.  Of course, it ALWAYS looks bigger in the ad.  My lady loves it, and it looks very elegant on her."
"These shoes look  stylish,  comfortable, and I'm very happy with my purchase!"
Great....perfectly satisfied!!
Nice quality my daughter uses it Daily
"So cute, Best Quality Of Any Other onesies and awesome colors that don't fade!"
"But they do run small.  Order one size larger and you will be very pleased!  The color, sticthing and texture are very good and the double loops make it even better!"
"Fits well and comfortable, good for work out or just relaxing"
Local store stopped carrying Rockports last year but I really like the fit so I bought this shoe. More value for money spent
"I ordered and XL, as that is the size I usually wear and so does the person I ordered it for. It wasn't even close to a fit. It runs about 2 sizes smaller than normal, and is really as small fitting Medium! The lace on the shirt was a slightly more off-white than the blouse. It wasn't a lot, but enough that the top would probably not look good with white bottoms! Other than all that, it is a darling blouse!"
"Some time ago, I bought an amethyst pendant from Amazon to go with a pair of earrings I received as a gift. The pendant's stone was a lot darker than my earrings which are probably more of a Rose de France color. I wore them together and was disappointed that they didn't match better. Then I saw that these earrings from Amazon seemed to have the same style of setting as the pendant, but from the online picture, the stones seemed much darker than the pendant stone.  The price was very good so I took a chance and ordered them. The earrings are a perfect color match to the pendant.  I am very pleased!"
This bag is sturdy and roomy
"I was so thrilled that Fitflop came out with a sandal that doesn't look all rubbery.  This is their first all leather one.  Very stylish.  Especially when you have foot problems and your doctor tells you you can wear these or orthopedic shoes.  Safe to say, I have every fitflop that has ever been produced and this is the best one yet.  I hope they continue to up their style game."
is fabulous...thanks
I have gotten so many compliments in this dress.  Sexy and it sits perfect to hide any sign of belly! Haha.  Washes nice
Bought it for my daughter and neither she nor her friends could believe it was a croc. She got good reviews and that satisfied me. Slipper is comfortable and stylish.
"great bra,fits well"
"Love this top! Fits very well and looks good with jeans, dress pants and leggings."
Love these! I even bought 3 more after this!
My wife loved her gift
Excellent!  Love it. Will probably order a brown one.
"I just love this wristlet purse. Huge fan of Snoopy. Its perfect for that days when you don't want to carry a lot of stuff, just your cards and phone. Item arrived on time and in perfect conditions. Exactly as shown in the pictures and came with the coach tag. Very happy!"
"Great shoe, very pretty. Pretty comfy as heels go."
"The ring is a tad on the heavy side, but overall extremely well made and the sizing is accurate. I have wore it for almost a week now and not a single scratch. I am pretty rough on rings due to my line of work so I am very pleased at how well it has held up. Save yourself a ton of money and buy from Amazon rather than a jewelry store or Walmart. A similar ring at Walmart is $50 plus tax."
"Good looking, well made and comfortable,"
A little wider than expected but still fits ok.
"It's so hard to find one piece suits for my long torso girls. I do purchase them 2 sizes larger to get a perfect fit. This suit covers them in the front, stays out of their bums, has no strings to fiddle with, and holds it's shape and appearance through continuous wear all summer. My children spend so much time in the pool that they tend to eat, sleep, wear the suits under their clothes, and jump on the trampoline before jumping back in the pool. For the last 2 years I have purchased each of them 2 suits and at the end of the summer the suits are still nice. This cut is also available in several different colors and patterns so they are always excited to get something completely new and different. One con; the suits have enough fabric to cover, but not really enough support to handle developing busts in older girls. I'm sad that this summer I will have to search for something different for my oldest daughter."
Have had a lot of backpacks through the years. This one fits better and works great. Not sure I would change anything.
"Although it was an impulse purchase that I'll probably never to rarely use, it looks and functions just as described.  Also it got here much faster than I expected."
Thanks to everyone who put pics and instructions on how to put this on in their reviews. It would have been impossible to figure out without your help. Fit my wife's larger bust (38DDD). Looked badass and fit right in at a metal show. She got asked a few times by other women where she bought it. I say that's testament enough to how metal it is.
love the sneakers thankyou
COLOR WAS A LITTLE OFF BUT IT WAS SO CUTE!!!  NICE FIT NICE MATIERIAL
"Super comfy, I can barely tell I'm wearing it half the time."
I purchased to apply my Bondi sands tanning lotion and it works great.
Fit perfect arrived on time and it was beautiful.
These fit in my normal 6 1/2 but they were very wide around my ankle so for that reason I had to return them
Good comfortable cushioned running shoe; fits and laces up for a stable run.  I run 3 to 5 miles per day; the shoes don't have much arch support; but they do cushion for forefoot and heel strike.
These are soo soft and beautifully made. They do run smaller than other gowns so unfortunately my grandson won't wear them as long. They are however very soft and very well made. Extremely happy with purchase. Wish I could get them in a larger size as well
"Great style, and comfort to match."
Love these boots.  Comfortable fit.
"I work out almost daily - weights, kickbox & treadmill.  These offer comfort, support & an arch which has helped my plantars fasciitis!!"
"These are such nice little panties.  They are comfortable and you can't beat the price, since it's a name brand.  Also, very they're so pretty!  I'll be ordering more because I like my underwear looking ""new"" at all times.  So, I replace panties often.  I'd recommend this item to anyone."
"Bought this for my granddaughter, and it fit perfectly."
These little locks are great for my luggage.
"They are adorable and my granddaughter loves them, but they do run a little small."
"It's perfect, and soft"
"Love the soft leather on these boots, very comfy and stylish."
"Awesome ideal, I put them on my luggage and everyone at the airport wants one. Super ideal, thanks so much!"
"Perfect. Not thin material, soft, fits well, perfect length."
"Have been on the hunt for a an octagonal two tone watch with either tick marks or roman numerals, and a champaign dial.  This is pretty close, and I am happy with the quality.  I like the idea of never needing to replace the battery.  The bracelet is generously sized; most will need to remove a few links. (You don't need a special tool, just a paper clip and needle nosed pliers: push the pins down in the direction of the arrows against a layer of cloth or tissue.  The pins will pop right out.)

I took off one star for the goofy half-second tick marks on the face of the watch, though.  What earthly use is a half-second tick mark on an analog watch with an indexed second-hand that mechanically CAN'T stop between full seconds?  It's just visual clutter, and makes the dial look like it is ringed with stubble.  It's a really unfortunate effect since the watch otherwise looks elegant.  However, there aren't so many two tone watches with dodecagons (and I failed to find an octagon)  around the dial.  They look very classy and people comment on the shape. I like the look of the rest of the watch well enough to keep it and am training my eyes to ignore the 120 tick marks around the edge of the dial.  Overall, a nice watch."
A tried and true performer for me.  I own many colors.  The only issue I have ever had was with a purple one; over time the color faded on the shoulders and upper back from the sun.
"I ordered these earrings right before a trip I had. The earrings themselves I really like, they are lightweight and good size and would recommend for other people to get. However, be aware that you will beep at the airport security metal detector when passing through airport security. I travel several times a year and this has never happened before. Once I took my earrings off the detector stopped beeping."
"I usually wear a large, but this tank top fits a big big. Other than that, I like it. Looks nice."
Can never have enough fuzzy socks! I have small feet so these come up about mid calf on me and then slip down as I wear them. They do fall off if I wear them in bed but they aren't really made to stay up high or be constricting. They are fuzzy socks for pete's sake!
Price was awesome.
